Argument in Multi-Agent Systems Multi-agent systems research is concerned both with the modelling of human and animal societies and with the development of principles for the design of practical distributed information management systems. This position paper will, rather than examine the various dierences in perspective within this area of research, discuss issues of communication and commitment that are of interest to multi-agent systems research in general. 1 Introduction A computational society is a collection of autonomous agents that are loosely dependent upon each other. The intentional stance [12] is often taken in describing the state of these agents. An agent may have beliefs, desires, intentions, and it may adopt a role or have relationships with others. Thus, multi-agent systems (MAS) as with most AI research is signi cantly inuenced, at least in its vocabulary, by philosophy and cognitive psychology. 1 So, what's the point? Computational societies are developed for two primary reasons:  Mode...

Decomposition in Data Mining: An Industrial Case Study Data mining offers tools for discovery of relationships, patterns, and knowledge in large databases. The knowledge extraction process is computationally complex and therefore a subset of all data is normally considered for mining. In this paper, numerous methods for decomposition of data sets are discussed. Decomposition enhances the quality of knowledge extracted from large databases by simplification of the data mining task. The ideas presented are illustrated with examples and an industrial case study. In the case study reported in this paper, a data mining approach is applied to extract knowledge from a data set. The extracted knowledge is used for the prediction and prevention of manufacturing faults in wafers.

Exploration versus Exploitation in Topic Driven Crawlers Topic driven crawlers are increasingly seen as a way to address the scalability limitations of universal search engines, by distributing the crawling process across users, queries, or even client computers. The context available to a topic driven crawler allows for informed decisions about how to prioritize the links to be explored, given time and bandwidth constraints. We have developed a framework and a number of methods to evaluate the performance of topic driven crawler algorithms in a fair way, under limited memory resources. Quality metrics are derived from lexical features, link analysis, and a hybrid combination of the two. In this paper we focus on the issue of how greedy a crawler should be. Given noisy quality estimates of links in a frontier, we investigate what is an appropriate balance between a crawler's need to exploit this information to focus on the most promising links, and the need to explore links that appear suboptimal but might lead to more relevant pages. We show that exploration is essential to locate the most relevant pages under a number of quality measures, in spite of a penalty in the early stage of the crawl.

Software Engineering and Middleware: A Roadmap The construction of a large class of distributed systems can be simplified by leveraging middleware, which is layered between network operating systems and application components. Middleware resolves heterogeneity, and facilitates communication and coordination of distributed components. State of-the-practice middleware products enable software engineers to build systems that are distributed across a localarea network. State-of-the-art middleware research aims to push this boundary towards Internet-scale distribution, adaptive systems, middleware for dependable and wireless systems. The challenge for software engineering research is to devise notations, techniques, methods and tools for distributed system construction that systematically build and exploit the capabilities that middleware products deliver, now and in the future.

Dynamic-Agents for Dynamic Service Provisioning We claim that a dynamic-agent infrastructure can provide a shift from static distributed computing to dynamic distributed computing, and we have developed such an infrastructure to realize such a shift. We shall show its impact on software engineering through a comparison with other distributed object-oriented systems such as CORBA and DCOM, and demonstrate its value in highly dynamic system integration and service provisioning.  The infrastructure is Java-based, light-weight, and extensible. It differs from other agent platforms and client/server infrastructures in its support of dynamic behavior modification of agents. A dynamic-agent is not designed to have a fixed set of predefined functions but instead, to carry application-specific actions, which can be loaded and modified on the fly. This allows a dynamic-agent to adjust its capability for accommodating environment and requirement changes, and play different roles across multiple applications.  The above features are supported b...

A Hybrid Mobile Robot Architecture with Integrated Planning and Control Research in the planning and control of mobile robots has received much attention in the past two decades. Two basic approaches have emerged from these research efforts: deliberative vs. reactive. These two approaches can be distinguished by their different usage of sensed data and global knowledge, speed of response, reasoning capability, and complexity of computation. Their strengths are complementary and their weaknesses can be mitigated by combining the two approaches in a hybrid architecture. This paper describes a method for goal-directed, collision-free navigation in unpredictable environments that employs a behavior-based hybrid architecture with asynchronously operating behavioral modules. It differs from existing hybrid architectures in two important ways: (1) the planning module produces a sequence of checkpoints instead of a conventional complete path, and (2) in addition to obstacle avoidance, the reactive module also performs target reaching under the control of a self-organizing neural network. The neural network is trained to perform fine, smooth motor control that moves the robot through the checkpoints. These two aspects facilitate a tight integration between high-level planning and low-level control, which permits real-time performance and easy path modification even when the robot is en route to the goal position.

Optimal External Memory Interval Management  In this paper we present the external interval tree, an optimal external memory data structure for answering stabbing queries on a set of dynamically maintained intervals. The external interval tree can be used in an optimal solution to the dynamic interval management problem, which is a central problem for object-oriented and temporal databases and for constraint logic programming. Part of the structure uses a weight-balancing technique for efficient worst-case manipulation of balanced trees, which is of independent interest. The external interval tree, as well as our new balancing technique, have recently been used to develop several efficient external data structures.

Using PageRank to Characterize Web Structure Recent work on modeling the Web graph has dwelt on capturing  the degree distributions observed on the Web. Pointing out that  this represents a heavy reliance on "local" properties of the Web graph,  we study the distribution of PageRank values (used in the Google search  engine) on the Web. This distribution is of independent interest in optimizing  search indices and storage. We show that PageRank values on  the Web follow a power law. We then develop detailed models for the  Web graph that explain this observation, and moreover remain faithful  to previously studied degree distributions. We analyze these models,  and compare the analyses to both snapshots from the Web and to graphs  generated by simulations on the new models. To our knowledge this represents  the first modeling of the Web that goes beyond fitting degree  distributions on the Web.

A Foundation for Conventional and Temporal Query Optimization Addressing Duplicates and Ordering Abstract√êMost real-world databases contain substantial amounts of time-referenced, or temporal, data. Recent advances in temporal query languages show that such database applications may benefit substantially from built-in temporal support in the DBMS. To achieve this, temporal query representation, optimization, and processing mechanisms must be provided. This paper presents a foundation for query optimization that integrates conventional and temporal query optimization and is suitable for both conventional DBMS architectures and ones where the temporal support is obtained via a layer on top of a conventional DBMS. This foundation captures duplicates and ordering for all queries, as well as coalescing for temporal queries, thus generalizing all existing approaches known to the authors. It includes a temporally extended relational algebra to which SQL and temporal SQL queries may be mapped, six types of algebraic equivalences, concrete query transformation rules that obey different equivalences, a procedure for determining which types of transformation rules are applicable for optimizing a query, and a query plan enumeration algorithm. The presented approach partitions the work required by the database implementor to develop a provably correct query optimizer into four stages: The database implementor has to 1) specify operations formally, 2) design and prove correct appropriate transformation rules that satisfy any of the six equivalence types, 3) augment the mechanism that determines when the different types of rules are applicable to ensure that the enumeration algorithm applies the rules correctly, and 4) ensure that the mapping generates a correct initial query plan. Index Terms√êTemporal databases, query optimization, transformation rules, temporal algebra, duplicate elimination, coalescing. 1

Use of Satellite Image Referencing Algorithms to Characterize Asphaltic Concrete Mixtures A natural way to test the structural integrity of a pavement is to send signals with different frequencies through the pavement and compare the results with the signals passing through an ideal pavement. For this comparison, we must determine how, for the corresponding mixture, the elasticity E depends on the frequency f in the range from 0.1 to 10  5  Hz. It is very expensive to perform measurements in high frequency area (above 20 Hz). To avoid these measurements, we can use the fact that for most of these mixtures, when we change a temperature, the new dependence changes simply by scaling. Thus, instead of performing expensive measurements for different frequencies, we can measure the dependence of E on moderate frequencies f for different temperatures, and then combine the resulting curves into a single "master" curve. In this paper, we show how fuzzy techniques can help to automate this "combination".

Virtual Information Towers - A Metaphor for Intuitive, Location-Aware Information Access in a Mobile Environment This paper introduces Virtual Information Towers (VITs) as a concept for presenting and accessing location-aware information with mobile clients. A VIT is a means of structuring location-aware information, which is assigned to a certain geographical position while having a certain area of visibility. A user equipped with a mobile, wearable computer has access to the VITs which are "visible" from his/her current location. The architecture and protocols of a system are described, which allows its users to create VITs and to access the information on them using Internet mechanisms. We have implemented a prototype of this system and a VIT client for a wearable computer and will present some aspects of this implementation. 1 Introduction  Mobile information access is an important field of application for wearable computers. In a mobile environment much of the accessed information is location-dependent, i.e. the content of the information or the user's interest in the information depends on ...

Off-line Learning of Coordination in Functionally Structured Agents for Distributed Data Processing When we design multi-agent systems for realistic, worth-oriented environments, coordination problems they present involve intricate and sophisticated interplay between the domain and the various system components. Achieving effective coordination in such systems is a difficult problem for a number of reasons like local views of problem-solving task and uncertainty about the outcomes of interacting non-local tasks. In this paper, we present a learning algorithm that endows agents with the capability to choose an appropriate coordination algorithm based on the present problem solving situation in the domain of distributed data processing. 1 Introduction Achieving effective coordination in a multi-agent system is a difficult problem for a number of reasons. The first is that an agent's control decisions, based only on its local view of problem-solving task structures, may lead to inappropriate decisions about which activity it should do next, what results it should transmit to other agen...

A Case for Parallelism in Data Warehousing and OLAP In recent years the database community has experienced a tremendous increase in the availability of new technologies to support efficient storage and retrieval of large volumes of data, namely data warehousing and  On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) products. Efficient query processing is critical in such an environment, yet achieving quick response times with OLAP queries is still largely an open issue. In this paper we propose a solution approach to this problem by applying  parallel processing techniques to a warehouse environment. We suggest an efficient partitioning strategy based on the relational representation of a data warehouse (i.e., star schema). Furthermore, we incorporate a particular indexing strategy, DataIndexes, to further improve query processing times and parallel resource utilization, and propose a preliminary parallel star-join strategy. 1 Introduction  In recent years, there has been an explosive growth in the use of databases for decision support.

Error-Driven Pruning of Treebank Grammars for Base Noun Phrase Identification Finding simple, non-recursive, base noun phrases is an important subtask for many natural language processing applications. While previous empirical methods for base NP identification have been rather complex, this paper instead proposes a very simple algorithm that is tailored to the relative simplicity of the task. In particular, we present a corpus-based approach for finding base NPs by matching part-ofspeech tag sequences. The training phase of the algorithm is based on two successful techniques: first the base NP grammar is read from a "treebank" corpus; then the grammar is improved by selecting rules with high "benefit" scores. Using this simple algorithm with a naive heuristic for matching rules, we achieve surprising accuracy in an evaluation on the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal.  1 Introduction  Finding base noun phrases is a sensible first step for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks: Accurate identification of base noun phrases is arguably the most critical comp...

A State-of-the-art Review on Multimodal Video Indexing Efficient and effective handling of video documents depends on the availability of indexes. Manual indexing is unfeasible for large video collections. Effective indexing requires a multimodal approach in which either the most appropriate modality is selected or the different modalities are used in collaborative fashion. In this paper we focus on the similarities and differences between the modalities, and survey several methods aiming at automating the time and resource consuming process of video indexing. Furthermore, we put forward a unifying and multimodal framework, which views a video document from the perspective of its author. This framework forms the guiding principle for identifying index types, for which automatic methods are found in literature. It furthermore forms the basis for categorizing these different methods.

Discovering Web Access Patterns and Trends by Applying OLAP and Data Mining Technology on Web Logs As a confluence of data mining and WWW technologies, it is now possible to perform data mining on web log records collected from the Internet web page access history. The behaviour of the web page readers is imprinted in the web server log files. Analyzing and exploring regularities in this behaviour can improve system performance, enhance the quality and delivery of Internet information services to the end user, and identify population of potential customers for electronic commerce. Thus, by observing people using collections of data, data mining can bring considerable contribution to digital library designers. In a joint effort between the TeleLearning-NCE project on Virtual University and NCE-IRIS project on data mining, we have been developing the knowledge discovery tool, WebLogMiner, for mining web server log files. This paper presents the design of the WebLogMiner, reports the current progress, and outlines the future work in this direction.

Managing the Operator Ordering Problem in Parallel Databases This paper focuses on parallel query optimization. We consider the operator problem and introduce a new class of execution strategies called Linear-Oriented Bushy Trees (LBT). Compared to the related approach of the General Bushy Trees (GBT) a significant complexity reduction of the operator ordering problem can be derived theoretically and demonstrated experimentally (e.g. compared with GBTs, LBTs authorize optimization time improvement that can reach up-to 49%) without loosing quality. Finally we demonstrate that existing commercial parallel query optimizers need little extension modifications in order to handle LBTs.  Key words: Parallel databases, parallel query optimization, linear-oriented bushy  trees, extending existing optimizers.  1 Introduction  Modern database applications, such as data mining and decision support pose several new challenges to query optimization and processing [1].

SpeechBot: a Speech Recognition based Audio Indexing System for the Web We have developed an audio search engine incorporating speech recognition technology. This allows indexing of spoken documents from the World Wide Web when no transcription is available. This site indexes several talk and news radio shows covering a wide range of topics and speaking styles from a selection of public Web sites with multimedia archives. Our Web site is similar in spirit to normal Web search sites; it contains an index, not the actual multimedia content. The audio from these shows suffers in acoustic quality due to bandwidth limitations, coding, compression, and poor acoustic conditions. The shows are typically sampled at 8 kHz and transmitted, RealAudio compressed, at 6.5 kbps. Our word-error rate results using appropriately trained acoustic models show remarkable resilience to the high compression, though many factors combine to increase the average word-error rates over standard broadcast news benchmarks.

Actor-Critic Algorithms We propose and analyze a class of actor-critic algorithms for  simulation-based optimization of a Markov decision process over  a parameterized family of randomized stationary policies. These  are two-time-scale algorithms in which the critic uses TD learning  with a linear approximation architecture and the actor is updated  in an approximate gradient direction based on information provided  by the critic. We show that the features for the critic should  span a subspace prescribed by the choice of parameterization of the  actor. We conclude by discussing convergence properties and some  open problems.  1 Introduction  The vast majority of Reinforcement Learning (RL) [9] and Neuro-Dynamic Programming (NDP) [1] methods fall into one of the following two categories:  (a) Actor-only methods work with a parameterized family of policies.

Computing and Comparing Semantics of Programs in Four-valued Logics The different semantics that can be assigned to a logic program correspond to different assumptions made concerning the atoms whose logical values cannot be inferred from the rules. Thus, the well founded semantics corresponds to the assumption that every such atom is false, while the Kripke-Kleene semantics corresponds to the assumption that every such atom is unknown. In this paper, we propose to unify and extend this assumption-based approach by introducing parameterized semantics for logic programs. The parameter holds the value that one assumes for all atoms whose logical values cannot be inferred from the rules. We work within Belnap's four-valued logic, and we consider the class of logic programs defined by Fitting. Following Fitting's approach, we define a simple operator that allows us to compute the parameterized semantics, and to compare and combine semantics obtained for different values of the parameter. The semantics proposed by Fitting corresponds to the value false. We also show that our approach captures and extends the usual semantics of conventional logic programs thereby unifying their computation.

A Pattern Approach to Interaction Design To create successful interactive systems, user interface designers need to cooperate with developers and application domain experts in an interdisciplinary team. These groups, however, usually miss a common terminology to exchange ideas, opinions, and values. This paper presents an approach that uses pattern languages to capture this knowledge in software development, HCI, and the application domain. A formal, domain-independent definition of design patterns allows for computer support without sacrificing readability, and pattern use is integrated into the usability engineering lifecycle. As an example, experience from building an award-winning interactive music exhibit was turned into a pattern language, which was then used to inform follow-up projects and support HCI education.

Communication Primitives for Ubiquitous Systems or RPC Considered Harmful RPC is widely used to access and modify remote state. Its procedural call semantics are argued as an efficient unifying paradigm for both local and remote access. Our experience with ubiquitous device control systems has shown otherwise. RPC semantics of a synchronous, blocking invocation on a statically typed interface are overly restrictive, inflexible, and fail to provide an efficient unifying abstraction for accessing and modifying state in ubiquitous systems. This position paper considers other alternatives and proposes the use of comvets (conditional, mobility aware events) as the unifying generic communication paradigm for such systems.

In this paper, with a focus on efficiency and concreteness, we propose a pragmatic  first step toward the systematic benchmarking of XML query processing platforms. We begin by  identifying the necessary functionalities an XML data management system should support. We  review existing approaches for managing XML data and the query processing capabilities of these  approaches. We then compare three XML query benchmarks XMach-1, XMark and XOO7 and  discuss the applicability, strengths and limitations of these benchmarks. We highlight the bias of  these benchmarks towards the data centric view of XML and motivate our selection of XOO7 to  extend with document centric queries. We complete XOO7 to capture the information retrieval  capabilities of XML management systems. Finally we summarize our contributions and discuss  future directions.

dQUOB: Managing Large Data Flows Using Dynamic Embedded Queries The dQUOB system satisfies client need for specific information from high-volume data streams. The data streams we speak of are the flow of data existing during large-scale visualizations, video streaming to large numbers of distributed users, and high volume business transactions. We introduces the notion of conceptualizing a data stream as a set of relational database tables so that a scientist can request information with an SQL-like query. Transformation or computation that often needs to be performed on the data en-route can be conceptualized ascomputation performed onconsecutive views of the data, with computation associated with each view. The dQUOB system moves the query code into the data stream as a quoblet; as compiled code. The relational database data model has the significant advantage of presenting opportunities for efficient reoptimizations of queries and sets of queries. Using examples from global atmospheric modeling, we illustrate the usefulness of the dQUOB system. We carry the examples through the experiments to establish the viability of the approach for high performance computing with a baseline benchmark. We define a cost-metric of end-to-end latency that can be used to determine realistic cases where optimization should be applied. Finally, we show that end-to-end latency can be controlled through a probability assigned to a query that a query will evaluate to true.

Computer Response to User Frustration Use of computer technology often has unpleasant side effects, some of which are strong, negative emotional states that arise in humans during interaction with computers. Frustration, confusion, anger, anxiety and similar emotional states can affect not only the interaction itself, but also productivity, learning, social relationships, and overall well-being. This thesis presents the idea of designing human-computer interaction systems to actively support human users in their ability to regulate, manage, and recover from their own negative emotional states, particularly frustration. This document describes traditional theoretical strategies for emotion regulation, the design of a human-computer interaction agent built by the author to actively help relieve frustration, and an evaluation that shows the effectiveness of the agent. A study designed to test this agent was conducted: A system was built that elicits frustration in human subjects. The interaction agent then initiated several social, emotional-content feedback strategies with some of the subjects, in an effort to help relieve their emotional state. These strategies were designed to provide many of the same cues that skilled, human listeners employ when helping relieve strong, negative emotions in others. Two control groups were exposed to the same frustrating stimuli, one of which was given no emotional support at all; the other enabled subjects to report problems and "vent" at the computer. Subsequent behavior was then observed, and self-report data was collected. Behavioral results showed the agent was significantly more effective than the two controls in helping relieve frustration levels in subjects. These results demonstrate that strategic, social, emotional-content interaction with a computer by users who ...

Formal Concepts of Learning Systems Validation in Use In the problem area of evaluating complex software  systems, there are two distinguished areas of research,  development, and application identified by the two  buzzwords validation and verification, respectively.  From the perspective adopted by the authors  (cf. (O'Keefe & O'Leary 1993), e.g.), verification is  usually more formally based and, thus, can be supported  by formal reasoning tools like theorem provers,  for instance.  The scope of verification approaches is limited by the  difficulty of finding a sufficiently complete formalization  to built upon. In paramount realistic problem  domains, validation seems to be more appropriate, although  it is less stringent in character and, therefore,  validation results are often less definite.  The aim of this paper is to exemplify a validation approach  based on a clear and thoroughly formal theory.  In this way, validation and verification should be  brought closer to each other, for the benefit of a concerted  action towards depend...

We generate a web graph in XGMML format for a web site using the web robot of the WWWPal system (developed for web visualization and organization). We generate web-log reports in LOGML format for a web site from web log files and the web graph. In this paper, we further illustrate the usefulness of these two XML applications with a web data mining example. Moreover, we show the simplicity with which this mining algorithm can be specified and implemented efficiently using our two XML applications. We provide sample results, namely frequent patterns of users in a web site, with our web data mining algorithm.

Minimizing View Sets without Losing Query-Answering Power The problem of answering queries using views has been studied extensively, due to its relevance in a wide variety of data-management applications. In these applications, we often need to select a subset of views to maintain, due to limited resources. In this paper, we show that traditional query containment is not a good basis for deciding whether or not a view should be selected. Instead, we should minimize the view set without losing query-answering power. To formalize this notion, we rst introduce the concept of "p-containment." That is, a view set V is p-contained in another view set W, if W can answer all the queries that can be answered by V. We show that p-containment and the traditional query containment are not related; i.e., one does not imply the other. We then discuss how to minimize a view set while retaining its query-answering power. We develop the idea further by considering p-containment of two view sets with respect to a given set of queries, and consider their relationship in terms of maximally-contained rewritings of queries using the views.

Towards Group Communication for Mobile Participants (Extended Abstract) Group communication will undoubtedly be a useful paradigm for many applications of wireless networking in which reliability and timeliness are requirements. Moreover, location awareness is clearly central to mobile applications such as traffic management and smart spaces. In this paper, we introduce our definition of proximity groups in which group membership depends on location and then discuss some requirements for a group membership management service suitable for proximity groups. We describe a novel approach to efficient coverage estimation, giving applications feedback on the proportion of the area of interest covered by a proximity group, and also discuss our approach to partition anticipation.

Estimating Resemblance of MIDI Documents Abstract. Search engines often employ techniques for determining syntactic similarity of Web pages. Such a tool allows them to avoid returning multiple copies of essentially the same page when a user makes a query. Here we describe our experience extending these techniques to MIDI music files. The music domain requires modification to cope with problems introduced in the musical setting, such as polyphony. Our experience suggests that when used properly these techniques prove useful for determining duplicates and clustering databases in the musical setting as well. 1

Distinctive Features Should Be Learned Most existing machine vision systems perform recognition based on a xed set  of hand-crafted features, geometric models, or eigen-subspace decomposition.  Drawing from psychology, neuroscience and intuition, we show that certain  aspects of human performance in visual discrimination cannot be explained by  any of these techniques. We argue that many practical recognition tasks for  articial vision systems operating under uncontrolled conditions critically depend  on incremental learning. Loosely motivated by visuocortical processing,  we present feature representations and learning methods that perform biologically  plausible functions. The paper concludes with experimental results  generated by our method.  1 Introduction  How exible are the representations for visual recognition, encoded by the neurons of the human visual cortex? Are they predetermined by a xed developmental schedule, or does their development depend on their stimulation? Does their development cease at some poin...

Interaction between Path and Type Constraints XML [7], which is emerging as an important standard for data exchange on the World-Wide Web, highlights the importance of semistructured data. Although the XML standard itself does not require any schema or type system, a number of proposals [6, 17, 19] have been developed that roughly correspond to data definition languages. These allow one to constrain the structure of XML data by imposing a schema on it. These and other proposals also advocate the need for integrity constraints, another form of constraints that should, for example, be capable of expressing inclusion constraints and inverse relationships. The latter have recently been studied as path constraints in the context of semistructured data [4, 9]. It is likely that future XML proposals will involve both forms of constraints, and it is therefore appropriate to understand the interaction between them. This paper investigates that interaction. In particular it studies constraint implication problems, which are important both i...

Aspects of Network Edge Intelligence Is it the case that the migration of intelligence from the core of networks to the  periphery is simply a function of the IP protocols? Or are there more fundamental  forces at work? This report addresses this issue from the perspective of core network  protocols, mobile networking and the emerging embedded Internet. It identifies the  forces at work, and concludes that the long term trends are driven by more than simply  the end-to-end argument. If the logical progression of this trend is that intelligence  will migrate to the embedded Internet, then a new type of peripheral intelligence may  form the basis for further progress. The report concludes by identifying the challenges  for the embedded Internet in constructed environments.

Robustness of Case-Initialized Genetic Algorithms We investigate the robustness of Case Initialized Genetic AlgoRithm (CIGAR) systems with respect to problem indexing. When confronted with a series of similar problems CIGAR stores potential solutions in a case-base or an associative memory and retrieves and uses these solutions to help improve a genetic algorithm 's performance over time. Defining similarity among the problems, or indexing, is key to performance improvement. We study four indexing schemes on a class of simple problems and provide empirical evidence of CIGAR's robustness to imperfect indexing.

Learning to Tag for Information Extraction from Text . LearningPINOCCHIO is an algorithm for adaptive information extraction. It learns template filling rules that insert SGML tags into texts. LearningPINOCCHIO is based on a covering algorithm that learns rules by bottom-up generalization of instances in a tagged corpus. It has been tested on three scenarios in informal domains in two languages (Italian and English). Experiments report excellent results with respect to the current state of the art. 1 Introduction By general agreement the main barriers to wide use and commercialization of IE are the difficulties in adapting systems to new applications and domains.

A Natural Interface to a Virtual Environment through Computer Vision-estimated Pointing Gestures . This paper describes the development of a natural interface to a virtual  environment. The interface is through a natural pointing gesture and replaces  pointing devices which are normally used to interact with virtual environments.  The pointing gesture is estimated in 3D using kinematic knowledge of the arm  during pointing and monocular computer vision. The latter is used to extract the  2D position of the user's hand and map it into 3D. Off-line tests of the system  show promising results with an average errors of 76mm when pointing at a screen  2m away. The implementation of a real time system is currently in progress and  is expected to run with 25Hz.  1

Economic Markets as a Means of Open Mobile-Agent Systems Mobile-agent systems have gained popularity in use because they ease the application design process by giving software engineers greater flexibility. Although the value of any network is dependent on both the number of users and the number of sites participating in the network, there is little motivation for systems to donate resources to arbitrary agents. We propose to remedy the problem by imposing an economic market on mobile-agent systems where agents purchase resources from host sites and sell services to users and other agents. Host sites accumulate revenues, which are distributed to users to be used to launch more agents. We argue for the use of markets to regulate mobile-agent systems and discuss open issues in implementing market-based mobile-agent systems. 1 Introduction  One of the more recent items in a network programmer's tool box is code mobility.

Graphical Models for Recognizing Human Interactions We describe a real-time computer vision and machine learning system for modeling and recognizing human actions and interactions. Two different domains are explored: recognition of two-handed motions in the martial art 'Tai Chi', and multiple-person interactions in a visual surveillance task. Our system combines top-down with bottom-up information using a feedback loop, and is formulated with a Bayesian framework. Two different graphical models (HMMs and Coupled HMMs) are used for modeling both individual actions and multiple-agent interactions, and CHMMs are shown to work more efficiently and accurately for a given amount of training. Finally, to overcome the limited amounts of training data, we demonstrate that `synthetic agents' (Alife-style agents) can be used to develop flexible prior models of the person-to-person interactions.   1 INTRODUCTION  We describe a real-time computer vision and machine learning system for modeling and recognizing human behaviors in two different scenari...

Adaptive Load Sharing for Network Processors A novel scheme for processing packets in a router is presented, which provides for load sharing among multiple network processors distributed within the router. It is complemented by a feedback control mechanism designed to prevent processor overload. Incoming traffic is scheduled to multiple processors based on a deterministic mapping. The mapping formula is derived from the robust hash routing (also known as the highest random weight - HRW) scheme, introduced in K.W. Ross, IEEE Network, 11(6), 1997, and D.G. Thaler et al., IEEE Trans. Networking, 6(1), 1998. No state information on individual flow mapping needs to be stored, but for each packet, a mapping function is computed over an identifier vector, a predefined set of fields in the packet. An adaptive extension to the HRW scheme is provided in order to cope with biased traffic patterns. We prove that our adaptation possesses the minimal disruption property with respect to the mapping and exploit that property in order to minimize the probability of flow reordering. Simulation results indicate that the scheme achieves significant improvements in processor utilization. A higher number of router interfaces can thus be supported with the same amount of processing power. I.

A Geometric Framework for Specifying Spatiotemporal Objects We present a framework for specifying spatiotemporal objects using spatial and temporal objects, and a geometric transformation. We define a number of classes of spatiotemporal objects and study their closure properties.  1 Introduction  Many natural or man-made phenomena have both a spatial and a temporal extent. Consider for example, a forest fire or property histories in a city. To store information about such phenomena in a database one needs appropriate data modeling constructs. We claim that a new concept, spatiotemporal object, is necessary. In this paper, we introduce a very general framework for specifying spatiotemporal objects. To define a spatiotemporal object we need a spatial object, a temporal object, and a continuous geometric transformation (specified using a parametric representation) that determines the image of the spatial object at different time instants belonging to the temporal object. In this framework, a number of classes of spatiotemporal objects arise quite ...

Information-Theoretic Learning This chapter seeks to extend the ubiquitous mean-square error criterion (MSE) to cost functions that include more information about the training data. Since the learning process ultimately should transfer the information carried in the data samples onto the system's parameters, a natural goal is to find cost functions that directly manipulate information. Hence the name informationtheoretic learning (ITL). In order to be useful, ITL should be independent of the learning machine architecture, and require solely the availability of the data, i.e. it should not require a priori assumptions about the data distributions. The chapter presents our current efforts to develop ITL criteria based on the integration of nonparametric density estimators with Renyi's quadratic entropy definition. As a motivation we start with an application of the MSE to manipulate information using the nonlinear characteristics of the learning machine. This section illustrates the issues faced when we attempt to use...

First-Order Polynomial Based Theorem Proving Introduction  The Boolean ring or first-order polynomial based theorem proving began with the work of Hsiang (1982, 1985). Hsiang extended the idea of using Boolean polynomials to represent propositional formulae to the case of first-order predicate calculus. Based on the completion procedure of Knuth and Bendix (1970), the N-strategy was proposed. Later on, by imitating the framework of Buchberger 's algorithm to compute the Grobner bases of polynomial ideals (Buchberger 1985), Kapur and Narendran (1985) developed another approach which is also referred to as the Grobner basis method.  One obvious advantage of using Boolean polynomials is that every propositional formula has a unique representation, and sometimes it is easy to be generalized to some non-classical logic systems (Chazarain et al. 1991; Wu and Tan 1994). Stimulated by them, some approaches and results have been reported (Bachmair and Dershowitz 1987; Dietrich 1986; Kapur and Zhang 1989; Wu and Liu 1998; Zhang 198

Learning Algorithms for Keyphrase Extraction Many academic journals ask their authors to provide a list of about five to fifteen keywords, to appear on the first page of each article. Since these key words are often phrases of two or more words, we prefer to call them keyphrases. There is a wide variety of tasks for which keyphrases are useful, as we discuss in this paper. We approach the problem of automatically extracting keyphrases from text as a supervised learning task. We treat a document as a set of phrases, which the learning algorithm must learn to classify as positive or negative examples of keyphrases. Our first set of experiments applies the C4.5 decision tree induction algorithm to this learning task. We evaluate the performance of nine different configurations of C4.5. The second set of experiments applies the GenEx algorithm to the task. We developed the GenEx algorithm specifically for automatically extracting keyphrases from text.

Object-Based Multimedia Content Description Schemes and Applications for MPEG-7 In this paper, we describe description schemes (DSs) for image, video, multimedia, home media, and archive content proposed to the MPEG-7 standard. MPEG-7 aims to create a multimedia content description standard in order to facilitate various multimedia searching and filtering applications.

Approximate Query Translation across Heterogeneous Information Sources (Extended Version) In this paper we present a mechanism for  approximately translating Boolean query constraints  across heterogeneous information sources.  Achieving the best translation is challenging because  sources support different constraints for formulating  queries, and often these constraints cannot  be precisely translated. For instance, a query  [score ? 8] might be "perfectly" translated as  [rating ? 0.8] at some site, but can only be approximated  as [grade = A] at another. Unlike  other work, our general framework adopts a customizable  "closeness" metric for the translation  that combines both precision and recall. Our results  show that for query translation we need to  handle interdependencies among both query conjuncts  as well as disjuncts. As the basis, we identify  the essential requirements of a rule system for  users to encode the mappings for atomic semantic  units. Our algorithm then translates complex  queries by rewriting them in terms of the semantic  units. We show that, un...

Bias, Variance, and Error Correcting Output Codes for Local Learners : This paper focuses on a bias variance decomposition analysis of a local learning algorithm, the nearest neighbor classifier, that has been extended with error correcting output codes. This extended algorithm often considerably reduces the 0-1 (i.e., classification) error in comparison with nearest neighbor (Ricci & Aha, 1997). The analysis presented here reveals that this performance improvement is obtained by drastically reducing bias at the cost of increasing variance. We also show that, even in classification problems with few classes (m5), extending the codeword length beyond the limit that assures column separation yields an error reduction. This error reduction is not only in the variance, which is due to the voting mechanism used for error-correcting output codes, but also in the bias.

Schema Evolution in Heterogeneous Database Architectures, A Schema Transformation Approach In previous work we have a developed general framework to support schema transformation and integration in heterogeneous database architectures. The framework consists of a hypergraph-based common data model and a set of primitive schema transformations defined for this model. Higher-level common data models and primitive schema transformations for them can be defined in terms of this lower-level model. A key feature of the framework is that both primitive and composite schema transformations are automatically reversible. We have shown in earlier work how this allows automatic query translation from a global schema to a set of source schemas. In this paper we show how our framework also readily supports  evolution of source schemas, allowing the global schema and the query translation pathways to be easily repaired, as opposed to having to be regenerated, after changes to source schemas. 1

Conveying Routes: Multimodal Generation and Spatial Intelligence In Embodied Conversational Agents In creating an embodied conversational agent (ECA) capable of conveying routes, it is necessary to understand how to present spatial information in an effective and natural manner. When conveying routes to someone, a person uses multiple modalities ¬ñ e.g., speech, gestures, and reference to a map ¬ñ to present information, and it is important to know precisely how these modalities are coordinated. With an understanding of how humans present spatial intelligence to give directions, it is then possible to create an ECA with similar capabilities.

From the results, a direction-giving model was created, and then implemented in the MACK (Media Lab Autonomous Conversational Kiosk) system.

Individual agents are subclasses of this generic shell that provide specific kinds of functionality.

Logical Transactions and Serializability The concept of logic databases can serve as a clear and expressive foundation of various information systems. However, the classical logic language only refers to a single database state, although in modern information systems it is necessary to take the dynamics into account. For this purpose, several update languages were proposed, among them [1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11], which allow to specify complex transitions from one database state to another. From the evaluation point of view, a complex state transition can and should be considered as a transaction. Up to now, the isolation property of transactions has been poorly addressed in the context of logic update languages, although it is an important problem even for classical, sequential transactions (see [2] for instance). In this paper we investigate how the serializability of logical transactions can be supported and what this means for the implementation of a transaction manager. 1 Introduction and Motivation  In [11, 12] we propose an up...

Optimising Propositional Modal Satisfiability for Description Logic Subsumption . Effective optimisation techniques can make a dramatic difference in the performance of knowledge representation systems based on expressive description logics. Because of the correspondence between description logics and propositional modal logic many of these techniques carry over into propositional modal logic satisfiability checking. Currently-implemented representation systems that employ these techniques, such as FaCT and DLP, make effective satisfiable checkers for various propositional modal logics. 1 Introduction  Description logics are a logical formalism for the representation of knowledge about individuals and descriptions of individuals. Description logics represent and reason with descriptions similar to "all people whose friends are both doctors and lawyers" or "all people whose children are doctors or lawyers or who have a child who has a spouse". The computations performed by systems that implement description logics are based around determining whether one descriptio...

The underlying equational logic chosen for Maude is membership equational logic, that has sorts, subsorts, operator overloading, and partiality definable by membership and equality conditions. Rewriting logic is reflective, in the sense of being able to express its own metalevel at the object level. Reflection is systematically exploited in Maude endowing the language with powerful metaprogramming capabilities, including both user-definable module operations and declarative strategies to guide the deduction process. This paper explains and illustrates with examples the main concepts of Maude's language design, including its underlying logic, functional, system and object-oriented modules, as well as parameterized modules, theories, and views. We also explain how Maude supports reflection, metaprogramming and internal strategies. The paper outlines the principles underlying the Maude system implementation, including its semicompilation techniques. We conclude with some remarks about applications, work on a formal environment for Maude, and a mobile language extension of Maude.

Virtual Notepad: Handwriting in Immersive VR We present Virtual Notepad, a collection of interface tools that allows the user to take notes, annotate documents and input text using a pen, while still immersed in virtual environments (VEs). Using a spatially-tracked, pressure-sensitive graphics tablet, pen and handwriting recognition software, Virtual Notepad explores handwriting as a new modality for interaction in immersive VEs. This paper reports details of the Virtual Notepad interface and interaction techniques, discusses implementation and design issues, reports the results of initial evaluation and overviews possible applications of virtual handwriting.  1. Introduction  Writing is a ubiquitous everyday activity. We jot down ideas and memos, scribble comments in the margins of a book or an article, annotate blueprints and design plans. Using computers, we type documents, complete forms and enter database queries. However, writing, taking notes or entering text in immersive VEs is almost impossible. Cut off from conventional...

Detecting traffic problems with ILP Expert systems for decision support have recently been successfully introduced in road transport management. These systems include knowledge on traffic problem detection and alleviation. The paper describes experiments in automated acquisition of knowledge on traffic problem detection. The task is to detect road sections where a problem has occured (critical sections) from sensor data. It is necessary to use inductive logic programming (ILP) for this purpose as relational background knowledge on the road network is essential. In this paper, we apply three state-of-the art ILP systems to learn how to detect traffic problems and compare their performance to the performance of a propositional learning system on the same problem. 1 Introduction Expert systems for decision support have recently been successfully introduced in road transport management. Some of the proposals in this direction are TRYS [5], KITS [4] and ARTIST [9]. From a general perspective, the goal of a real time traffi...

Modeling And Simulation Of Mobile Agents Agent-oriented software implies the realization of software components, which are mobile, autonomous, and solve problems by creating new software components during run-time, moving between locations, initiating or joining groups of other software components. Modeling and simulating those multiagent systems requires specific mechanisms for variable structure modeling.  JAMES, a Java-Based Agent Modeling Environment for Simulation, realizes variable structure models including mobility from the perspective of single autonomous agents. JAMES itself is based on parallel DEVS and adopts its abstract simulator model. Simulation takes place as a sending of messages between concurrently active and locally distributed entities which reflect the model's current structure. Thus, modeling and simulation are coined equally by an agent-based perspective.  1 Introduction  The definition of agents subsumes a multitude of different facets [30]. Agents are reactive, deliberative or combine reactive with ...

Parameterized Logic Programs where Computing Meets Learning Abstract. In this paper, we describe recent attempts to incorporate learning into logic programs as a step toward adaptive software that can learn from an environment. Although there are a variety of types of learning, we focus on parameter learning of logic programs, one for statistical learning by the EM algorithm and the other for reinforcement learning by learning automatons. Both attempts are not full- edged yet, but in the former case, thanks to the general framework and an e cient EM learning algorithm combined with a tabulated search, we have obtained very promising results that open up the prospect of modeling complex symbolic-statistical phenomena. 1

Object-relational Queries into Multidimensional Databases with the Active Data Repository As computational power and storage capacity increase, processing and analyzing large volumes  of multi-dimensional datasets play an increasingly important role in many domains of scientific research. Scientific applications that make use of very large scientific datasets have several  important characteristics: datasets consist of complex data and are usually multi-dimensional;  applications usually retrieve a subset of all the data available in the dataset; various application-specific operations are performed on the data items retrieved. Such applications can be supported  by object-relational database management systems (OR-DBMSs). In addition to providing  functionality to define new complex datatypes and user-defined functions, an OR-DBMS  for scientific datasets should contain runtime support that will provide optimized storage for  very large datasets and an execution environment for user-defined functions involving expensive  operations.

Least Squares Conformal Maps for Automatic Texture Atlas Generation A Texture Atlas is an efficient color representation for 3D Paint Systems. The model to be textured is decomposed into charts homeomorphic to discs, each chart is parameterized, and the unfolded charts are packed in texture space. Existing texture atlas methods for triangulated surfaces suffer from several limitations, requiring them to generate a large number of small charts with simple borders. The discontinuities between the charts cause artifacts, and make it difficult to paint large areas with regular patterns.

AntNet: Distributed Stigmergetic Control for Communications Networks This paper introduces AntNet, a novel approach to the adaptive learning of routing tables in communications networks. AntNet is a distributed, mobile agents based Monte Carlo system that was inspired by recent work on the ant colony metaphor for solving optimization problems. AntNet's agents concurrently explore the network and exchange collected information. The communication among the agents is indirect and asynchronous, mediated by the network itself. This form of communication is typical of social insects and is called stigmergy. We compare our algorithm with six state-of-the-art routing algorithms coming from the telecommunications and machine learning elds. The algorithms' performance is evaluated over a set of realistic testbeds. We run many experiments over real and arti cial IP datagram networks with increasing number of nodes and under several paradigmatic spatial and temporal tra c distributions. Results are very encouraging. AntNet showed superior performance under all the experimental conditions with respect to its competitors. We analyze the main characteristics of the algorithm and try to explain the reasons for its superiority. 1.

Automatically Analyzing and Organizing Music Archives . We are experiencing a tremendous increase in the amount of  music being made available in digital form. With the creation of large multimedia  collections, however, we need to devise ways to make those collections  accessible to the users. While music repositories exist today, they mostly  limit access to their content to query-based retrieval of their items based on  textual meta-information, with some advanced systems supporting acoustic  queries. What we would like to have additionally, is a way to facilitate exploration  of musical libraries. We thus need to automatically organize music  according to its sound characteristics in such a way that we nd similar  pieces of music grouped together, allowing us to nd a classical section, or  a hard-rock section etc. in a music repository.  In this paper we present an approach to obtain such an organization of  music data based on an extension to our SOMLib digital library system  for text documents. Particularly, we employ the Self-Organizing Map to  create a map of a musical archive, where pieces of music with similar sound  characteristics are organized next to each other on the two-dimensional map  display. Locating a piece of music on the map then leaves you with related  music next to it, allowing intuitive exploration of a music archive.

Improving Text Categorization Methods for Event Tracking Automated tracking of events from chronologically ordered document streams is a new challenge for statistical text classification. Existing learning techniques must be adapted or improved in order to effectively handle difficult situations where the number of positive training instances per event is extremely small, the majority of training documents are unlabelled, and most of the events have a short duration in time. We adapted several supervised text categorization methods, specifically several new variants of the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) algorithm and a Rocchio approach, to track events. All of these methods showed significant improvement (up to 71% reduction in weighted error rates) over the performance of the original kNN algorithm on TDT benchmark collections, making kNN among the top-performing systems in the recent TDT3 official evaluation. Furthermore, by combining these methods, we significantly reduced the variance in performance of our event tracking system over different ...

The Well-founded Semantics Is the Principle of Inductive Definition . Existing formalisations of (transfinite) inductive definitions in constructive mathematics are reviewed and strong correspondences with LP under least model and perfect model semantics become apparent. I point to fundamental restrictions of these existing formalisations and argue that the well-founded semantics (wfs) overcomes these problems and hence, provides a superior formalisation of the principle of inductive definition. The contribution of this study for LP is that it (re- )introduces the knowledge theoretic interpretation of LP as a logic for representing definitional knowledge. I point to fundamental differences between this knowledge theoretic interpretation of LP and the more commonly known interpretations of LP as default theories or auto-epistemic theories. The relevance is that differences in knowledge theoretic interpretation have strong impact on knowledge representation methodology and on extensions of the LP formalism, for example for representing uncertainty.

An Empirical Comparison of Decision Trees and Other Classification Methods Twenty two decision tree, nine statistical, and two neural network classifiers are compared on thirtytwo datasets in terms of classification error rate, computational time, and (in the case of trees) number of terminal nodes. It is found that the average error rates for a majority of the classifiers are not statistically significant but the computational times of the classifiers differ over a wide range. The statistical POLYCLASS classifier based on a logistic regression spline algorithm has the lowest average error rate. However, it is also one of the most computationally intensive. The classifier based on standard polytomous logistic regression and a decision tree classifier using the QUEST algorithm with linear splits have the second lowest average error rates and are about 50 times faster than POLYCLASS. Among decision tree classifiers with univariate splits, the classifiers based on the C4.5, IND-CART, and QUEST algorithms have the best combination of error rate and speed, althoug...

A Framework for Knowledge Management on the Semantic Web The Semantic Web can be a very promising platform for developing knowledge management systems. However, the problem is how to represent knowledge in the machine-understandable form, so that relevant knowledge can be found by machine agents. In this paper we present a knowledge management approach based on RDF-compatible format for representing rules and on a novel technique for the annotation of knowledge sources by using conditional statements. The approach is based on our existing Semantic Web tools. The main benefit is high improvement in the precision by searching for knowledge, as well as the possibility to retrieve a composition of knowledge sources which are relevant for the problem solving.

Attentional Objects for Visual Context Understanding This paper exploits wearable computers' unique opportunity to record and index the visual environment of the user from the "first-person" perspective. We propose to use a hat-mounted wearable camera to record what the user sees during the day with a wearable computer. This camera can be used to make the computer more contextually aware of the user and their actions. Furthermore, the camera can be used to record, analyze and index the visual environment of the user. By keeping track of the actions of the user upon and within the environment the system can be more aware of the interactions of the user within the environment. An important aspect of the system is to automatically extract objects of user interest, and their motion within the environment and relative to the user.  1 Introduction  Wearable computers have the potential to "see" as the user sees, "hear" as the user hears, and experience the life and the environment of the user in a "first-person" sense.

Fuzzy Triggers: Incorporating Imprecise Reasoning into Active Databases Traditional Event-Condition-Action triggers (active database rules) include a Boolean predicate as a trigger condition. We propose fuzzy triggers whereby fuzzy inference is utilized in the condition evaluation. This way, approximate reasoning may be integrated with a traditional crisp database. The new approach paves the way for intuitive expression of application semantics of imprecise nature, in database-bound applications. Two fuzzy triggers models are proposed. Firstly, a set of fuzzy rules is encapsulated into a Boolean-valued function called a rule set function, leading to the C-fuzzy trigger model. Subsequently, actions are expressed also in fuzzy terms, and the corresponding CA-fuzzy trigger model is proposed. Examples are provided to illustrate how fuzzy triggers can be applied to a real-life drive control system in an industrial installation.  1 .

We then design and implement WebSail, a real-time adaptive web search learner, with TW2 as its learning component. WebSail learns from the user's relevance feedback in real-time and helps the user to search for the desired web documents. The architecture and performance of WebSail are also discussed.

User Interface Modelling with UML The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a natural candidate  for user interface (UI) modelling since it is the standard notation  for object oriented modelling of applications. However, it is by no means  clear how to model UIs using UML. This paper presents a user interface  modelling case study using UML. This case study identifies some  aspects of UIs that cannot be modelled using UML notation, and a set  of UML constructors that may be used to model UIs. The modelling  problems indicate some weaknesses of UML for modelling UIs, while  the constructors exploited indicate some strengths. The identification  of such strengths and weaknesses can be used in the formulation of a  strategy for extending UML to provide greater support for user interface  design.

Offering a Precision-Performance Tradeoff for Aggregation Queries over Replicated Data Strict consistency of replicated data is infeasible or  not required by many distributed applications, so current  systems often permit stale replication,inwhich  cached copies of data values are allowed to become  out of date. Queries over cached data return an answer  quickly, but the stale answer may be unboundedly  imprecise. Alternatively, queries over remote  master data return a precise answer, but with potentially  poor performance. To bridge the gap between  these two extremes, we propose a new class of replication  systems called TRAPP (Tradeoff in Replication  Precision and Performance). TRAPP systems  give each user fine-grained control over the tradeoff  between precision and performance: Caches store  ranges that are guaranteed to bound the current data  values, instead of storing stale exact values. Users  supply a quantitative precision constraint along with  each query. To answer a query, TRAPP systems automatically  select a combination of locally cached  bounds and exact master data stored remotely to deliver  a bounded answer consisting of a range that is  no wider than the specified precision constraint, that  is guaranteed to contain the precise answer, and that  is computed as quickly as possible. This paper defines  the architecture of TRAPP replication systems  and covers some mechanics of caching data ranges. It  then focuses on queries with aggregation, presenting  optimization algorithms for answering queries with  precision constraints, and reporting on performance  experiments that demonstrate the fine-grained control  of the precision-performance tradeoff offered by  TRAPP systems.

Using a Room Metaphor to Ease Transitions in Groupware Many groupware systems contain gaps that hinder or block natural social interaction or that do not let people easily move between different styles of work. We believe that the adoption of a room metaphor can ease people's transitions across these gaps, allowing them to work together more naturally. Using the TeamWave Workplace system as an example, we show how particular gaps are removed. First, we ease a person's transition between single user and groupware applications by making rooms suitable for both individual and group activity. Second, people can move fluidly between asynchronous and synchronous work because room artifacts persist. People can leave messages, documents and annotations for others, or work on them together when occupying the room at the same time.

A Connectionist Approach for Learning Search-Control Heuristics for Automated Deduction Systems The central problem in automated deduction is the explosive growth of search spaces when proof length increases. In this paper, a connectionist approach for learning search-control heuristics for automated deduction systems is presented. In particular, we show how folding architecture networks, a new type of neural networks capable of solving supervised learning tasks on structured data, can be used for learning heuristics evaluation functions for algebraic (logical) expressions and how these evaluation functions can then be used to control the search process for new proof problems. Experimental results with the automated deduction system  Setheo in an algebraic domain show a considerable performance improvement. Controlled by heuristics which had been learned from simple problems in this domain the system is able to solve several problems from the same domain which had been out of reach for the original system.   1 Introduction  The goal in automated deduction (AD) is to automatically...

Ruling Agent Motion in Structured Environments . The design and development of cooperative Internet applications  based on mobile agents require appropriate modelling of both the physical  space where agents roam and the conceptual space of mobile agent interaction.

Statistical Pattern Recognition: A Review Abstract√êThe primary goal of pattern recognition is supervised or unsupervised classification. Among the various frameworks in which pattern recognition has been traditionally formulated, the statistical approach has been most intensively studied and used in practice. More recently, neural network techniques and methods imported from statistical learning theory have been receiving increasing attention. The design of a recognition system requires careful attention to the following issues: definition of pattern classes, sensing environment, pattern representation, feature extraction and selection, cluster analysis, classifier design and learning, selection of training and test samples, and performance evaluation. In spite of almost 50 years of research and development in this field, the general problem of recognizing complex patterns with arbitrary orientation, location, and scale remains unsolved. New and emerging applications, such as data mining, web searching, retrieval of multimedia data, face recognition, and cursive handwriting recognition, require robust and efficient pattern recognition techniques. The objective of this review paper is to summarize and compare some of the well-known methods used in various stages of a pattern recognition system and identify research topics and applications which are at the forefront of this exciting and challenging field.

Dynamic Function Placement for Data-intensive Cluster Computing Optimally partitioning application andfilesystem functionality within a cluster of clients and servers is a difficult problem dueto dynamic variations in application behavior, resource availability, and workload mixes. Thispaper presents A BACUS, a run-time systemthat monitors and dynamically changes function placement for applications that manipulate largedata sets. Several examples of data-intensive workloads are used to show the importance ofproper function placement and its dependence on dynamic run-time characteristics, withperformance differences frequently reaching 2-10X. We evaluate how well the ABACUSprototype adapts to run-time system behavior, including both long-term variation (e.g., filterselectivity) and short-term variation (e.g., multi-phase applications and inter-applicationresource contention). Our experiments with ABACUS indicate that it is possible to adapt inall of these situations and that the adaptation converges most quickly in those cases where theperformance impact is most significant. 1

Subsumption for XML Types . XML data is often used (validated, stored, queried, etc) with  respect to different types. Understanding the relationship between these  types can provide important information for manipulating this data. We  propose a notion of subsumption for XML to capture such relationships.  Subsumption relies on a syntactic mapping between types, and  can be used for facilitating validation and query processing. We study  the properties of subsumption, in particular the notion of the greatest  lower bound of two schemas, and show how this can be used as a guide  for selecting a storage structure. While less powerful than inclusion, subsumption  generalizes several other mechanisms for reusing types, notably  extension and refinement from XML Schema, and subtyping.  1 Introduction  XML [5] is a data format for Web applications.

Coalition Formation for Large-Scale Electronic Markets Coalition formation is a desirable behavior in a multiagent system, when a group of agents can perform a task more efficiently than any single agent can. Computational and communications complexity of traditional approaches to coalition formation, e.g., through negotiation, make them impractical for large systems. We propose an alternative, physics-motivated mechanism for coalition formation that treats agents as randomly moving, locally interacting entities. A new coalition may form when two agents encounter one another, and it may grow when a single agent encounters it. Such agent-level behavior leads to a macroscopic model that describes how the number and distribution of coalitions change with time. We increase the generality and complexity of the model by letting the agents leave coalitions with some probability. The model is expressed mathematically as a series of differential equations. These equations have steady state solutions that describe the equilibrium distribution of coa...

This logic is based on the temporal language with  `Until' interpreted over the natural numbers with expanding ALC-domains. The tableau  calculus forms an elaborated combination of Wolper's tableau calculus for propositional  linear temporal logic, the standard tableau-algorithm for ALC, and the method of quasimodels  as it has been introduced by Wolter and Zakharyaschev.

Empirical Risk Approximation: An Induction Principle for Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning algorithms are designed to extract structure from data without reference to explicit teacher information. The quality of the learned structure is determined by a cost function which guides the learning process. This paper proposes Empirical Risk Approximation as a new induction principle for unsupervised learning. The complexity of the unsupervised learning models are automatically controlled by the two conditions for learning: (i) the empirical risk of learning should uniformly converge towards the expected risk; (ii) the hypothesis class should retain a minimal variety for consistent inference. The maximal entropy principle with deterministic annealing as an efficient search strategy arises from the  Empirical Risk Approximation principle as the optimal inference strategy for large learning problems. Parameter selection of learnable data structures is demonstrated for the case of  k-means clustering. 1 What is unsupervised learning?  Learning algorithms are desi...

On splitting and Cloning Agents Embedded with cloning mechanisms, an agent can balance its own loads by discharging computing tasks to its clones when it is over-loaded. In addition, it's more reasonable to transfer the smarter, smaller clones of an agent rather than the bulky agent itself in mobile computing. In this paper, a simple BDI agent model is formally established. Using this model, the semantics of constructing new agents by inheritance and self-identifying behavior of existing agents are precisely de  ned. Four kinds of cloning mechanisms are identi  ed, the properties of each cloning mechanism and the relationships in between are studied, and some implementation issues are also discussed.

Report on the CONALD Workshop on Learning from Text and the Web Moo], organization and presentation of documents in information retrieval systems [GS, Hof], collaborative filtering [dVN], lexicon learning [GBGH], query reformulation [KK], text generation [Rad] and analysis of the statistical properties of text [MA]. In short, the state of the art in learning from text and the web is that a broad range of methods are currently being applied to many important and interesting tasks. There remain numerous open research questions, however. Broadly, the goals of the work presented at the workshop fall into two overlapping categories: (i) making textual information available in a structured format so that it can be used for complex queries and problem solving, and (ii) assisting users in finding, organizing and managing information represented in text sources. As an example of research aimed at the former goal, Muslea, Minton and Knoblock [MMK] have developed an approach to learning wrappers for semi-structured Web sources, such as restau

A Two-stage Scheme for Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition In this paper a scheme is presented for recognizing hand gestures using the output of a hand tracker which tracks a rectangular window bounding the hand region. A hierarchical scheme for dynamic hand gesture recognition is proposed based on state representation of the dominant feature trajectories using an a priori knowledge of the way in which each gesture is performed.

EventScope: Amplifying Human Knowledge and Experience via Intelligent Robotic Systems and Information Interaction The EventScope program develops publicly accessible "reality browsers" that display both archived and updating representations of remote environments derived from on-site robotic sensors. The interface encourages collaborative work within a community of users. Public exploration of real remote sites presents a variety of interface issues addressed by EventScope, including time delay, public exploration via a single robot and communication between geographically separate users from diverse backgrounds. Merging public interface with educational and contextual information extends the notion of "interface" to "remote reality library." EventScope is a NASA and private foundationfunded project based at Carnegie Mellon University. 1. Introduction  Publicly funded Earth and planetary exploration is conducted to increase knowledge of our universe. The public traditionally accesses this knowledge passively, through the media.

Dynamics in Wastewater Treatment: A Framework for Understanding Formal Constructs in Complex Technical Settings . Based on the study of unskilled work in a Danish wastewater treatment plant, the problem of formalisation of work is discussed and extended to technical processes. Five symmetrical levels of dynamics in complex technical work arrangements are proposed as a tool for understanding the limits of formalisation and for designing formal constructs in such settings. The analysis is based on concepts of heterogeneity, granularity of goals and motives, and process and structure.  Introduction  An inevitable problem in the design of CSCW systems is that work is not standing still. Rather, work settings are dynamic: routines evolve over time and unusual situations force deviations from the routine. For this reason, purely formal constructs and descriptions of work have proven inadequate when designing effective, real world CSCW systems.  Suchman and Wynn (1984) set off the debate about the role of formalism in CSCW, and their empirical studies clearly illustrated that there is more to office wo...

Monitoring Network Logs for Anomalous Activity We report on the progress of the VenusDB active-database system as driven by WatchDog, an application in network intrusion detection. The application is typical of a class of problems we coin monotonic log monitoring systems. These are systems where real-time data sources are logged to a database for transactional assurances and the database further provides services for decision support. Milestones comprise the successful layering of a Venus language executable with Oracle through the use of the Venus Abstract Machine Interface (AMI, a data abstraction interface) and Oracle's native trigger mechanism. The identification of monotonic-logging systems as an interesting application class enables us to limit coupling modes and to identify an effective layered architecture.

Topical Locality in the Web: Experiments and Observations Most web pages are linked to others with related content. This idea, combined with another that says that text in, and possibly around, HTML anchors describe the pages to which they point, is the foundation for a usable World-Wide Web. In this paper, we examine to what extent these ideas hold by empirically testing whether topical locality mirrors spatial locality of pages on the Web. In particular, we find that the likelihood of linked pages having similar textual content to be high; the similarity of sibling pages increases when the links from the parent are close together; titles, descriptions, and anchor text represent at least part of the target page; and that anchor text may be a useful discriminator among unseen child pages. These results present the foundations necessary for the success of many web systems, including search engines, focused crawlers, linkage analyzers, and intelligent web agents. 1 Introduction Most web pages are linked to others with related content...

E-DEVICE: An Extensible Active Knowledge Base System with Multiple Rule Type Support This paper describes E-DEVICE, an extensible active knowledge base system (KBS) that supports the processing of event-driven, production, and deductive rules into the same active OODB system. E-DEVICE provides the infrastructure for the smooth integration of various declarative rule types, such as production and deductive rules, into an active OODB system that supports low-level event-driven rules only by a) mapping each declarative rule into one event-driven rule, offering centralized rule selection control for correct run-time behavior and conflict resolution, and b) using complex events to map the conditions of declarative rules and monitor the database to incrementally match those conditions. E-DEVICE provides the infrastructure for easily extending the system by adding a) new rule types as subtypes of existing ones and b) transparent optimizations to the rule matching network. The resulting system is a flexible, yet efficient, KBS that gives the user the ability to express knowledge in a variety of high-level forms for advanced problem solving in data intensive applications.

EWA Learning in Bilateral Call Markets This chapter extends the EWA learning model to bilateral call market games (also known as the "sealed-bid mechanism" in two-person bargaining). In these games, a buyer and seller independently draw private values from commonly-known distributions and submit bids. If the buyer's bid is above the seller's, they trade at the midpoint of the two bids; otherwise they don't trade. We apply EWA by assuming that players have value-dependent bidding strategies, and they partially generalize experience from one value/cost condition to another in response to the incentives from nonlinear optimal bid functions. The same learning model can be applied to other market institutions where subjects economize on learning by taking into consideration similarity between past experience and a new environment while still recognizing the difference in market incentives between them. The chapter also presents a new application of EWA to a "continental divide" coordination game, and reviews 32 earlier studies comparing EWA, reinforcement, and belief learning. The application shows the advantages of a generalized adaptive model of behavior that includes elements of reinforcement, belief-based and direction learning as special cases at some cost of complexity for the benefit of generality and psychological appeal. It is a good foundation to build upon to extend our understanding of adaptive behavior in more general games and market institutions. In future work, we should investigate the similarity parameters, y and w, to better characterize their magnitude and significance in different market institutions.

Multiple Goal Q-Learning: Issues and Functions This paper addresses the concerns of agents using reinforcement learning to learn to achieve multiple simultaneous goals. It proves that an algorithm based on acting upon the maximal goal at any one time will, in many cases, not not produce the Maximal Expected Utility for the agent. The paper then examines the type of function approximator necessary for the agent's reinforcement learning system, and concludes that a bi-linear function is the best compromise between expressive power and speed of learning.

Extracting Query Modifications from Nonlinear SVMs When searching the WWW, users often desire results restricted to a particular document category. Ideally, a user would be able to filter results with a text classifier to minimize false positive results; however, current search engines allow only simple query modifications. To automate the process of generating effective query modifications, we introduce a sensitivity analysis-based method for extracting rules from nonlinear support vector machines. The proposed method allows the user to specify a desired precision while attempting to maximize the recall. Our method performs several levels of dimensionality reduction and is vastly faster than searching the combination feature space; moreover, it is very effective on real-world data.

Extending the ODMG Object Model with Time Although many temporal extensions of the relational data model have been proposed, there is no comparable amount of work in the context of object-oriented data models. Moreover, extensions to the relational model have been proposed in the framework of SQL standards, whereas no attempts have been made to extend the standard for object-oriented databases, defined by ODMG. This paper presents T ODMG, a temporal extension of the ODMG-93 standard data model. The main contributions of this work are, thus, the formalization of the ODMG standard data model and its extension with time. Another contribution of this work is the investigation, on a formal basis, of the main issues arising from the introduction of time in an object-oriented model.

Ontological Overhearing The collaboration between two intelligent agents can be greatly enhanced  if a third agent, who has some understanding of the communication between  the first two, intervenes giving appropriate information or acting helpfully  without having been explicitly involved. The behavior of this third agent, quite  common in human interaction, is called overhearing. We present an agent architecture  modeling this behavior. In particular, we focus on overhearing based on  ontological reasoning; that is, the overhearer semantically selects pieces of communication  according to his own knowledge (ontologically organized) and goals.

Improving the Quality of Labels for Self-Organising Maps Using Fine-Tuning Vector representation of legal documents is still the best way for computing classification clusters and labelling of its contents. A very special problem occurs with self organising maps: strong clusters tend to dominate neighbouring smaller clusters in terms of their weight vector structure, which influences the labels extracted from these. This unwelcome side-effect can be overcome efficiently with a dedicated fine-tuning phase at the end of the training process, in which the neighbourhood radius of the training function is set to zero. Experiments with our text collection have shown the high improvement of the quality of labelling.

Reinforcement Learning for Visual Servoing of a Mobile Robot A novel reinforcement learning algorithm is applied to a visual servoing task on a real mobile robot. There is no requirement for camera calibration, an actuator model or a knowledgeable teacher. The controller learns from a critic which gives a scalar reward. The learning algorithm handles continuously valued states and actions and can learn from good and bad experiences including data gathered while performing unrelated behaviours and from historical data. Experimental results are presented. 1 Introduction Visual servoing consists of moving some part of a robot to a desired position using visual feedback [ Hutchinson et al., 1996 ] . It is a basic building block for purposeful robot behaviours such as foraging, target pursuit and landmark based navigation. Some degree of calibration is generally required to achieve visual servoing. This calibration can be a time consuming and error prone process. In this work we show that reinforcement based learning can eliminate the ca...

Optimization and Interpretation of Rule-Based Classifiers Abstract. Machine learning methods are frequently used to create rule-based classifiers. For continuous features linguistic variables used in conditions of the rules are defined by membership functions. These linguistic variables should be optimized at the level of single rules or sets of rules. Assuming the Gaussian uncertainty of input values allows to increase the accuracy of predictions and to estimate probabilities of different classes. Detailed interpretation of relevant rules is possible using (probabilistic) confidence intervals. A real life example of such interpretation is given for personality disorders. The approach to optimization and interpretation described here is applicable to any rule-based system. 1 Introduction. In many applications rule-based classifiers are created starting from machine learning, fuzzy logic or neural network methods [1]‚Äì[3]. If the number of rules is relatively small and accuracy is sufficiently high such classifiers are an optimal choice, because the reasons for their decisions are easily verified. Crisp logical rules are desirable

The DC-tree: A Fully Dynamic Index Structure for Data Warehouses :  Many companies have recognized the strategic importance of the knowledge hidden in their large databases and have built data warehouses. Typically, updates are collected and applied to the data warehouse periodically in a batch mode, e.g., over night. Then, all derived information such as index structures has to be updated as well. The standard approach of bulk incremental updates to data warehouses has some drawbacks.First, the average runtime for a single update is small but the total runtime for the whole batch of updates may become rather large. Second, the contents of the data warehouse is not always up to date. In this paper, we introduced the DC-tree, a fully dynamic index structure for data warehouses modeled as a data cube. This new index structure is designed for applications where the above drawbacks of the bulk update approach are critical. The DC-tree is a hierarchical index structure - similar to the X-tree - exploiting the concept hierarchies typically defined for the...

Introducing a New Advantage of Crossover: Commonality-Based Selection The Commonality-Based Crossover Framework defines crossover as a two-step process: 1) preserve the maximal common schema of two parents, and 2) complete the solution with a construction heuristic. In these ‚Äúheuristic ‚Äù operators, the first step is a form of selection. This commonality-based form of selection has been isolated in GENIE. Using random parent selection and a non-elitist generational replacement scheme, GENIE does not include fitness-based selection. However, a theoretical analysis shows that ‚Äúideal ‚Äù construction heuristics in GENIE can potentially converge to optimal solutions. Experimentally, results show that the effectiveness of practical construction heuristics can be amplified by commonalitybased restarts. Overall, it is shown that the commonality hypothesis is valid--schemata common to above-average solutions are indeed above average. Since common schemata can only be identified by multi-parent operators, commonality-based selection is a unique advantage that crossover can enjoy over mutation. 1

Heterogeneous Database Integration Using Agent-Oriented Information Systems : The Department of Defense (DOD) has an extensive family of models used to simulate the mission level interaction of weapon systems. Interoperability and reuse of the underlying data files used to create simulation scenarios pose great challenges in this regard. Unlike traditional data integration methods common to federated database research, the emerging field of agent-oriented information systems (AOIS) views data as the central focus of an application while also providing an overall architectural framework for application development. We develop an AOIS solution relevant to this problem domain by combining object-oriented data modeling (OMT), a persistent programming language using a commercial objectoriented database (ObjectStore#), and an agentoriented analysis and design methodology (MaSE). Requirements from a contractor-led effort at the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) known as CERTCORT are the basis for analysis and design of our system. We implement prototypical information-layer applications to conceptually demonstrate the reusability and integration of scenarios across simulation models.

Chart of Darkness: Mapping a Large Intranet We introduce and de ne the concept of dark matter on the Web. Dark matter for a person or Web crawler consists of pages that they cannot reach and view, but which another observer can. Dark matter is important to our understanding of the Web in that the portion of the Web any of us can see depends on our viewpoint. Diffrent observers see different overlapping sections of the Web. However, no one can see all of the Web, even if they want to. We categorise the various types of dark matter that exist and how they may be discovered. Formal definitions of what constitutes lightness and darkness on the Web are formulated in terms of reachability. Our case study of dark matter within the Australian National University's intranet is reported. We estimate that 87% of the ANU intranet's information is dark to our local search service, and 37% is potentially loadable Web data unreachable to almost every Web user. Finally, we discuss some of the implications of dark matter for estimating the size of the Web and for general Web searching.

Instructable Autonomous Agents INSTRUCTABLE AUTONOMOUS AGENTS by Scott Bradley Huffman Chair: John E. Laird In contrast to current intelligent systems, which must be laboriously programmed for each task they are meant to perform, instructable agents can be taught new tasks and associated knowledge. This thesis presents a general theory of learning from tutorial instruction and its use to produce an instructable agent. Tutorial instruction is a particularly powerful form of instruction, because it allows the instructor to communicate whatever kind of knowledge a student needs at whatever point it is needed. To exploit this broad flexibility, however, a tutorable agent must support a full range of interaction with its instructor to learn a full range of knowledge. Thus, unlike most machine learning tasks, which target deep learning of a single kind of knowledge from a single kind of input, tutorability requires a breadth of learning from a broad range of instructional interactions. The theory of learning from tutorial...

Intelligent Gradient-Based Search of Incompletely Defined Design Spaces Gradient-based numerical optimization of complex engineering designs offers the promise of rapidly producing better designs. However, such methods generally assume that the objective function and constraint functions are continuous, smooth, and defined everywhere. Unfortunately, realistic simulators tend to violate these assumptions. We present a rule-based technique for intelligently computing gradients in the presence of such pathologies in the simulators, and show how this gradient computation method can be used as part of a gradient-based numerical optimization system. We tested the resulting system in the domain of conceptual design of supersonic transport aircraft, and found that using rule-based gradients can decrease the cost of design space search by one or more orders of magnitude.

CAT: the Copying Approach to Tabling The SLG-WAM is an abstract machine that can be characterized as a sharing approach to implementing tabling: The execution environments of suspended computations are interspersed in the WAM stacks. Stacks are frozen using a set of freeze registers, and the WAM trail mechanism is extended so that the suspended computations can be resumed. This technique has a reasonably small execution overhead, but it is not easy to implement on top of an existing Prolog system. It is also quite difficult to understand. We propose a new technique for the implementation of tabling: the copying approach to tabling. CAT does not impose any overhead to the execution of Prolog code and can be introduced into an existing Prolog system orthogonally. Also, CAT is easier to understand. We have implemented CAT in the XSB system by taking out SLG-WAM and adding CAT. We describe the additions needed for adopting CAT in a WAM implementation. We show a case in which CAT performs arbitrarily worse than SLG-WAM, but on the other hand we present empirical evidence that CAT is competitive and often faster than the SLG-WAM. We also briefly discuss issues related to memory management and to the scheduling.

An Efficient Boosting Algorithm for Combining Preferences We study the problem of learning to accurately rank a set of objects by combining a given collection  of ranking or preference functions. This problem of combining preferences arises in several  applications, such as that of combining the results of different search engines, or the "collaborativefiltering  " problem of ranking movies for a user based on the movie rankings provided by other  users. In this work, we begin by presenting a formal framework for this general problem. We then  describe and analyze an efficient algorithm called RankBoost for combining preferences based on  the boosting approach to machine learning. We give theoretical results describing the algorithm's  behavior both on the training data, and on new test data not seen during training. We also describe  an efficient implementation of the algorithm for a particular restricted but common case. We next  discuss two experiments we carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost. In the first experiment,  we used the algorithm to combine different web search strategies, each of which is a query  expansion for a given domain. The second experiment is a collaborative-filtering task for making  movie recommendations.

Lineage Tracing for General Data Warehouse Transformations Data warehousing systems integrate information from operational data sources into a central repository to enable analysis and mining of the integrated information. During the integration process, source data typically undergoes a series of transformations, which may vary from simple algebraic operations or aggregations to complex "data cleansing" procedures. In a warehousing environment, the data lineage problem is that of tracing warehouse data items back to the original source items from which they were derived. We formally define the lineage tracing problem in the presence of general data warehouse transformations, and we present algorithms for lineage tracing in this environment. Our tracing procedures take advantage of known structure or properties of transformations when present, but also work in the absence of such information. Our results can be used as the basis for a lineage tracing tool in a general warehousing setting, and also can guide the design of data warehouses that enable efficient lineage tracing.  1

Estimating Dependency Structure as a Hidden Variable This paper introduces a probability model, the mixture of trees that can account for sparse, dynamically changing dependence relationships. We present a family of efficient algorithms that use EM and the Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm to find the ML and MAP mixture of trees for a variety of priors, including the Dirichlet and the MDL priors.  1 INTRODUCTION  A fundamental feature of a good model is the ability to uncover and exploit independencies in the data it is presented with. For many commonly used models, such as neural nets and belief networks, the dependency structure encoded in the model is fixed, in the sense that it is not allowed to vary depending on actual values of the variables or with the current case. However, dependency structures that are conditional on values of variables abound in the world around us. Consider for example bitmaps of handwritten digits. They obviously contain many dependencies between pixels; however, the pattern of these dependencies will vary acr...

To Each and Everyone an Agent: Augmenting Web-Based Commerce with Agents Internet has evolved from an information space to a market space with thousands, potentially millions, of electronic storefronts, auctions and other commercial services. This creates great opportunities, but is not without problems. One major problem is the difficulty of finding relevant offers. Another problem is coping with the multitude of different styles of web-based user interfaces to different marketplaces. Yet another problem is how to automate routine tasks in such an environment. We present one possible solution to these problems. An agent-based market infrastructure, in which agents support all users and services, helps customers and commercial sites find matching interests, and, if desired, negotiate and close deals. The infrastructure is entirely open and decentralized. Each participant has an agent that acts in the interest of its owner. Interaction is entirely symmetric. Any participant can play any role on a market. In this paper we present an integration of such an infrastructure, SICS MarketSpace, with the web. Personal assistant agents help users in their interaction with services and are able to handle routine tasks off-line. Agent-enabled services are able to adapt to the interests of their users, even on their first visit, and are provided with a mechanism to take the first initiative (push) in a highly focused manner.

Group Task Analysis for Groupware Usability Evaluations Techniques for inspecting the usability of groupware applications have recently been proposed. These techniques focus on the mechanics of collaboration rather than the work context in which a system is used, and offer time and cost savings by not requiring actual users or fully-functional prototypes. Although these techniques are valuable, adding information about task and work context could improve the quality of inspection results. We introduce a method for analysing group tasks that can be used to add context to discount groupware evaluation techniques. Our method allows for the specification of collaborative scenarios and tasks by considering the mechanics of collaboration, levels of coupling during task performance, and variability in task execution. We describe how this type of task analysis could be used in a new inspection technique based on cognitive walkthrough.

In this paper, we examine selectivity estimation in the context of Geographic Information Systems, which manage spatial data such as points, lines, poly-lines and polygons. In particular, we focus on point and range queries over two-dimensional rectangular data. We propose several techniques based on using spatial indices, histograms, binary space partitionings (BSPs), and the novel notion of spatial skew. Our techniques carefully partition the input rectangles into subsets and approximate each partition accurately. We present a detailed experimental study comparing the proposed techniques and the best known sampling and parametric techniques. We evaluate them using synthetic as well as real-life TIGER datasets. Based on our experiments, we identify a BSP based partitioning that we call Min-Skew which consistently provides the most accurate selectivity estimates for spatial queries...

A Multimodal Approach To Term Extraction Using A Rhetorical Structure Theory Tagger And Formal Concept Analysis This paper reports on knowledge extraction using Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) and Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). The research is multimodal in two ways: (i) it uses a text tagger to identify key terms in free text, these terms are then used as indexation filters over the free text; (ii) it aims to normalise the contents of multiple text sources into a single knowledge base. The aim is semi-automated extraction of semantic content in texts derived from different sources and merging them into a single coherent knowledge base. We use RST ([7]) to automate the identification of discourse markers in multiple texts dealing with a single subject matter. Marcu ([8, 10]) has shown that RST can be used for the semiautomated mark up of natural language texts. Marcu uses discourse trees, useful to store information about the rhetorical structure, and has shown that the identification of discourse markers from prototypical texts can be automated with 88% precision ([9]). We have adapted Marcu's algorithm in our approach. Although our work draws on recent results from natural language processing, progress in that field is not the objective. The research is motivated by the analysis of texts generated by different sources, their translation to a formal knowledge representation followed by a consolidation into a single knowledge corpus. Our interest is in the analysis of this corpus to determine the reliability of information obtained from multiple agencies ([11]) and then to visually navigate this knowledge. This involves FCA ([14, 15, 17, 18, 6]) for browsing and retrieving text documents ([2, 3, 4, 1]). FCA is typically a propositional knowledge representation technique, i.e., it can only express monadic relations. Recently, Wille ([16]) has shown that FCA can be used to repres...

Social, Individual & Technological Issues for Groupware Calendar Systems Designing and deploying groupware is difficult. Groupware evaluation and design are often approached from a single perspective, with a technologically-, individually-, or socially-centered focus. A study of Groupware Calendar Systems (GCSs) highlights the need for a synthesis of these multiple perspectives to fully understand the adoption challenges these systems face. First, GCSs often replace existing calendar artifacts, which can impact users' calendaring habits and in turn influence technology adoption decisions. Second, electronic calendars have the potential to easily share contextualized information publicly over the computer network, creating opportunities for peer judgment about time allocation and raising concerns about privacy regulation. However, this situation may also support coordination by allowing others to make useful inferences about one's schedule. Third, the technology and the social environment are in a reciprocal, co-evolutionary relationship: the use context is affected by the constraints andaffordances of the technology, and the technology also co-adapts to the environment in important ways. Finally,  GCSs, despite being below the horizon of everyday notice, can affect the nature of temporal coordination beyond the expected meeting scheduling practice.

In  particular, the new paradigm is more flexible and  allows the use of any propositional algorithm, including  probabilistic algorithms, within it.

Feature Selection in Web Applications Using ROC Inflections and Power Set Pruning A basic problem of information processing is selecting enough features to ensure that events are accurately  represented for classification problems, while simultaneously minimizing storage and processing  of irrelevant or marginally important features. To address this problem, feature selection procedures  perform a search through the feature power set to find the smallest subset meeting performance requirements.  Major restrictions of existing procedures are that they typically explicitly or implicitly assume a  fixed operating point, and make limited use of the statistical structure of the feature power set. We present  a method that combines the Neyman-Pearson design procedure on finite data, with the directed set structure  of the Receiver Operating Curves on the feature subsets, to determine the maximal size of the feature  subsets that can be ranked in a given problem. The search can then be restricted to the smaller subsets, resulting  in significant reductions in computational...

Therefore, in this paper we present a framework for cooperative goal-satisfaction in large-scale environments focusing on a low complexity physics-oriented approach. The multi-agent systems with which we deal are modeled by a physics-oriented model. According to the model, MAS inherit physical properties, and therefore the evolution of the computational systems is similar to the evolution of physical systems. To enable implementation of the model, we provide a detailed algorithm to be used by a single agent within the system. The model and the algorithm are a...

Exploiting Schema Knowledge for the Integration of Heterogeneous Sources . Information sharing from multiple heterogeneous sources is a challenging issue which ranges from database to ontology areas. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach to information integration which takes into account semantic conflicts and contradictions, caused by the lack of a common shared ontology. Our goal is to provide an  integrated access to information sources, allowing a user to pose a single query and to receive a single unified answer. We propose a "semantic" approach to integration where the conceptual schema of each source is provided, adopting a common standard data model and language, and Description Logics plus clustering techniques  are exploited.  Description Logics is used to obtain a semi-automatic generation of a Common Thesaurus (to solve semantic heterogeneities and to derive a common ontology). Clustering techniques are used to build the global schema, i.e. the unified view of the data to be used for query processing.  keywords: Intelligent Informat...

Improving the Performance of High-Energy Physics Analysis through Bitmap Indices Bitmap indices are popular multi-dimensional structures for accessing read-mostly data such as data warehouse (DW) applications, decision support systems (DSS) and on-line analytical processing (OLAP). One of their main strengths is that they provide good performance characteristics for complex adhoc and an efficient combination of multiple index in one query. Considerable research work has been done in the area of finite (and low) attribute cardinalities. However, additional complexity is imposed on the design of bitmap indices for high cardinality or even non-discrete attributes, where different optimisation techniques than the ones proposed so far have to be applied. In this paper we discuss the design and implementation of bitmap indices for High-Energy Physics (HEP) analysis, where the potential search space consists of hundreds of independent dimensions. A single HEP query typically covers 10 to 100 dimensions out of the whole searchs space. In this context we evaluated two different bitmap encoding techniques, namely equality encoding and range encoding. For both methods the number of bit slices (or bitmap vectors) per attribute is a a central optimisation parameter. The paper presents some (first) results for choosing the optimal number of bit slices for multi-dimensional indices with attributes of different value distribution and query selectivity. We believe taht this discussion is not only applicable to HEP but also to DW, DSS and OLAP type problems in general.

Automatic Facial Expression Interpretation: Where Human-Computer Interaction, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Intersect this paper is to attempt to bring together people, results and questions from these three different disciplines -- HCI, AI, and Cognitive Science -- to explore the potential of building computer interfaces which understand and respond to the richness of the information conveyed in the human face. Until recently, information has been conveyed from the computer to the user mainly via the visual channel, whereas inputs from the user to the computer have been made from the keyboard and pointing devices via the user's motor channel. The recent emergence of multimodal interfaces as our everyday tools might restore a better balance between our physiology and sensory/motor skills, and impact (for the better we hope), the richness of activities we will find ourselves involved in. Given recent progress in user-interface primitives composed of gesture, speech, context and affect, it seems feasible to design environments which do not impose themselves as computer environments, but have a much more natural feeling associated with them.

Logical Structure Detection for Heterogeneous Document Classes We present a fully implemented system based on generic document knowledge for detecting the logical structure of documents for which only general layout information is assumed. In particular, we focus on detecting the reading order. Our system integrates components based on computer vision, articial intelligence, and natural language processing techniques. The prominent feature of our framework is its ability to handle documents from heterogeneous collections. The system has been evaluated on a standard collection of documents to measure the quality of the reading order detection. Experimental results for each component and the system as a whole are presented and discussed in detail. The performance of the system is promising, especially when considering the diversity of the document collection.

An Information Gathering Agent for Querying Web Search Engines Information gathering agents have attracted much attention of late. As a new application, they are attractive because the need for intelligent assistance in navigating the World Wide Web and large databases is acute. Information agents provide an open-ended and complex, yet easily accessible environment in which ideas from many areas can be integrated. We have developed an information gathering agent called SavvySearch for intelligently searching multiple search engines on the Web. SavvySearch tracks responses from existing search engines to manage resource usage and submit queries only to the most appropriate search engines. To implement SavvySearch, we adapted simple ideas from machine learning, information retrieval and planning and tested two issues in the designs: Can search engine selection knowledge be acquired to improve performance? Do users find that high quality results are being returned early within the limited parallelism provided by SavvySearch? Current results indicate ...

Yarrow: A Real-Time Client Side Meta-Search Learner In this paper we report our research on building Yarrow - an intelligent web meta-search engine. The predominant feature of Yarrow is that in contrast to the lack of adaptive learning features in existing metasearch engines, Yarrow is equipped with a practically efficient on-line learning algorithm so that it is capable of helping the user to search for the desired documents with as little feedback as possible. Currently, Yarrow can query eight of the most popular search engines and is able to perform document parsing and indexing, and learning in real-time on client side. Its architecture and performance are also discussed. 1.

Hallucinating Faces In most surveillance scenarios there is a large distance between the camera and the objects of interest in the scene. Surveillance cameras are also usually set up with wide fields of view in order to image as much of the scene as possible. The end result is that the objects in the scene normally appear very small in surveillance imagery. It is generally possible to detect and track the objects in the scene, however, for tasks such as automatic face recognition and license plate reading, resolution enhancement techniques are often needed. Although numerous resolution enhancement algorithms have been proposed in the literature, most of them are limited by the fact that they make weak, if any, assumptions about the scene. We propose an algorithm that can be used to learn a prior on the spatial distribution of the image gradient for frontal images of faces. We proceed to show how such a prior can be incorporated into a super-resolution algorithm to yield 4-8 fold improvements in resolution #...

The dissociation of the Genetic Algorithm from policy determination in XCS is noted, and the two types of Michigan classifier system are contrasted with Pittsburgh systems.

Improving the Scalability of Multi-agent Systems . There is an increasing demand for designers and developers  to construct ever larger multi-agent systems. Such systems will be composed  of hundreds or even thousands of autonomous agents. Moreover,  in open and dynamic environments, the number of agents in the system  at any one time will uctuate signicantly. To cope with these twin  issues of scalability and variable numbers, we hypothesize that multiagent  systems need to be both self-building (able to determine the most  appropriate organizational structure for the system by themselves at runtime)  and adaptive (able to change this structure as their environment  changes). To evaluate this hypothesis we have implemented such a multiagent  system and have applied it to the domain of automated trading.  Preliminary results supporting the rst part of this hypothesis are presented:  adaption and self-organization do indeed make the system better  able to cope with large numbers of agents.  1 Introduction  When designing or buildin...

A Wearable Spatial Conferencing Space Wearable computers provide constant access to computing and communications resources. In this paper we describe how the computing power of wearables can be used to provide spatialized 3D graphics and audio cues to aid communication. The result is a wearable augmented reality communication space with audio enabled avatars of the remote collaborators surrounding the user. The user can use natural head motions to attend to the remote collaborators, can communicate freely while being aware of other side conversations and can move through the communication space. In this way the conferencing space can support dozens of simultaneous users. Informal user studies suggest that wearable communication spaces may offer several advantages, both through the increase in the amount of information it is possible to access and the naturalness of the interface.  1: Introduction  One of the broad trends emerging in human-computer interaction is the increasing portability of computing and communication fac...

A Software Fault Tree Approach to Requirements Analysis of an Intrusion Detection System Requirements analysis for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) involves deriving requirements for the IDS from analysis of the intrusion domain. When the IDS is, as here, a collection of mobile agents that detect, classify, and correlate system and network activities, the derived requirements include what activities the agent software should monitor, what intrusion characteristics the agents should correlate, where the IDS agents should be placed to feasibly detect the intrusions, and what countermeasures the software should initiate. This paper describes the use of software fault trees for requirements identification and analysis in an IDS. Intrusions are divided into seven stages (following Ruiu), and a fault subtree is developed to model each of the seven stages (reconnaissance, penetration, etc.). Two examples are provided. This approach was found to support requirements evolution (as new intrusions were identified), incremental development of the IDS, and prioritization of countermeasures.

Constraints in Object-Oriented Databases Normal forms in relational database theory, like 3NF or BCNF, are dened by  means of semantic contraints. Since for these constraints sound and complete axiomatisations  exist and, additionally, for some of these constraints the implication  problem is decidable, computer aided database design is possible for relational  data models. Object-oriented database theory lacks such normal forms, partly  because neither a classication of semantic constraints nor sound and complete  axiomatisations exist.  In this work we present three classes of semantic constraints for object-oriented  data models and show that these constraints have a sound and complete axiomatisation.  Thus we prepare the grounds for normal forms in object-oriented data  models and subsequently for computer aided object-oriented database design.  1 Introduction  The theory of database design for relational data models identies a number of properties to characterise good database schemas. These properties lead then to no...

Bargaining with Deadlines This paper analyzes automated distributive negotiation where agents have firm deadlines that are private information. The agents are allowed to make and accept offers in any order in continuous time. We show that the only sequential equilibrium outcome is one where the agents wait until the first deadline, at which point that agent concedes everything to the other. This holds for pure and mixed strategies. So,    This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under CAREER Award IRI-9703122, Grant IRI-9610122, and Grant IIS-9800994.  y  This is based upon work supported by the EPSRC Award GR M07052.  interestingly, rational agents can never agree to a nontrivial split because offers signal enough weakness of bargaining power (early deadline) so that the recipient should never accept. Similarly, the offerer knows that it offered too much if the offer gets accepted: the offerer could have done better by out-waiting the opponent. In most cases, the deadline ...

Flattening an Object Algebra to Provide Performance Algebraic transformation and optimization techniques have been the method of choice in relational query execution, but applying them in OODBMS has been difficult due to the complexity of object-oriented query languages. This paper demonstrates that the problem can be simplified by mapping a complex storage model to the flat binary model implemented by Monet, a state-of-theart database kernel. We present a generic mapping scheme to flatten data models and study the case of a straightforward object-oriented model. We show how flattening enabled us to implement a full-fledged query algebra on it, using only a very limited set of simple operations. The required primitives and query execution strategies are discussed, and their performance is evaluated on the 1GB TPC-D benchmark, showing that our divide-and-conquer approach yields excellent results. 1 Introduction  During the last decade, relational database technology has grown towards industrial maturity, and the attention of the research...

Implementing Schema-theoretic Models of Animal Behavior in Robotic Systems Formal models of animal sensorimotor behavior can provide effective methods for generating robotic intelligence. In this paper we describe how schema-theoretic models of the praying mantis are implemented on a hexapod robot equipped with a real-time color vision system. The model upon which the implementation is based was developed by ethologists studying mantids. This implementation incorporates a wide range of behaviors, including obstacle avoidance, prey acquisition, predator avoidance, mating, and chantlitaxia behaviors. 1 Introduction  Ecological robotics refers to incorporating aspects of the relationship a robot maintains with its environment into its control system (i.e., its ecology) [4]. One means for developing such a control system is by exploiting models of behavior developed by ethologists or neuroscientists.

ROL2: A Real Deductive Object-Oriented Database Language . ROL is a strongly typed deductive object-oriented database  language. It integrates many important features of deductive databases  and object-oriented databases. However, it is only a structurally objectoriented  language.

A Neuro-Fuzzy Solution for Integrated Visual and Force Control In this paper the use of a B-spline neuro-fuzzy model for different tasks such as vision-based fine-positioning using uncalibrated cameras and force control is presented. It is shown that neuro-fuzzy controllers can be used not only for low-dimensional problems like force control but also for high-dimensional problems like vision-based sensorimotor control and for fusing input from different sensors. Controllers of this type can be modularly combined to solve a given assembly problem.  1 Introduction  It is well-known that general fuzzy rule descriptions of systems with a large number of input variables suffer from the problem of the "curse of dimensionality." In many realworld applications it is difficult to identify the decisive input parameters and thus to reduce the number of input variables to the minimum.

We first highlight the advantages of natural language hypertext as a summarization medium for KDD results, showing the gains that it provides over charts and tables in terms of conciseness, expressive versatility and ease of interpretation for decision makers. Second, we highlight how KDD technologies, and in particular OLAP and data mining, can implement key tasks of automated natural language data summary generation, in a more domain-independent and scalable way than the human written heuristic rule approach of previous systems.

Combinations of Modal Logics  Combining logics for modelling purposes has become a rapidly expanding enterprise that is inspired mainly by concerns about modularity and the wish to join together different kinds of information. As any interesting real world system is a complex, composite entity, decomposing its descriptive requirements (for design, verification, or maintenance purposes) into simpler, more restricted, reasoning tasks is not only appealing but is often the only plausible way forward. It would be an exaggeration to claim that we currently have a thorough understanding of `combined methods.' However, a core body of notions, questions and results has emerged for an important class of combined logics, and we are beginning to understand how this core theory behaves when it is applied outside this particular class.  In this paper we will consider the combination of modal (including temporal) logics, identifying leading edge research that we, and others, have carried out. Such combined sys

Anycasting supports dynamic selection of a server amongst a group of servers that provide equivalent content. If the selection is done well, the client will experience improved performance.

A multi-agent system for advising and monitoring students navigating instructional Web sites A growing community of teachers, at all levels of the educational system, provides course material in the form of hypertext/multimedia documents. In most cases this is done by creating a course Web site. This paper explores the issues related to the design of software  systems that aid teachers in monitoring how students use their sites and proactively advise students navigating the sites. In connection to these functions two important topics in current applications of technology to education are discussed. Firstly the definition of a set of criteria allowing the evaluation of the appropriateness of multi-media and hypertext technologies vis vis to classic course support  material and in particular textbooks. Secondly the issue of the utility and acceptability of proactive user interfaces such as interface agents or personal assistant agents. A multi agent system capable of advising and monitoring students navigating instructional Web sites is introduced and it is used as a basis for discussion of the above two topics. The system generates and uses a set of indicators evaluating how much use is made of hypertext and multimedia tools as well as indicators of usefulness and cognitive support of the proactive user interface.

A Theory of Term Weighting Based on Exploratory Data Analysis Techniques of exploratory data analysis are used to study the weight of evidence that the occurrence of a query term provides in support of the hypothesis that a document is relevant to an information need. In particular, the relationship between the document frequency and the weight of evidence is investigated. A correlation between document frequency normalized by collection size and the mutual information between relevance and term occurrence is uncovered. This correlation is found to be robust across a variety of query sets and document collections. Based on this relationship, a theoretical explanation of the efficacy of inverse document frequency for term weighting is developed which differs in both style and content from theories previously put forth. The theory predicts that a "flattening" of idf at both low and high frequency should result in improved retrieval performance. This altered idf formulation is tested on all TREC query sets.

His theory has been challenged from various directions, and recent experiments have confirmed Vygotsky's belief in the essential role of social interaction and teaching as a scaffolding mechanism which is important for the child in order to reach higher levels of competence and control based on current skills. Hereby concepts are not taught directly but through social interaction, the child's experiences are re-arranged, a shared understanding develops between the child and its interaction partner.

Routing Documents According to Style Most research on automated text categorization has focused on determining the topic of a given text. While topic is generally the main characteristic of an information need, there are other characteristics that are useful for information retrieval. In this paper we consider the problem of text categorization according to style. For example, in searching the web, we may wish to automatically determine if a given page is promotional or informative, was written by a native English speaker or not, and so on. Learning to determine the style of a document is a dual to that of determining its topic, in that those document features which capture the style of a document are precisely those which are independent of its topic. We here define the features of a document to be the frequencies of each of a set of function words and parts-of-speech triples. We then use machine learning techniques to classify documents.

Boosting the Margin: A New Explanation for the Effectiveness of Voting Methods Abstract. One of the surprising recurring phenomena observed in experiments with boosting is that the test error of the generated hypothesis usually does not increase as its size becomes very large, and often is observed to decrease even after the training error reaches zero. In this paper, we show that this phenomenon is related to the distribution of margins of the training examples with respect to the generated voting classification rule, where the margin of an example is simply the difference between the number of correct votes and the maximum number of votes received by any incorrect label. We show that techniques used in the analysis of Vapnik‚Äôs support vector classifiers and of neural networks with small weights can be applied to voting methods to relate the margin distribution to the test error. We also show theoretically and experimentally that boosting is especially effective at increasing the margins of the training examples. Finally, we compare our explanation to those based on the bias-variance decomposition. 1

Optimization and Global Minimization Methods Suitable for Neural Networks Neural networks are usually trained using local, gradient-based procedures. Such methods frequently find suboptimal solutions being trapped in local minima. Optimization of neural structures and global minimization methods applied to network cost functions have strong influence on all aspects of network performance. Recently genetic algorithms are frequently combined with neural methods to select best architectures and avoid drawbacks of local minimization methods. Many other global minimization methods are suitable for that purpose, although they are used rather rarely in this context. This paper provides a survey of such global methods, including some aspects of genetic algorithms.

The proposed technique mainly benefits from the motion vector properties of zonal based algorithms, such as the Advanced Predictive Diamond Zonal Search (APDZS) and the Predictive Motion Vector Field Adaptive Search Technique (PMVFAST), multihypothesis motion compensation, but also an additional motion classification phase where, depending on the motion of a pixel, additional spatial and temporal information is also considered to further improve performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate the efficacy of these algorithms, especially when compared to standard deinterlacing techniques such as the line doubling and line averaging algorithms.

Analysis and Design of Multiagent Systems Using Hybrid Coordination Media Over the last few years, two advances in agent-oriented  software engineering have had a significant impact. The first is  the identification of interaction and coordination as the central  focus of multiagent systems design and the second is the   realization that the multiagent organization is distinct from the  individual agents that populate the system. Also, the evolution  of new, more powerful hybrid coordination models, which  combine data-centered and control-centered coordination  approaches, have given us the capability to model and  implement the rules that govern organizations independently   from the individual agents in the system. This paper  investigates how to combine the power of these hybrid  coordination capabilities with the concept of organizational   rules using traditional conversation-based approaches to  designing multiagent systems.   1.

Multiple-Agent Probabilistic Pursuit-Evasion Games In this paper we develop a probabilistic framework for pursuit-evasion games. We propose a "greedy" policy to control a swarm of autonomous agents in the pursuit of one or several evaders. At each instant of time this policy directs the pursuers to the locations that maximize the probability of finding an evader at that particular time instant. It is shown that, under mild assumptions, this policy guarantees that an evader is found in finite time and that the expected time needed to find the evader is also finite. Simulations are included to illustrate the results. 1 Introduction  This paper addresses the problem of controlling a swarm of autonomous agents in the pursuit of one or several evaders. To this effect we develop a probabilistic framework for pursuit-evasion games involving multiple agents. The problem is nondeterministic because the motions of the pursuers/evaders and the devices they use to sense their surroundings require probabilistic models. It is also assumed that when ...

Let's Browse: A Collaborative Browsing Agent Web browsing, like most of today's desktop applications, is usually a solitary activity. Other forms of media, such as watching television, are often done by groups of people, such as families or friends. What would it be like to do collaborative Web browsing? Could the computer provide assistance to group browsing by trying to help find mutual interests among the participants? Let's Browse is an experiment in building an agent to assist a group of people in browsing, by suggesting new material likely to be of common interest. It is built as an extension to the single user Web browsing agent Letizia.

Typechecking for XML Transformers We study the typechecking problem for XML transformers: given an XML transformation program and a DTD for the input XML documents, check whether every result of the program conforms to a specified output DTD. We model XML transformers using a novel device called a k- pebble transducer, that can express most queries without data-value joins in XML-QL, XSLT, and other XML query languages. Types are modeled by regular tree languages, a robust extension of DTDs. The main result of the paper is that typechecking for k-pebble transducers is decidable. Consequently, typechecking can be performed for a broad range of XML transformation languages, including XMLQL and a fragment of XSLT.  1. INTRODUCTION  Traditionally, database query languages have focused on data retrieval, with complex data transformations left to applications. The new XML data exchange standard for the Web, and emerging applications requiring data wrapping and integration, have shifted the focus towards data transformations....

BISMARC: A Biologically Inspired System for Map-based Autonomous Rover Control As the complexity of the missions to planetary surfaces increases, so too does the need for autonomous rover systems. This need is complicated by the power, mass and computer storage restrictions on such systems (Miller, 1992). To address these problems, we have recently developed a system called BISMARC (Biologically Inspired System for Map-based Autonomous Rover Control) for planetary missions involving multiple small, lightweight surface rovers (Huntsberger, 1997). BISMARC is capable of cooperative planetary surface retrieval operations such as a multiple cache recovery mission to Mars. The system employs autonomous navigation techniques, behavior-based control for surface retrieval operations, and an action selection mechanism based on a modified form of free flow hierarchy (Rosenblatt and Payton, 1989). This paper primarily describes the navigation and map-mapping subsystems of BISMARC. They are inspired by some recent studies of London taxi drivers indicating that the right hippo...

Contract-Net-Based Learning in a User-Adaptive Interface Agency . This paper describes a multi-agent learning approach to adaptation to users' preferences realized by an interface agency. Using a contract-net-based negotiation technique, agents as contractors as well as managers negotiate with each other to pursue the overall goal of dynamic user adaptation. By learning from indirect user feedback, the adjustment of internal credit vectors and the assignment of contractors that gained maximal credit with respect to the user's current preferences, the preceding session, and current situational circumstances can be realized. In this way, user adaptation is achieved without accumulating explicit user models but by the use of implicit, distributed user models. 1 Introduction Interface agents are computer programs that enhance the human-computer interaction by mediating a relationship between technical systems and users [Lau90]. On the one hand, they provide assistance to users by acting on his/her behalf and automating his/her actions [Nor94...

On the Correspondence between Neural Folding Architectures and Tree Automata The folding architecture together with adequate supervised training algorithms is a special recurrent neural network model designed to solve inductive inference tasks on structured domains. Recently, the generic architecture has been proven as a universal approximator of mappings from rooted labeled ordered trees to real vector spaces. In this article we explore formal correspondences to the automata (language) theory in order to characterize the computational power (representational capabilities) of different instances of the generic folding architecture. As the main result we prove that simple instances of the folding architecture have the computational power of at least the class of deterministic bottom-up tree automata. It is shown how architectural constraints like the number of layers, the type of the activation functions (first-order vs. higher-order) and the transfer functions (threshold vs. sigmoid) influence the representational capabilities. All proofs are carried out in a c...

On Computational Representations of Herbrand Models . Finding computationally valuable representations of models of predicate logic formulas is an important issue in the field of automated theorem proving, e.g. for automated model building or semantic resolution. In this article we treat the problem of representing single models independently of building them and discuss the power of different mechanisms for this purpose. We start with investigating context-free languages for representing single Herbrand models. We show their computational feasibility and prove their expressive power to be exactly the finite models. We show an equivalence with "ground atoms and ground equations" concluding equal expressive power. Finally we indicate how various other well known techniques could be used for representing essentially infinite models (i.e. models of not finitely controllable formulas), thus motivating our interest in relating model properties with syntactical properties of corresponding Herbrand models and in investigating connections betwe...

Integrating Spatial Information And Image Analysis - One Plus One Makes Ten Photogrammetry and remote sensing have proven their efficiency for spatial data collection in many ways. Interactive mapping at digital workstations is performed by skilled operators, which guarantees excellent quality in particular of the geometric data. In this way, worldwide acquisition of a large number of national GIS databases has been supported and still a lot of production effort is devoted to this task. In the field of image analysis, it has become evident that algorithms for scene interpretation and 3D reconstruction of topographic objects, which rely on a single data source, cannot function efficiently. Research in two directions promises to be more successful. Multiple, largely complementary, sensor data like range data from laser scanners, SAR and panchromatic or multi-/hyper-spectral aerial images have been used to achieve robustness and better performance in image analysis.

Naive Bayes for Regression Abstract. Despite its simplicity, the naive Bayes learning scheme performs well on most classification tasks, and is often significantly more accurate than more sophisticated methods. Although the probability estimates that it produces can be inaccurate, it often assigns maximum probability to the correct class. This suggests that its good performance might be restricted to situations where the output is categorical. It is therefore interesting to see how it performs in domains where the predicted value is numeric, because in this case, predictions are more sensitive to inaccurate probability estimates. This paper shows how to apply the naive Bayes methodology to numeric prediction (i.e., regression) tasks by modeling the probability distribution of the target value with kernel density estimators, and compares it to linear regression, locally weighted linear regression, and a method that produces ‚Äúmodel trees‚Äù‚Äîdecision trees with linear regression functions at the leaves. Although we exhibit an artificial dataset for which naive Bayes is the method of choice, on real-world datasets it is almost uniformly worse than locally weighted linear regression and model trees. The comparison with linear regression depends on the error measure: for one measure naive Bayes performs similarly, while for another it is worse. We also show that standard naive Bayes applied to regression problems by discretizing the target value performs similarly badly. We then present empirical evidence that isolates naive Bayes ‚Äô independence assumption as the culprit for its poor performance in the regression setting. These results indicate that the simplistic statistical assumption that naive Bayes makes is indeed more restrictive for regression than for classification.

Paradigma: Agent Implementation through Jini One of the key problems of recent years has been the divide between theoretical work in agent-based systems and its practical complement which have, to a large extent, developed along different paths. The Paradigma implementation framework has been designed with the aim of narrowing this gap. It relies on an extensive formal agent framework implemented using recent advances in Java technology. Specifically, Paradigma uses Jini connectivity technology to enable the creation of on-line communities in support of the development of agent-based systems.  1 Introduction  In a networked environment that is highly interconnected, interdependent and heterogeneous, we are faced with an explosion of information and available services that are increasingly hard to manage. Agent-based systems can provide solutions to these problems as a consequence of their dynamics of social interaction; communication and cooperation can be used to effectively model problem domains through the interaction of agent...

Applying Parallelism to Improve Genetic Algorithm-based Design Optimization Introduction  The abundance of powerful workstations makes course-grained parallelization an obvious enhancement to many optimization techniques, including genetic algorithms [Gol89, DM97]. While initial modifications have been made to GADO (Genetic Algorithm for Design Optimization [Ras98, RHG97]), such changes have not been carefully analyzed for potential impacts on quality. More generally, parallelization has the potential to improve GA performance through the use of alternative models of computation. Parallelism can certainly reduce the total elapsed clock-time for a solution, but as a change in model of computation (either real or simulated) , it can change the number of simulator calls and even make new solutions achievable. The effects of parallelization on GADO were investigated during my summer internship at the Center for Computational Design. 2 Objectives  Since a straightforward parallelized implementation already existed, my first tasks were to ana

Using the CONDENSATION Algorithm for Robust, Vision-based Mobile Robot Localization To navigate reliably in indoor environments, a mobile robot must know where it is. This includes both the ability of globally localizing the robot from scratch, as well as tracking the robot's position once its location is known. Vision has long been advertised as providing a solution to these problems, but we still lack efficient solutions in unmodified environments. Many existing approaches require modification of the environment to function properly, and those that work within unmodified environments seldomly address the problem of global localization.  In this paper we present a novel, vision-based localization method based on the CONDENSATION algorithm [17, 18], a Bayesian filtering method that uses a samplingbased density representation. We show how the CONDEN- SATION algorithm can be used in a novel way to track the position of the camera platform rather than tracking an object in the scene. In addition, it can also be used to globally localize the camera platform, given a visua...

An Intelligent Agent Framework In VRML Worlds actions, e.g. move to next room, are received by it and consequently send to the EAC. Finally, the abstract action arrives at the Virtual Reality Management Unit that specifies in detail the received actions. It provides specific values concerning the orientation and position of the avatar, e.g. it specifies the coordinates, orientation and path so that it can successfully move to the next room, and sends them as commands to the Virtual Reality World Browser. The browser executes the command by altering the virtual environment appropriately. When changes have been performed the AEC unit notifies the logical core that the action has been successfully executed and the logical core goes on by updating its internal and external state. Consequently, the agent looks around into the virtual space, gathers any additional information and decides the next step it should take to satisfy its goals.

Model-Free Least-Squares Policy Iteration We propose a new approach to reinforcement learning which combines least squares function approximation with policy iteration. Our method is model-free and completely off policy. We are motivated by the least squares temporal difference learning algorithm (LSTD), which is known for its efficient use of sample experiences compared to pure temporal difference algorithms. LSTD is ideal for prediction problems, however it heretofore has not had a straightforward application to control problems. Moreover, approximations learned by LSTD are strongly influenced by the visitation distribution over states. Our new algorithm, Least-Squares Policy Iteration (LSPI) addresses these issues. The result is an off-policy method which can use (or reuse) data collected from any source. We test LSPI on several problems, including a bicycle simulator in which it learns to guide the bicycle to a goal efficiently by merely observing a relatively small number of completely random trials.

The BASIS System: a Benchmarking Approach for Spatial Index Structures This paper describes the design of the BASIS prototype system, which is currently under implementation. BASIS stands for Benchmarking Approach for Spatial Index Structures. It is a prototype system aiming at performance evaluation of spatial access methods and query processing strategies, under different data sets, various query types, and different workloads. BASIS is based on a modular architecture, composed of a simple storage manager, a query processor, and a set of algorithmic techniques to facilitate benchmarking. The main objective of BASIS is twofold: (i) to provide a benchmarking environment for spatial access methods and related query evaluation techniques, and (ii) to allow comparative studies of spatial access methods in different cases but under a common framework. We currently extend it to support the fundamental features of spatiotemporal data management and access methods.

ToX - The Toronto XML Engine Abstract. We present ToX ‚Äì the Toronto XML Engine ‚Äì a repository for XML data and metadata, which supports real and virtual XML documents. Real documents are stored as files or mapped into relational or object databases, depending on their structuredness; indices are defined according to the storage method used. Virtual documents can be remote documents, defined as arbitrary WebOQL queries, or views, defined as queries over documents registered in the system. The system catalog contains metadata for the documents, especially their schemata, used for query processing and optimization. Queries can range over both the catalog and the documents, and multiple query languages are supported. In this paper we describe the architecture and main of ToX; we present our indexing and storage strategies, including two novel techniques; and we discuss our query processing strategy.

Logic-Based Subsumption Architecture In this paper we describe a logic-based AI architecture based on Brooks'  Subsumption Architecture. We axiomatize each of the layers of control in  his system separately and use independent theorem provers to derive each  layer's output actions given its inputs. We implement the subsumption  of lower layers by higher layers using circumscription. We give formal  semantics to our approach.  1 Introduction  In [?], Brooks proposed a reactive architecture embodying an approach to robot control different on various counts from traditional approaches. He decomposed the problem into layers corresponding to levels of behavior, rather than according to a sequential, functional form. Within this setting he introduced the idea of subsumption, that is, that more complex layers could not only depend on lower, more reactive layers, but could also influence their behavior. The resulting architecture was one that could service simultaneously multiple, potentially conflicting goals in a reactive fashi...

REFEREE: An open framework for practical testing of recommender systems using ResearchIndex Automated recommendation (e.g., personalized product recommendation on an ecommerce web site) is an increasingly valuable service associated with many databases--typically online retail catalogs and web logs. Currently, a major obstacle for evaluating recommendation algorithms is the lack of any standard, public, real-world testbed appropriate for the task. In an attempt to fill this gap, we have created REFEREE, a framework for building recommender systems using ResearchIndex--a huge online digital library of computer science research papers--so that anyone in the research community can develop, deploy, and evaluate recommender systems relatively easily and quickly. Research Index is in many ways ideal for evaluating recommender systems, especially so-called hybrid recommenders that combine information filtering and collaborative filtering techniques. The documents in the database are associated with a wealth of content information (author, title, abstract, full text) and collaborative information (user behaviors), as well as linkage information via the citation structure. Our framework supports more realistic evaluation metrics that assess user buy-in directly, rather than resorting to offline metrics like prediction accuracy that may have little to do with end user utility. The sheer scale of ResearchIndex (over 500,000 documents with thousands of user accesses per hour) will force algorithm designers to make real-world trade-offs that consider performance, not just accuracy. We present our own tradeoff decisions in building an example hybrid recommender called PD-Live. The algorithm uses content-based similarity information to select a set of documents from which to recommend, and collaborative information to rank the documents. PD-Live performs reasonably well compared to other recommenders in ResearchIndex.

Performance Analysis of Mobile Agents for Filtering Data Streams on Wireless Networks Wireless networks are an ideal environment for mobile agents, since their mobility allows them to move across an unreliable link to reside on a wired host, next to or closer to the resources that they need to use. Furthermore, clientspecific data transformations can be moved across the wireless link and run on a wired gateway server, reducing bandwidth demands. In this paper we examine the tradeoffs faced when deciding whether to use mobile agents in a datafiltering application where numerous wireless clients filter information from a large data stream arriving across the wired network. We develop an analytical model and use parameters from filtering experiments conducted during a U.S. Navy Fleet Battle Experiment (FBE) to explore the model's implications.  1.

Latent Semantic Indexing: A Probabilistic Analysis Latent semantic indexing (LSI) is an information retrieval technique based on the spectral analysis of the term-document matrix, whose empirical success had heretofore been without rigorous prediction and explanation. We prove that, under certain conditions, LSI does succeed in capturing the underlying semantics of the corpus and achieves improved retrieval performance. We also propose the technique of random projection as a way of speeding up LSI. We complement our theorems with encouraging experimental results. We also argue that our results may be viewed in a more general framework, as a theoretical basis for the use of spectral methods in a wider class of applications such as collaborative filtering.

The Eel Programming Language and Internal Concurrency in Logic Agents This paper describes work done on creating the logic programming language  Eel. The language is designed for implementing agents with a behaviour based,  concurrent internal architecture. The paper also suggests a new such architecture  which improves on the ones currently available. It gives examples of how  parts of that architecture are implemented in Eel and comments that the Agent  Oriented Programming paradigm currently contains two different metaphors for  concurrency.  Eel's event based approach to process communication and process initiation  introduces an explicit representation of state to a logic program. A new declarative  approach to object states is demonstrated as a part of the object oriented implementation  of the suggested agent architecture.

Multi-Layer Incremental Induction . This paper describes a multi-layer incremental induction algorithm, MLII, which is linked to an existing nonincremental induction algorithm to learn incrementally from noisy data. MLII makes use of three operations: data partitioning, generalization and reduction. Generalization can either learn a set of rules from a (sub)set of examples, or refine a previous set of rules. The latter is achieved through a redescription operation called reduction: from a set of examples and a set of rules, we derive a new set of examples describing the behaviour of the rule set. New rules are extracted from these behavioral examples, and these rules can be seen as meta-rules, as they control previous rules in order to improve their predictive accuracy. Experimental results show that MLII achieves significant improvement on the existing nonincremental algorithm HCV used for experiments in this paper, in terms of rule accuracy. 1 Introduction  Existing machine learning algorithms can be generally distin...

Super Logic Programs Recently, considerable interest and research e#ort has been given to the problem of finding a suitable extension of the logic programming paradigm beyond the class of normal logic programs. In order to demonstrate that a class of programs can be justifiably called an extension of logic programs one should be able to argue that:  .  the proposed syntax of such programs resembles the syntax of logic programs but it applies to a significantly broader class of programs;  .  the proposed semantics of such programs constitutes an intuitively natural extension of the semantics of normal logic programs;  .  there exists a reasonably simple procedural mechanism allowing, at least in principle, to compute the semantics;  .  the proposed class of programs and their semantics is a special case of a more general non-monotonic formalism which clearly links it to other well-established non-monotonic formalisms. In this paper we propose a specific class of extended logic programs which will be (modestly) called super logic programs or just super-programs. We will argue that the class of super-programs satisfies all of the above conditions, and, in addition, is su#ciently flexible to allow various application-dependent extensions and modifications. We also provide a brief description of a Prolog implementation of a query-answering interpreter for the class of super-programs which is available via FTP and WWW.

Indexing Moving Points We propose three indexing schemes for storing a set S of N points in the plane, each moving  along a linear trajectory, so that a query of the following form can be answered quickly: Given  a rectangle R and a real value t q , report all K points of S that lie inside R at time t q . We  first present an indexing structure that, for any given constant " ? 0, uses O(N=B) disk blocks,  where B is the block size, and answers a query in O((N=B)  1=2+"  + K=B) I/Os. It can also  report all the points of S that lie inside R during a given time interval. A point can be inserted  or deleted, or the trajectory of a point can be changed, in O(log  2  B N) I/Os. Next, we present a  general approach that improves the query time if the queries arrive in chronological order, by  allowing the index to evolve over time. We obtain a tradeoff between the query time and the  number of times the index needs to be updated as the points move. We also describe an indexing  scheme in which the number of I/Os required to answer a query depends monotonically on the  difference between t q and the current time. Finally, we develop an efficient indexing scheme to  answer approximate nearest-neighbor queries among moving points.

Multi-Layer Methods and the Optimal Optimizer Multi-Layer Methods are methods that act on several layers simultaneously. Examples of multi-layer methods are found in multi-agent systems (global and per-agent behavior), in learning (e.g. boosting, bias tuning), in self-adaptive methods (such as evolution strategies), in hybrid approaches, and in optimization (e.g. multiple runs, result pooling). We give a formal definition of what a multi-layer method is. We discuss the relationship with the no free lunch theorem, to show that such a thing as the optimal optimizer exists, and how multi-layer methods can be used to approximate it.

Scalable Trigger Processing +  Current database trigger systems have extremely limited scalability. This paper proposes a way to develop a truly scalable trigger system. Scalability to large numbers of triggers is achieved with a trigger cache to use main memory effectively, and a memory-conserving selection predicate index based on the use of unique expression formats called expression signatures. A key observation is that if a very large number of triggers are created, many will have the same structure, except for the appearance of different constant values. When a trigger is created, tuples are added to special relations created for expression signatures to hold the trigger's constants. These tables can be augmented with a database index or main-memory index structure to serve as a predicate index. The design presented also uses a number of types of concurrency to achieve scalability, including token (tuple)-level, condition-level, rule action-level, and datalevel concurrency.  1.

Robust Entropy Estimation Strategies Based on Edge Weighted Random Graphs (with corrections) In this paper we treat the problem of robust entropy estimation given a multidimensional random sample from an unknown distribution. In particular, we consider estimation of the Renyi entropy of fractional order which is insensitive to outliers, e.g. high variance contaminating distributions, using the k-point minimal spanning tree (kMST) . A greedy algorithm for approximating the NP-hard problem of computing the k-minimal spanning tree is given which is a generalization of the potential function partitioning method of Ravi etal.  1  The basis for our approach is an asymptotic theorem establishing that the log of the overall length or weight of the greedy approximation is a strongly consistent estimator of the Renyi entropy. Quantitative robustness of the estimator to outliers is established using Hampel's method of inuence functions.  2  The structure of the inuence function indicates that the k-MST is a natural extension of the one dimensional -trimmed mean for multi-dimensional...

A growing number of applications in need of dependable connections with specific requirements to bandwidth and delay have started using the internet (which only provides best effort transport) as their base communication service. In this paper we adopt the 1:1 protection scheme and incorporate it as part of a routing system applicable for internet infrastructures. 100% capacity redundancy is no longer required. A distributed stochastic path finding (routing) algorithm based on Rubinstein's Cross Entropy method for combinatorial optimisation is presented. Early results from Monte Carlo simulations indeed indicate that the algorithm is capable of finding pairs of independent primary and backup paths satisfying specific bandwidth a constraints.

Policy Controlled Mobility The mobility of software components seems an interesting solution for the deployment of web services and applications in the Internet global infrastructure and also in mobile ad-hoc networks. The network infrastructure already supports several forms of code mobility to make possible to dynamically reconfigure bindings between code fragments and locations where they are to be executed. However, more work is still to be done to facilitate the specification and the enforcement of the mobility behaviour of software components. The traditional approach to embed the migration strategy into the component at design time can not suit the dynamicity of the new network scenarios. Mobile components should instead be enhanced with the possibility to adapt their mobility behaviour to evolving application and environment conditions and to react to unforeseen events. To reach this goal, the paper proposes the adoption of policy based systems to abstract away the specification of migration strategies from the component code. This approach permits to change the mobility behaviour of components without intervention on the component code. We have experienced the dynamicity and flexibility of the proposed approach in the framework obtained by integrating a policy-based management system in a mobile agent environment.

User Behavior Analysis of Location Aware Search Engine Rapid growth of internet access from mobile users puts much importance on location specific information on the web. An unique web service called Mobile Info Search (MIS) from NTT Laboratories gathers the information and provide location aware search facilities. We performed association rule mining and sequence pattern mining against the access log which was accumulated at the MIS site in order to get some insight into the behavior of mobile users regarding the spatial information on the web. Detail web log mining process and the rules we derived are reported in this paper.

Bayesian Representations and Learning Mechanisms for Content-Based Image Retrieval We have previously introduced a Bayesian framework for content-based image retrieval (CBIR) that relies on a generative model for feature representation based on embedded mixtures. This is a truly generic image representation that can jointly model color and texture and has been shown to perform well across a broad spectrum of image databases. In this paper, we expand the Bayesian framework along two directions.  First, we show that the formulation of CBIR as a problem of Bayesian inference leads to a natural criteria for evaluating local image similarity without requiring any image segmentation. This allows the practical implementation of retrieval systems where users can provide image regions, or objects, as queries. Region-based queries are significantly less ambiguous than queries based on entire images leading to significant improvements in retrieval precision.  Second, we present a Bayesian learning algorithm that relies on belief propagation to integrate feedback provided by the...

An Ounce of Prevention is Worth A Pound of Cure: Formal Verification for Consistent Database Evolution Consistency of a database is as an important property that must be preserved at all times. In most OODB systems today, application code can directly access and alter both the data as well as the structure of the database. As a consequence application code can potentially violate the integrity of the database, in terms of the invariants of the data model, the user-specified application constraints, and even the referential integrity of the objects themselves. A common form of consistency management in most databases today is to encode constraints at the system level (e.g., foreign keys), or at the trigger based level (e.g., user constraints) and to perform transaction rollback on discovery of any violation of these constraints. However, for programs that alter the structure as well as the objects in a database, such as an extensible schema evolution program, roll-backs are expensive and add to the already astronomical cost of doing schema evolution. In this paper, pre-execution ...

Specification of Heterogeneous Agent Architectures . Agent-based software applications need to incorporate agents having  heterogeneous architectures in order for each agent to optimally perform its  task. HEMASL is a simple meta-language used to specify intelligent agents and  multi-agent systems when different and heterogeneous agent architectures must  be used. HEMASL specifications are based on an agent model that abstracts several  existing agent architectures. The paper describes some of the features of the  language, presents examples of its use and outlines its operational semantics. We  argue that adding HEMASL to CaseLP, a specification and prototyping environment  for MAS, can enhance its flexibility and usability.  1 Introduction  Intelligent agents and multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly being acknowledged as the "new" modelling techniques to be used to engineer complex and distributed software applications [17, 9].

Multiagent Learning Using a Variable Learning Rate Learning to act in a multiagent environment is a difficult problem since the normal definition of an optimal policy no longer applies. The optimal policy at any moment depends on the policies of the other agents. This creates a situation of learning a moving target. Previous learning algorithms have one of two shortcomings depending on their approach. They either converge to a policy that may not be optimal against the specific opponents ‚Äô policies, or they may not converge at all. In this article we examine this learning problem in the framework of stochastic games. We look at a number of previous learning algorithms showing how they fail at one of the above criteria. We then contribute a new reinforcement learning technique using a variable learning rate to overcome these shortcomings. Specifically, we introduce the WoLF principle, ‚ÄúWin or Learn Fast, ‚Äù for varying the learning rate. We examine this technique theoretically, proving convergence in self-play on a restricted class of iterated matrix games. We also present empirical results on a variety of more general stochastic games, in situations of self-play and otherwise, demonstrating the wide applicability of this method.

Query Optimization for Semistructured Data using Path Constraints in a Deterministic Data Model . Path constraints have been studied for semistructured data  modeled as a rooted edge-labeled directed graph [4, 11--13]. In this model,  the implication problems associated with many natural path constraints  are undecidable [11, 13]. A variant of the graph model, called the deterministic  data model , was recently proposed in [10]. In this model, data is  represented as a graph with deterministic edge relations, i.e., the edges  emanating from any node in the graph have distinct labels. This model is  more appropriate for representing, e.g., ACeDB [27] databases and Web  sites. This paper investigates path constraints for the deterministic data  model. It demonstrates the application of path constraints to, among  others, query optimization. Three classes of path constraints are considered:  the language Pc introduced in [11], an extension of Pc , denoted by  P  w  c , by including wildcards in path expressions, and a generalization of  P  w  c , denoted by P  c , by representing pa...

Comparing Evolutionary Programs and Evolutionary Pattern Search Algorithms: A Drug Docking Application Evolutionary programs (EPs) and evolutionary pattern search algorithms (EPSAs) are two general classes of evolutionary methods for optimizing on continuous domains. The relative performance of these methods has been evaluated on standard global optimization test functions, and these results suggest that EPSAs more robustly converge to nearoptimal solutions than EPs. In this paper we evaluate the relative performance of EPSAs and EPs on a real-world application: flexible ligand binding in the Autodock docking software. We compare the performance of these methods on a suite of docking test problems. Our results confirm that EPSAs and EPs have comparable performance, and they suggest that EPSAs may be more robust on larger, more complex problems. 1 Introduction  Evolutionary programs (EPs) and evolutionary pattern search algorithms (EPSAs) are two classes of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) that have been specifically developed for solving problems of the form min  x2R  n  f(x): In particula...

Making Use of Population Information in Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks This paper is concerned with the simultaneous evolution of artificial neural network (ANN) architectures and weights. The current practice in evolving ANN's is to choose the best ANN in the last generation as the final result. This paper proposes a different approach to form the final result by combining all the individuals in the last generation in order to make best use of all the information contained in the whole population. This approach regards a population of ANN's as an ensemble and uses a combination method to integrate them. Although there has been some work on integrating ANN modules [2], [3], little has been done in evolutionary learning to make best use of its population information. Four linear combination methods have been investigated in this paper to illustrate our ideas. Three real-world data sets have been used in our experimental studies, which show that the recursive least-square (RLS) algorithm always produces an integrated system that outperforms the best individual. The results confirm that a population contains more information than a single individual. Evolutionary learning should exploit such information to improve generalization of learned systems.

Organisational Rules as an Abstraction for the Analysis and Design of Multi-Agent Systems Multi-agent systems... In this paper we introduce three additional organisational concepts - organisational rules, organisational structures, and organisational patterns - and discuss why we believe they are necessary for the complete specification of computational organisations. In particular, we focus on the concept of organisational rules and introduce a formalism, based on temporal logic, to specify them. This formalism is then used to drive the definition of the organisational structure and the identification of the organisational patterns. Finally, the paper sketches some guidelines for a methodology for agent-oriented systems based on our expanded set of organisational abstractions.

An Agent-Based Approach to the Construction of Floristic Digital Libraries This paper describes an agent-assisted approach to the construction of floristic digital libraries, which consist of very large botanical data repositories and related services. We propose an environment, termed Chrysalis, in which authors of plant morphologic descriptions can enter data into a digital library via a web-based editor. An agent that runs concurrently with the editor suggests potentially useful morphologic descriptions based on similar documents existing in the library. Benefits derived from the introduction of Chrysalis include reduced potential for errors and data inconsistencies, increased parallelism among descriptions, and considerable savings in the time regularly spent in visually checking for parallelism and manually editing data.

Effective Temporal Aggregation using Point-based Trees . Temporal databases introduce the concept of time into underlying  data, and provide built-in facilities that allow users to store and  retrieve time-varying data. The aggregation in temporal databases, that  is, temporal aggregation is an extension of conventional aggregation on  the domain and range of aggregates to include time concept. Temporal  aggregation is important for various applications, but is very expensive.  In this paper, we propose a new tree structure for temporal aggregation,  called PA-tree, and aggregate processing method based on the PA-tree.  We show that the time complexity of the proposed method is better  than those of the existing methods. The time complexity of the proposed  method is shown to be indeed the lower bound of the problem.

Business Suitability Principles for Workflow Modelling By incorporating aspects of coordination and collaboration, workflow implementations of information systems require a sound conceptualisation of business processing semantics. Traditionally, the success of conceptual modelling techniques has depended largely on the adequacy of conceptualisation, expressive power, comprehensibility and formal foundation. An equally important requirement, particularly with the increased conceptualisation of business aspects, is business suitability.  In this paper, the focus is on the business suitability of workflow modelling for a commonly encountered class of (operational) business processing, e.g. those of insurance claims, bank loans and land conveyancing. A general assessment is first conducted on some integrated  techniques characterising well-known paradigms - structured process modelling, object-oriented modelling, behavioural process modelling and business-oriented modelling. Through this, an insight into business suitability within the broader...

A Scalable and Ontology-Based P2P Infrastructure for Semantic Web Services Semantic Web Services are a promising combination of Semantic Web and Web service technology, aiming at providing means of automatically executing, discovering and composing semantically marked-up Web services. We envision peer-to-peer networks which allow for carrying out searches in real-time on permanently reconfiguring networks to be an ideal injastructure for deploying a network of Semantic Web Service providers. However, P2P networks evolving in an unorganized manner suffer jom serious scalability problems, limiting the number of nodes in the network, creating network overload and pushing search times to unacceptable limits. We address these problems by imposing a deterministic shape on P2P networks: We propose a graph topology which allows for very efficient broadcast and search, and we provide an efficient topology construction and maintenance algorithm which, crucial to symmetric peer-to-peer networks, does neither require a central server nor super nodes in the network. We show how our scheme can be made even more efficient by using a globally known ontology to determine the organization of peers in the graph topology, allowing for efficient concept-based search.

Response Generation in Collaborative Negotiation In collaborative planning activities, since the agents are autonomous and heterogeneous, it is inevitable that conflicts arise in their beliefs during the planning process. In cases where such conflicts are relevant to the task at hand, the agents should engage in collaborative negotiation  as an attempt to square away the discrepancies in their beliefs. This paper presents a computational strategy for detecting conflicts regarding proposed beliefs and for engaging in collaborative negotiation to resolve the conflicts that warrant resolution. Our model is capable of selecting the most effective aspect to address in its pursuit of conflict resolution in cases where multiple conflicts arise, and of selecting appropriate evidence to justify the need for such modification. Furthermore, by capturing the negotiation process in a recursive  Propose-Evaluate-Modify cycle of actions, our model can successfully handle embedded negotiation subdialogues.  1 Introduction  In collaborative consultat...

View Security as the Basis for Data Warehouse Security Access  .  permissions in a data warehouse are  currently managed in a separate world from  the sources' policies. The consequences are  inconsistencies, slow response to change, and  wasted administrative work. We present a  different approach, which treats the sources'  exported tables and the warehouse as part of  the same distributed database. Our main result  is a way to control derived products by  extending SQL grants rather than creating  entirely new mechanisms. We provide a  powerful, sound inference theory that derives  permissions on warehouse tables (both  materialized and virtual), making the system  easier to administer and its applications more  robust.

Achieving Consistency in Mobile Databases through Localization in PRO-MOTION There is great need and potential for traditional transaction support in a mobile computing environment. However, owing to the inherent limitations of mobile computing, we need to augment the well-developed techniques of Database Management Systems with new approaches. In this paper, we focus on the challenge of assuring data consistency. Our approach of localization is to reformulate global constraints so as to enhance the autonomy of the mobile hosts. We show how this approach unifies techniques of maintaining replicated data with methods of enforcing polynomial inequalities. We also discuss how localization can be implemented in PRO-MOTION, a flexible infrastructure for transaction processing in a mobile environment.  1.

Optimizatizing the Performance of Schema Evolution Sequences More than ever before schema transformation is a prevalent problem that needs to be addressed to accomplish for example the migration of legacy systems to the newer OODB systems, the generation of structured web pages from data in database systems, or the integration of systems with different native data models. Such schema transformations are typically composed of a sequence of schema evolution operations. The execution of such sequences can be very timeintensive, possibly requiring many hours or even days and thus effectively making the database unavailable for unacceptable time spans. While researchers have looked at the deferred execution approach for schema evolution in an effort to improve availability of the system, to the best of our knowledge ours is the first effort to provide a direct optimization strategy for a sequence of changes. In this paper, we propose heuristics for the iterative elimination and cancellation of schema evolution primitives as well as for the merging of...

Web Mining Research: A Survey With the huge amount of information available online, the World Wide Web is a fertile area for data mining research. The Web mining research is at the cross road of research from several research communities, such as database, information retrieval, and within AI, especially the sub-areas of machine learning and natural language processing. However, there is a lot of confusions when comparing research efforts from different point of views. In this paper, we survey the research in the area of Web mining, point out some confusions regarded the usage of the term Web mining and suggest three Web mining categories. Then we situate some of the research with respect to these three categories. We also explore the connection between the Web mining categories and the related agent paradigm. For the survey, we focus on representation issues, on the process, on the learning algorithm, and on the application of the recent works as the criteria. We conclude the paper with some research issues.

Digital Library Resources as a Basis for Collaborative Work The creation of large, networked, digital document resources has greatly facilitated information access and dissemination. We suggest that such resources can further enhance how we work with information, namely, that they can provide a substrate that supports collaborative work. We focus on one form of collaboration, annotation, by which we mean any of an open-ended number of creative document manipulations which are useful to record and to share with others.  Widespread digital document dissemination required technological enablers, such as web clients and servers. The resulting infrastructure is one in which information may be widely shared by individuals across administrative boundaries. To achieve the same ubiquitous availability for annotation requires providing support for spontaneous collaboration, that is, for collaboration across administrative boundaries without significant prior agreements. Annotation is not more commonplace, we suggest, because the technological needs of sp...

MSVT: A Virtual Reality-Based Multimodal Scientific Visualization Tool Recent approaches to providing users with more natural methods of interacting with virtual environment applications have shown that more than one mode of input can be both beneficial and intuitive as a communication medium between humans and computer applications. Although there are many different modes that could be used in these applications, hand gestures and speech appear to be two of the most logical since users will typically be in environments that will have them immersed in a virtual world with limited access to traditional input devices such as the keyboard or mouse.

Pruning Decision Trees with Misclassification Costs . We describe an experimental study of pruning methods for decision tree classifiers when the goal is minimizing loss rather than error. In addition to two common methods for error minimization, CART's cost-complexity pruning and C4.5's error-based pruning, we study the extension of cost-complexity pruning to loss and one pruning variant based on the Laplace correction. We perform an empirical comparison of these methods and evaluate them with respect to loss. We found that applying the Laplace correction to estimate the probability distributions at the leaves was beneficial to all pruning methods. Unlike in error minimization, and somewhat surprisingly, performing no pruning led to results that were on par with other methods in terms of the evaluation criteria. The main advantage of pruning was in the reduction of the decision tree size, sometimes by a factor of ten. While no method dominated others on all datasets, even for the same domain different pruning mechanisms are better for ...

Compiling for Fast State Capture of Mobile Agents Saving, transporting, and restoring the state of a mobile agent is one of the main problems in implementing a mobile agents system. We present an approach, implemented as part of our Messengers system, that represents a trade-off between the unrestricted use of pointers and the ability to perform fully transparent state capture. When writing the code for an agent, the programmer has a choice between two types of functions. C functions are fully general and may use unrestricted pointers, but they are not allowed to invoke any migration commands. Messengers functions may cause migration but their use of pointers is restricted to only a special type of a dynamic array structure. Under these restrictions, the local variables, the program counter, and the calling stack of an agent can all be made machine-independent and can be captured/restored transparently during migration. 1 Introduction  Saving, transporting, and restoring the state of a mobile agent is one of the main problem in implem...

Speech and Gesture Multimodal Control of a Whole Earth 3D Visualization Environment A growing body of research shows several advantages to multimodal interfaces including increased expressiveness, flexibility, and user freedom. This paper investigates the design of such an interface that integrates speech and hand gestures. The interface has the additional property of operating relative to the user and can be used while the user is in motion or stands at a distance from the computer display. The paper then describes an implementation of the multimodal interface for a whole earth 3D visualization environment which presents navigation interface challenges due to the large magnitude of scale and extended spaces that is available. The characteristics of the multimodal interface are examined, such as speed, recognizability of gestures, ease and accuracy of use, and learnability under likely conditions of use. This implementation shows that such a multimodal interface can be e#ective in a real environment and sets some parameters for the design and use of such interfaces.

Decidable Fragments of First-Order Temporal Logics In this paper, we introduce a new fragment of the first-order temporal language, called the monodic fragment, in which all formulas beginning with a temporal operator (Since or Until) have at most one free variable. We show that the satisfiability problem for monodic formulas in various linear time structures can be reduced to the satisfiability problem for a certain fragment of classical first-order logic. This reduction is then used to single out a number of decidable fragments of first-order temporal logics and of two-sorted first-order logics in which one sort is intended for temporal reasoning. Besides standard first-order time structures, we consider also those that have only finite first-order domains, and extend the results mentioned above to temporal logics of finite domains. We prove decidability in three different ways: using decidability of monadic second-order logic over the intended flows of time, by an explicit analysis of structures with natural numbers time, and by a composition method that builds a model from pieces in finitely many steps. 1

Text Database Selection for Longer Queries A metasearch engine is a system that supports unified access to multiple local search engines. One of the main challenges in building a large-scale metasearch engine is to solve the database (search engine) selection problem, which is to efficiently and accurately determine a small number of potentially useful local search engines to invoke for each user query. For the database of each search engine, a representative which indicates approximately the contents of the database is created in advance to enable database selection. The representatives of all databases can be integrated into a single representative to make the selection process more scalable. While an integrated representative with high scalability has just been proposed and has been found to be effective for short queries, its effectiveness for longer queries is significantly lower. In the Internet environment, most queries initially submitted by users are short queries. However, it has been found that better search effectiveness can often be achieved when additional terms are added to the initial queries through query expansion or relevance feedback. The resulting queries are usually longer than the initial queries. In this paper, we propose a new method to construct database representatives and to decide which databases to select for longer queries. Experimental results are given to compare the performance of the new method with that of a previous method.

Incremental Learning of Explanation Patterns and their Indices This paper describes how a reasoner can improve its understanding of an incompletely understood domain through the application of what it already knows to novel problems in that domain. Recent work in AI has dealt with the issue of using past explanations stored in the reasoner's memory to understand novel situations. However, this process assumes that past explanations are well understood and provide good "lessons" to be used for future situations. This assumption is usually false when one is learning about a novel domain, since situations encountered previously in this domain might not have been understood completely. Instead, it is reasonable to assume that the reasoner would have gaps in its knowledge base. By reasoning about a new situation, the reasoner should be able to fill in these gaps as new information came in, reorganize its explanations in memory, and gradually evolve a better understanding of its domain. We present a story understanding program that retrieves past explan...

Equivalence in Knowledge Representation: Automata, Recurrent Neural Networks, and Dynamical Fuzzy Systems Neurofuzzy systems-the combination of artificial neural networks with fuzzy logic-have become useful in many application domains. However, conventional neurofuzzy models usually need enhanced representation power for applications that require context and state (e.g., speech, time series prediction, control). Some of these applications can be readily modeled as finite state automata. Previously, it was proved that deterministic finite state automata (DFA) can be synthesized by or mapped into recurrent neural networks by directly programming the DFA structure into the weights of the neural network. Based on those results, a synthesis method is proposed for mapping fuzzy finite state automata (FFA) into recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, this mapping is suitable for direct implementation in very large scale integration (VLSI), i.e., the encoding of FFA as a generalization of the encoding of DFA in VLSI systems. The synthesis method requires FFA to undergo a transformation prior to being mapped into recurrent networks. The neurons are provided with an enriched functionality in order to accommodate a fuzzy representation of FFA states. This enriched neuron functionality also permits fuzzy parameters of FFA to be directly represented as parameters of the neural network. We also prove the stability of fuzzy finite state dynamics of the constructed neural networks for finite values of network weight and, through simulations, give empirical validation of the proofs. Hence, we prove various knowledge equivalence representations between neural and fuzzy systems and models of automata.

This paper presents initially some systems dealing with object localization and classification, analyzing the performance and implementation of each work. After we propose a system for localization and classification of shapes using reconfigurable devices (FPGA) and a signal processor (DSP) available in a flexible codesign platform. The system will be described using C and VHDL languages, for the software and hardware parts respectively, and has been implemented in an APTIX prototyping platform.  1.

Most of the current WFMSs are built on traditional relational database systems and/or using an objectoriented database system for storing the definition and run time data about the workflows. However, a WFMS requires advanced modeling functionalities to support adaptive features, such as on-line exception handling.

Finding the desired search engines and learning how to use them, however, can be very time consuming. The integration of such search tools enables the users to access information across the world in a transparent and efficient manner. These systems are called meta-search engines. The recent emergence of visual information retrieval (VIR) search engines on the web is leading to the same efficiency problem. This paper describes and evaluates MetaSEEk, a content-based meta-search engine used for finding images on the Web based on their visual information. MetaSEEk is designed to intelligently select and interface with multiple on-line image search engines by ranking their performance for different classes of user queries. User feedback is also integrated in the ranking refinement. We compare MetaSEEk with a base line version of meta-search engine, which does not use the past performance of the different search engines in recommending target search engines for future queries.

Acquisition of Place Knowledge Through Case-Based Learning In this paper we define the task of place learning and describe one approach to this problem. The framework represents distinct places as evidence grids, a probabilistic description of occupancy. Place recognition relies on case-based classification, augmented by a registration process to correct for translations. The learning mechanism is also similar to that in case-based systems, involving the simple storage of inferred evidence grids. Experimental studies with physical and simulated robots suggest that this approach improves place recognition with experience, that it can handle significant sensor noise, that it benefits from improved quality in stored cases, and that it scales well to environments with many distinct places. Previous researchers have studied evidence grids and place learning, but they have not combined these two powerful concepts, nor have they used the experimental methods of machine learning to evaluate their methods' abilities.

Most existing systems that offer an IQE facility use a list form of presentation. This paper examines an hierarchical presentation of the expansion terms which are automatically generated from a set of retrieved documents, organised in a general to specific manner, and visualised by cascade menus. To evaluate the effectiveness of the presentation, a user test was carried out to compare the hierarchical form with the conventional list form. This shows that users of the hierarchy can complete the expansion task in less time and with fewer terms over those using the lists. Relations between initial query terms and selected expansion terms were also investigated.  Keywords  Information retrieval, interactive query expansion, concept hierarchies 1.

Seamless Guidance by Personal Agent in Virtual Space Based on User Interaction in Real World This paper describes a personal agent that guides a visitor through a virtual space by using context, i.e., visitor interaction, in the real world. #Context-aware# guidance in the real world has become an increasingly important research demand since the advent of small and powerful palmtop computers, or PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants), that can obtain useful information about objects in the real world based on context (e.g., current location and visit history) in the real world. We have tried to extend this context-aware guidance into a virtual environment by using context not from the virtual environment but from the real world; such seamless guidance allows visitors to concentrate their attention on the understanding of actual elements. This paper reports our experiment on seamless guidance by a personal agent in a virtual ancient village using real-world context. This was presented at an open house exhibition in our research laboratories. 1 Introduction  We have proposed a notion...

Merging Potentially Inconsistent Items of Structured Text Structured text is a general concept that is implicit in a variety of approaches to handling  information. Syntactically, an item of structured text is a number of grammatically simple  phrases together with a semantic label for each phrase. Items of structured text may be nested  within larger items of structured text. The semantic labels in a structured text are meant to  parameterize a stereotypical situation, and so a particular item of structured text is an instance  of that stereotypical situation. Much information is potentially available as structured text  including tagged text in XML, text in relational and object-oriented databases, and the output  from information extraction systems in the form of instantiated templates. In this paper, we  formalize the concept of structured text, and then focus on how we can identify inconsistency  in the logical representation of items of structured text. We then present a new framework  for merging logical theories that can be employed t...

MARS: a Programmable Coordination Architecture for Mobile Agents Mobile agents represent a promising technology for the development of Internet  applications. However, mobile computational entities introduce peculiar problems  w.r.t. the coordination of the application components. The paper outlines the  advantages of Linda-like coordination models, and shows how a programmable  coordination model based on reactive tuple spaces can provide further desirable  features for Internet applications based on mobile agents. Accordingly, the paper  presents the design and the implementation of the MARS coordination architecture for  Java-based mobile agents. MARS defines Linda-like tuple spaces, which can be  programmed to react with specific actions to the accesses made by mobile agents.

Text-Based Content Search and Retrieval in ad hoc P2P Communities We consider the problem of content search and retrieval in peer-to-peer (P2P) communities. P2P computing is a potentially powerful model for information sharing between ad hoc groups' of users because of its' low cost of entry and natural model for resource scaling with community size. As P2P communities grow in size, however, locating information distributed across the large number of peers becomes problematic. We present a distributed text-based content search and retrieval algorithm to address this' problem. Our algorithm is' based on a state-of-the-art text-based document ranking algorithm: the vector-space model instantiated with the TFxlDF ranking rule. A naive application of TFxlDF wouM require each peer in a community to collect an inverted index of the entire community. This' is' costly both in terms of bandwidth and storage. Instea & we show how TFxlDF can be approximated given compact summaries of peers' local inverted indexes. We make three contributions: (a) we show how the TFxlDF rule can be adapted to use the index summaries, (b) we provide a heuristic for adaptively determining the set of peers that shouM be contacted for a query, and (c) we show that our algorithm tracks' TFxlDF's performance very closely, regardless of how documents' are distributed throughout the community. Furthermore, our algorithm preserves the main flavor of TFxlDF by retrieving close to the same set of documents for any given query.

Projective Rotations applied to a Pan-Tilt Stereo Head A non-metric pan-tilt stereo-head consists of a weakly calibrated stereo rig mounted on a pan-tilt mechanism. It is called non-metric since neither the kinematics of the mechanism, nor camera calibration are required. The Lie group of "projective rotations"- homographies of projective space corresponding to pure rotations -- is an original formalism to model the geometry of such a pan-tilt system. A Rodrigues alike formula as well as a minimal parameterization of projective rotations are introduced. Based on this, the practical part devises a numerical optimization technique for accurately estimating projective rotations from point correspondences, only. This procedure recovers sufficient geometry to operate the system. The experiments validate and evaluate the proposed approach on real image data. They show the weak calibration, image prediction, and homing of a non-metric pan-tilt head.  1 Introduction  One of the most useful sensors in computer vision is a pan and tilt stereo head. ...

Optimization Techniques For Queries with Expensive Methods Object-Relational database management systems allow knowledgeable users to de ne new data types, as well as new methods (operators) for the types. This exibility produces an attendant complexity, which must be handled in new ways for an Object-Relational database management system to be e cient. In this paper we study techniques for optimizing queries that contain time-consuming methods. The focus of traditional query optimizers has been on the choice of join methods and orders; selections have been handled by \pushdown " rules. These rules apply selections in an arbitrary order before as many joins as possible, using the assumption that selection takes no time. However, users of Object-Relational systems can embed complex methods in selections. Thus selections may take signi cant amounts of time, and the query optimization model must be enhanced. In this paper, we carefully de ne a query cost framework that incorporates both selectivity and cost estimates for selections. We develop an algorithm called Predicate Migration, and prove that it produces optimal plans for queries with expensive methods. We then describe our implementation of Predicate Migration in the commercial Object-Relational database management system Illustra, and discuss practical issues that a ect our earlier assumptions. We compare Predicate Migration to a variety of simpler optimization techniques, and demonstrate that Predicate Migration is the best general solution to date. The alternative techniques we presentmaybe useful for constrained workloads.

Functional Join Processing . Inter-object references are one of the key concepts of object-relational and object-oriented database systems. In this work, we investigate alternative techniques to implement inter-object references and make the best use of them in query processing, i.e., in evaluating functional joins. We will give a comprehensive overview and performance evaluation of all known techniques for simple (singlevalued) as well as multi-valued functional joins. Furthermore, we will describe special order-preserving functionaljoin techniques that are particularly attractive for decision support queries that require ordered results. While most of the presentation of this paper is focused on object-relational and object-oriented database systems, some of the results can also be applied to plain relational databases because index nested-loop joins along key/foreign-key relationships, as they are frequently found in relational databases, are just one particular way to execute a functional join.

Managing Robot Autonomy and Interactivity Using Motives and Visual Communication An autonomous mobile robot operating in everyday life conditions will have to face a huge variety of situations and to interact with other agents (living or artificial). Such a robot needs flexible and robust methods for managing its goals and for adapting its control mechanisms to face the contingencies of the world. It also needs to communicate with others in order to get useful information about the world. This paper describes an approach based on a general architecture and on internal variables called `motives' to manage the goals of an autonomous robot. These variables are also used as a basis for communication using a visual communication system. Experiments using a vision- and sonar-based Pioneer I robot, equipped with a visual signaling device, are presented.  1 Introduction  Designing an autonomous mobile robot to operate in unmodified environments, i.e., environments that have not been specifically engineered for the robot, is a very challenging problems.

Approximate Query Translation across Heterogeneous Information Sources In this paper we present a mechanism for  approximately translating Boolean query constraints  across heterogeneous information sources.  Achieving the best translation is challenging because  sources support different constraints for formulating  queries, and often these constraints cannot  be precisely translated. For instance, a query  [score ? 8] might be "perfectly" translated as  [rating ? 0.8] at some site, but can only be approximated  as [grade = A] at another. Unlike  other work, our general framework adopts a customizable  "closeness" metric for the translation  that combines both precision and recall. Our results  show that for query translation we need to  handle interdependencies among both query conjuncts  as well as disjuncts. As the basis, we identify  the essential requirements of a rule system for  users to encode the mappings for atomic semantic  units. Our algorithm then translates complex  queries by rewriting them in terms of the semantic  units. We show that, un...

Automatic Text Representation, Classification and Labeling in European Law The huge text archives and retrieval systems of legal information have not achieved yet the representation in the wellknown subject-oriented structure of legal commentaries. Content-based classification and text analysis remains a high priority research topic. In the joint KONTERM, SOM and LabelSOM projects, learning techniques of neural networks are used to achieve similar high compression rates of classification and analysis like in manual legal indexing. The produced maps of legal text corpora cluster related documents in units that are described with automatically selected descriptors. Extensive tests with text corpora in European case law have shown the feasibility of this approach. Classification and labeling proved very helpful for legal research. The Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map represents very interesting generalities and specialties of legal text corpora. The segmentation into document parts improved very much the quality of labeling. The next challenge would be a change from tfxidf vector representation to a modified vector representation taking into account thesauri or ontologies considering learned properties of legal text corpora.

Concurrency Control and Recovery in Transactional Process Management The classical theory of transaction management contains two different aspects, namely concurrency control and recovery, which ensure serializability and atomicity of transaction executions, respectively. Although concurrency control and recovery are not independent of each other, the criteria for these two aspects were developed orthogonally and as a result, in most cases these criteria are incompatible with each other. Recently a unified theory of concurrency control and recovery for databases with read and write operations has been introduced in [SWY93, AVA  +  94] that allows reasoning about serializability and atomicity within the same framework. In [SWY93, AVA  +  94] a class of schedules was introduced (called prefix reducible),  which guarantees both serializability and atomicity in a failure prone environment with read/write operations. Several protocols were developed to generate such schedules by a database concurrency control mechanism. We present here a unified transaction ...

Supporting Conflict Resolution in Cooperative Design Systems Complex modern-day artifacts are designed cooperatively by groups of experts, each with their own areas of expertise. The interaction of such experts inevitably involves conflict. This paper presents an implemented computational model, based on studies of human cooperative design, for supporting the resolution of such conflicts. This model is based centrally on the insights that general conflict resolution expertise exists separately from domain-level design expertise, and that this expertise can be instantiated in the context of particular conflicts into specific advice for resolving those conflicts. Conflict resolution expertise consists of a taxonomy of design conflict classes in addition to associated general advice suitable for resolving conflicts in these classes. The abstract nature of conflict resolution expertise makes it applicable to a wide variety of design domains. This paper describes this conflict resolution model and provides examples of its operation from an implemente...

Computing Iceberg Queries Efficiently Many applications compute aggregate functions (such as COUNT, SUM) over an attribute (or set of attributes) to find aggregate values above some specified threshold. We call such queries iceberg queries because the number of above-threshold results is often very small (the tip of an iceberg), relative to the large amount of input data (the iceberg). Such iceberg queries are common in many applications, including data warehousing, information-retrieval, market basket analysis in data mining, clustering and copy detection. We propose efficient algorithms to evaluate iceberg queries using very little memory and significantly fewer passes over data, as compared to current techniques that use sorting or hashing. We present an experimental case study using over three gigabytes of Web data to illustrate the savings obtained by our algorithms.  1 Introduction  In this paper we develop efficient execution strategies for an important class of queries that we call iceberg queries.

Assessing Software Libraries by Browsing Similar Classes, Functions, and Relationships Comparing and contrasting a set of software libraries is useful for reuse related activities such as selecting a library from among several candidates or porting an application from one library to another. The current state of the art in assessing libraries relies on qualitative methods. To reduce costs and/or assess a large collection of libraries, automation is necessary. Although there are tools that help a developer examine an individual library in terms of architecture, style, etc., we know of no tools that help the developer directly compare several libraries. With existing tools, the user must manually integrate the knowledge learned about each library. Automation to help developers directly compare and contrast libraries requires matching of similar components (such as classes and functions) across libraries. This is different than the traditional component retrieval problem in which components are returned that best match a user's query. Rather, we need to find those component...

Self-Organization in Ad Hoc Sensor Networks: An Empirical Study Research in classifying and recognizing complex concepts  has been directing its focus increasingly on distributed  sensing using a large amount of sensors. The colossal  amount of sensor data often obstructs traditional algorithms  in centralized approaches, where all sensor data is directed  to one central location to be processed. Spreading the  processing of sensor data over the network seems to be a  promising option, but distributed algorithms are harder to  inspect and evaluate. Using self-sufficient sensor boards  with short-range wireless communication capabilities, we  are exploring approaches to achieve an emerging  distributed perception of the sensed environment in realtime  through clustering. Experiments in both simulation  and real-world platforms indicate that this is a valid  methodology, being especially promising for computation  on many units with limited resources.

Clustering Large Datasets in Arbitrary Metric Spaces Clustering partitions a collection of objects into groups called clusters, such that similar objects fall into the same group. Similarity between objects is defined by a distance function satisfying the triangle inequality; this distance function along with the collection of objects describes a distance space. In a distance space, the only operation possible on data objects is the computation of distance between them. All scalable algorithms in the literature assume a special type of distance space, namely a k-dimensional vector space, which allows vector operations on objects. We present two scalable algorithms designed for clustering very large datasets in distance spaces. Our first algorithm BUBBLE is, to our knowledge, the first scalable clustering algorithm for data in a distance space. Our second algorithm BUBBLE-FM improves upon BUBBLE by reducing the number of calls to the distance function, which may be computationally very expensive. Both algorithms make only a single scan ov...

Manipulating Interpolated Data is Easier than You Thought Data defined by interpolation is frequently  found in new applications involving geographical  entities, moving objects, or spatiotemporal  data. These data lead to potentially  infinite collections of items, (e.g., the elevation  of any point in a map), whose definitions  are based on the association of a collection of  samples with an interpolation function. The  naive manipulation of the data through direct  access to both the samples and the interpolation  functions leads to cumbersome or inaccurate  queries. It is desirable to hide the  samples and the interpolation functions from  the logical level, while their manipulation is  performed automatically.  We propose to model such data using infinite  relations (e.g., the map with elevation yields  an infinite ternary relation) which can be manipulated  through standard relational query  languages (e.g., SQL), with no mention of the  interpolated definition. The clear separation  between logical and physical levels ensures the  accu...

Reasoning with Concrete Domains Description logics are knowledge representation and reasoning formalisms  which represent conceptual knowledge on an abstract logical  level. Concrete domains are a theoretically well-founded approach to  the integration of description logic reasoning with reasoning about  concrete objects such as numbers, time intervals or spatial regions. In  this paper, the complexity of combined reasoning with description logics  and concrete domains is investigated. We extend ALC(D), which  is the basic description logic for reasoning with concrete domains, by  the operators "feature agreement" and "feature disagreement". For  the extended logic, called ALCF(D), an algorithm for deciding the  ABox consistency problem is devised. The strategy employed by this  algorithm is vital for the efficient implementation of reasoners for description  logics incorporating concrete domains. Based on the algorithm,  it is proved that the standard reasoning problems for both  logics ALC(D) and ALCF(D) are PSpace-co...

Highly Concurrent Shared Storage . Shared storage arrays enable thousands of storage devices to be shared and directly  accessed by end hosts over switched system-area networks, promising databases and filesystems highly  scalable, reliable storage. In such systems, hosts perform access tasks (read and write) and management  tasks (migration and reconstruction of data on failed devices.) Each task translates into multiple  phases of low-level device I/Os, so that concurrent host tasks can span multiple shared devices and  access overlapping ranges potentially leading to inconsistencies for redundancy codes and for data  read by end hosts. Highly scalable concurrency control and recovery protocols are required to coordinate  on-line storage management and access tasks. While expressing storage-level tasks as ACID transactions  ensures proper concurrency control and recovery, such an approach imposes high performance  overhead, results in replication of work and does not exploit the available knowledge about storage  le...

Collaborative Learning for Recommender Systems Recommender systems use ratings from users on items such as movies and music for the purpose of predicting the user preferences on items that have not been rated. Predictions are normally done by using the ratings of other users of the system, by learning the user preference as a function of the features of the items or by a combination of both these methods. In this paper, we pose the problem as one of collaboratively learning of preference functions by multiple users of the recommender system. We study several mixture models for this task. We show, via theoretical analyses and experiments on a movie rating database, how the models can be designed to overcome common problems in recommender systems including the new user problem, the recurring startup problem, the sparse rating problem and the scaling problem. 1.

Dynamic Service Matchmaking Among Agents in Open Information Environments Introduction  The amount of services and deployed software agents in the most famous offspring of the Internet, the World Wide Web, is exponentially increasing. In addition, the Internet is an open environment, where information sources, communication links and agents themselves may appear and disappear unpredictably. Thus, an effective, automated search and selection of relevant services or agents is essential for human users and agents as well. We distinguish three general agent categories in the Cyberspace, service providers, service requester,  and middle agents. Service providers provide some type of service, such as finding information, or performing some particular domain specific problem solving. Requester agents need provider agents to perform some service for them. Agents that help locate others are called middle agents[2].

Scaling Personalized Web Search Recent web search techniques augment traditional text matching with a global notion of ‚Äúimportance ‚Äù based on the linkage structure of the web, such as in Google‚Äôs PageRank algorithm. For more refined searches, this global notion of importance can be specialized to create personalized views of importance‚Äîfor example, importance scores can be biased according to a user-specified set of initially-interesting pages. Computing and storing all possible personalized views in advance is impractical, as is computing personalized views at query time, since the computation of each view requires an iterative computation over the web graph. We present new graph-theoretical results, and a new technique based on these results, that encode personalized views as partial vectors. Partial vectors are shared across multiple personalized views, and their computation and storage costs scale well with the number of views. Our approach enables incremental computation, so that the construction of personalized views from partial vectors is practical at query time. We present efficient dynamic programming algorithms for computing partial vectors, an algorithm for constructing personalized views from partial vectors, and experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of our techniques. 1

Regularized Principal Manifolds . Many settings of unsupervised learning can be viewed as quantization problems --- the minimization of the expected quantization error subject to some restrictions. This allows the use of tools such as regularization from the theory of (supervised) risk minimization for unsupervised settings. This setting turns out to be closely related to principal curves, the generative topographic map, and robust coding. We explore this connection in two ways: 1) we propose an algorithm for finding principal manifolds that can be regularized in a variety of ways. 2) We derive uniform convergence bounds and hence bounds on the learning rates of the algorithm. In particular, we give bounds on the covering numbers which allows us to obtain nearly optimal learning rates for certain types of regularization operators. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. Keywords: Regularization, Uniform Convergence, Kernels, Entropy Numbers, Principal Curves, Clustering, Generative Topograph...

Integrating Case-Based Learning and Cognitive Biases for Machine Learning of Natural Language This paper shows that psychological constraints on human information processing can be used effectively  to guide feature set selection for case-based learning of linguistic knowledge.

We apply the cognitive bias approach to  feature set selection to four natural language learning problems and show that performance of the casebased  learning algorithm improves significantly when relevant cognitive biases are incorporated into the  baseline instance representation. We argue that the cognitive bias approach offers new possibilities for  case-based learning of natural language: it simplifies the process of instance representation design and, in  theory, obviates the need for separate instance represent...

A Study of Approaches to Hypertext Categorization Hypertext poses new research challenges for text classification. Hyperlinks, HTML  tags, category labels distributed over linked documents, and meta data extracted from related Web sites all provide rich information for classifying hypertext documents. How to appropriately represent that information and automatically learn statistical patterns for solving hypertext classification problems is an open question. This paper seeks a principled approach to providing the answers. Specifically, we define five hypertext regularities which may (or may not) hold in a particular application domain, and whose presence (or absence) may significantly influence the optimal design of a classifier. Using three hypertext datasets and three well-known learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, and First Order Inductive Learner), we examine these regularities in different domains, and compare alternative ways to exploit them. Our results show that the identification of hypertext regularities in the data and the selection of appropriate representations for hypertext in particular domains are crucial, but seldom obvious, in real-world problems. We find that adding the words in the linked neighborhood to the page having those links (both inlinks and outlinks) were helpful for all our classifiers on one data set, but more harmful than helpful for two out of the three classifiers on the remaining datasets. We also observed that extracting meta data from related Web sites was extremely useful for improving classification accuracy in some of those domains. Finally, the relative performance of the classifiers being tested provided insights into their strengths and limitations for solving classification problems involving diverse and often noisy Web pages.

Comparison of Learning Approaches to Appearance-based 3D Object Recognition with and without cluttered background We re-evaluate the application of Support Vector Machines (SVM) to appearance-based 3D object recognition, by comparing it to two other learning approaches: the system developed at Columbia University ("Columbia") and a simple image matching system using a nearest neighbor classifier ("NNC").  In a first set of experiments, we compare correct recognition rates of the segmented 3D object images of the COIL database. We show that the performance of the simple "NNC" system compares to the more elaborated "Columbia" and "SVM" systems. Only when the experimental setting is more demanding, i.e. when we reduce the number of views during the training phase, some difference in performance can be observed. In a second set of experiments, we consider the more realistic task of 3D object recognition with cluttered background. Also in this case, we obtain that the performance of the three systems are comparable. Only with the recently proposed black/white background training scheme ("BW") applied t...

Rooms, Protocols, and Nets: Metaphors for Computer Supported Cooperative Learning of Distributed Groups : We discuss an integrative design for computer supported cooperative learning (CSCL) environments. Three common problems of CSCL are addressed: How to achieve social orientation and group awareness, how to coordinate goal-directed interaction, and how to construct a shared knowledge base. With respect to each problem, we propose a guiding metaphor which links theoretical, technical, and usability requirements. If appropriately implemented, each metaphor resolves one problem: Virtual rooms support social orientation, learning protocols guide interactions aimed at knowledge acquisition, and learning nets represent socially shared knowledge. Theoretically, the metaphor of virtual rooms originates in work on virtual spaces in human computer interaction, learning protocols are related to speech act theory, and learning nets are based on models of knowledge representation. A prototype system implementing the virtual room metaphor is presented. We argue that by further integrating these thre...

An Algebraic Compression Framework for Query Results Decision-support applications in emerging environments require that SQL query results or intermediate results be shipped to clients for further analysis and presentation. These clients may use low bandwidth connections or have severe storage restrictions. Consequently, there is a need to compress the results of a query for efficient transfer and client-side access. This paper explores a variety of techniques that address this issue. Instead of using a fixed method, we choose a combination of compression methods that use statistical and semantic information of the query results to enhance the effect of compression. To represent such a combination, we present a framework of "compression plans" formed by composing primitive compression operators. We also present optimization algorithms that enumerate valid compression plans and choose an optimal plan.

Learning and Tracking Cyclic Human Motion We present methods for learning and tracking human motion in  video. We estimate a statistical model of typical activities from a  large set of 3D periodic human motion data by segmenting these  data automatically into "cycles". Then the mean and the principal  components of the cycles are computed using a new algorithm  that accounts for missing information and enforces smooth transitions  between cycles. The learned temporal model provides a  prior probability distribution over human motions that can be used  in a Bayesian framework for tracking human subjects in complex  monocular video sequences and recovering their 3D motion.

Does Zooming Improve Image Browsing? We describe an image retrieval system we built based on a Zoomable User Interface (ZUI). We also discuss the design, results and analysis of a controlled experiment we performed on the browsing aspects of the system. The experiment resulted in a statistically significant difference in the interaction between number of images (25, 75, 225) and style of browser (2D, ZUI, 3D). The 2D and ZUI browser systems performed equally, and both performed better than the 3D systems. The image browsers tested during the experiment include Cerious Software's Thumbs Plus, TriVista Technology's Simple LandScape and Photo GoRound, and our Zoomable Image Browser based on Pad++.

Learning Strategy Knowledge Incrementally Modern industrial processes require advanced computer tools that should adapt to the user requirements and to the tasks being solved. Strategy learning consists of automating the acquisition of patterns of actions used while solving particular tasks. Current intelligent strategy learning systems acquire operational knowledge to improve the efficiency of a particular problem solver. However, these strategy learning tools should also provide a way of achieving low-cost solutions according to user-specific criteria. In this paper, we present a learning system, hamlet, which is integrated in a planning architecture, prodigy, and acquires control knowledge to guide prodigy to efficiently produce cost-effective plans. hamlet learns from planning episodes, by explaining why the correct decisions were made, and later refines the learned strategy knowledge to make it incrementally correct with experience.

Modeling Sociality In The BDI Framework . We present a conceptual model for how the social nature of agents impacts upon their individual mental states. Roles and social relationships provide an abstraction upon which we develop the notion of social mental shaping . 1 Introduction Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) architectures for deliberative agents are based on the physical symbol system assumption that agents maintain and reason about internal representations of their world [2]. However, while such architectures conceptualise individual intentionality and behaviour, they say nothing about the social aspects of agents being situated in a multi-agent system. The main reason for this limitation is that mental attitudes are taken to be internal to a particular agent (or team) and are modeled as a relation between the agent (or a team) and a proposition. The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to extend BDI models in order to investigate the problem of how the social nature of agents can impact upon their individual mental ...

Clause Aggregation Using Linguistic Knowledge By combining multiple clauses into one single sentence, a text generation system can express the same amount of information in fewer words and at the same time, produce a great variety of complex constructions. In this paper, we describe hypotactic and paratactic operators for generating complex sentences from clause-sized semantic representations. These two types of operators are portable and reusable because they are based on general resources such as the lexicon and the grammar. 1 Introduction  An expression is more concise than another expression if it conveys the same amount of information in fewer words. Complex sentences generated by combining clauses are more concise than corresponding simple sentences because multiple references to the recurring entities are removed. For example, clauses like "Jones is a patient" and "Jones has hypertension" can be combined into a more concise sentence "Jones is a hypertensive patient." To illustrate the common occurrence of such repeated enti...

Hybrid Heuristics for Optimal Design of Artificial Neural Networks Designing the architecture and correct parameters for the learning algorithm is a tedious task for modeling an optimal Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which is smaller, faster and with a better generalization performance. In this paper we explain how a hybrid algorithm integrating Genetic algorithm (GA), Simulated Annealing (SA) and other heuristic procedures can be applied for the optimal design of an ANN. This paper is more concerned with the understanding of current theoretical developments of Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANNs) using GAs and how the proposed hybrid heuristic procedures can be combined to produce an optimal ANN. The proposed meta-heuristic can be regarded as a general framework for adaptive systems, that is, systems that can change their connection weights, architectures and learning rules according to different environments without human intervention.

Automatic Discrimination Among Languages Based on Prosody Alone The development of methods for the automatic identification of languages is motivated both by speech-based applications intended for use in a multi-lingual environment, and by theoretical questions of cross-linguistic variation and similarity. We evaluate the potential utility of two prosodic variables, F 0 and amplitude envelope modulation, in a pairwise language discrimination task. Discrimination is done using a novel neural network which can successfully attend to temporal information at a range of timescales. Both variables are found to be useful in discriminating among languages, and confusion patterns, in general, reflect traditional intonational and rhythmic language classes. The methods employed allow empirical determination of prosodic similarity across languages. Die Entwicklung von Methoden zur automatischen Sprachidentifikation wird motiviert sowohl durch sprach-basierte Anwendungen, die zum Einsatz in einer mehrsprachigen Umgebung bestimmt sind, als auch durch theoretisch...

Class Representation and Image Retrieval with Non-Metric Distances One of the key problems in appearance-based vision is understanding how to use a set of labeled images to classify new images. Classification systems that can model human performance, or that use robust image matching methods, often make use of similarity judgments that are non-metric; but when the triangle inequality is not obeyed, most existing pattern recognition techniques are not applicable. We note that exemplar-based (or nearest-neighbor) methods can be applied naturally when using a wide class of non-metric similarity functions. The key issue, however, is to find methods for choosing good representatives of a class that accurately characterize it. We show that existing condensing techniques for finding class representatives are ill-suited to deal with non-metric dataspaces. We then focus on developing techniques for solving this problem, emphasizing two points: First, we show that the distance between two images is not a good measure of how well one image can represent another in non-metric spaces. Instead, we use the vector correlation between the distances from each image to other previously seen images. Second, we show that in non-metric spaces, boundary points are less significant for capturing the structure of a class

Ontology-Related Services in Agent-Based Distributed Information Infrastructures Ontologies are an emerging paradigm to support declarativity, interoperability, and intelligent services in many areas, such as Agent--based Computation, Distributed Information Systems, and Expert Systems. In the context of designing a scalable, agent-based middleware for the realization of distributed Organizational Memories (OM), we examine the question what ontology--related services must be provided as middleware components. To this end, we discuss three basic dimensions of information that have fundamental impact on the usefulness of ontologies for OMs, namely formality, stability, and sharing scope of information. A short discussion of techniques which are suited to find a balance in each of these dimensions leads to a characterization of roles of ontology--related actors in the OM scenario. We describe the several roles with respect to their goals, knowledge, competencies, rights, and obligations. These actor classes and the related competencies are candidates to define agent types, speech acts, and standard services in the envisioned OM middleware. 1.

Incremental Code Mobility with XML We demonstrate how XML and related technologies can be used for code mobility at any granularity, thus overcoming the restrictions of existing approaches. By not fixing a particular granularity for mobile code, we enable complete programs as well as individual lines of code to be sent across the network. We define the concept of incremental code mobility as the ability to migrate and add, remove, or replace code fragments (i.e., increments) in a remote program. The combination of fine-grained and incremental mobility achieves a previously unavailable degree of flexibility. We examine the application of incremental and fine-grained code mobility to a variety of domains, including user interface management, application management on mobile thin clients, for example PDAs, and management of distributed documents.

Organisational Abstractions for the Analysis and Design of Multi-Agent Systems Abstract. The architecture of a multi-agent system can naturally be viewed as a computational organisation. For this reason, we believe organisational abstractions should play a central role in the analysis and design of such systems. To this end, the concepts of agent roles and role models are increasingly being used to specify and design multi-agent systems. However, this is not the full picture. In this paper we introduce three additional organisational concepts ‚Äî organisational rules, organisational structures, and organisational patterns ‚Äî that we believe are necessary for the complete specification of computational organisations. We view the introduction of these concepts as a step towards a comprehensive methodology for agent-oriented systems. 1

Dynamic Reconfiguration in Collaborative Problem Solving In this article we will describe our research efforts in coping with a trade-off that can be often found in the control and optimization of todays business processes. Though centralized control may achieve nearto -optimum results in optimizing the system behavior, there are usually social, technical and security restrictions on applying centralized control. Distributed control on the other hand may cope with these restrictions but also entails sub-optimality and communicational overhead.

Combining Multiple Learning Strategies for Effective Cross Validation Parameter tuning through cross-validation  becomes very difficult when the validation  set contains no or only a few examples of  the classes in the evaluation set. We address  this open challenge by using a combination  of classifiers with different performance  characteristics to effectively reduce the performance  variance on average of the overall  system across all classes, including those  not seen before. This approach allows us to  tune the combination system on available but  less-representative validation data and obtain  smaller performance degradation of this  system on the evaluation data than using a  single-method classifier alone. We tested this  approach by applying k-Nearest Neighbor,  Rocchio and Language Modeling classifiers  and their combination to the event tracking  problem in the Topic Detection and Tracking  (TDT) domain, where new classes (events)  are created constantly over time, and representative  validation sets for new classes are  often difficult to ob...

Web Metasearch as Belief Aggregation Web metasearch requires a mechanism for combining rank-ordered lists of ratings returned by multiple search engines in response to a given user query. We view this as being analogous to the need for combining degrees of belief in probabilistic and uncertain reasoning in artificial intelligence. This paper describes a practical method for performing web metasearch based on a novel transformationbased theory of belief aggregation.

We describe algorithms for real-time synthesis of realistic sound effects for interactive simulations (e.g., games) and animation. These sound effects are produced automatically, from 3D models using dynamic simulation and user interaction. We develop algorithms that are efficient, physicallybased, and can be controlled by users in natural ways. We develop effective techniques for producing high quality continuous contact sounds from dynamic simulations running at video rates which are slow relative to audio synthesis. We accomplish this using modal models driven by contact forces modeled at audio rates, which are much higher than the graphics frame rate. The contact forces can be computed from simulations or can be custom designed. We demonstrate the effectiveness with complex realistic simulations.

Analysis of Approximate Nearest Neighbor Searching with Clustered Point Sets this paper we study the performance of two other splitting methods, and compare them against the kd-tree splitting method. The first, called slidingmidpoint, is a splitting method that was introduced by Mount and Arya in the ANN library for approximate nearest neighbor searching [30]. This method was introduced into the library in order to better handle highly clustered data sets. We know of no analysis (empirical or theoretical) of this method. This method was designed as a simple technique for addressing one of the most serious flaws in the standard kd-tree splitting method. The flaw is that when the data points are highly clustered in low dimensional subspaces, then the standard kd-tree splitting method may produce highly elongated cells, and these can lead to slow query times. This splitting method starts with a simple midpoint split of the longest side of the cell, but if this split results in either subcell containing no data points, it translates (or "slides") the splitting plane in the direction of the  points until hitting the first data point. In Section 3.1 we describe this splitting method and analyze some of its properties. The second splitting method, called minimum-ambiguity, is a query-based technique. The tree is given not only the data points, but also a collection of sample query points, called the training points. The algorithm applies a greedy heuristic to build the tree in an attempt to minimize the expected query time on the training points. We model query processing as the problem of eliminating data points from consideration as the possible candidates for the nearest neighbor. Given a collection of query points, we can model any stage of the nearest neighbor algorithm as a bipartite graph, called the candidate graph, whose vertices correspond t...

Relational Learning Techniques for Natural Language Information Extraction The recent growth of online information available in the form of natural language documents creates a greater need for computing systems with the ability to process those documents to simplify access to the information. One type of processing appropriate for many tasks is information extraction, a type of text skimming that retrieves specific types of information from text. Although information extraction systems have existed for two decades, these systems have generally been built by hand and contain domain specific information, making them difficult to port to other domains. A few researchers have begun to apply machine learning to information extraction tasks, but most of this work has involved applying learning to pieces of a much larger system. This paper presents a novel rule representation specific to natural language and a learning system, Rapier, which learns information extraction rules. Rapier takes pairs of documents and filled templates indicating the information to be ext...

Key Instructions: Solving the Code Location Problem for Optimized Code There are many difficulties to be overcome in the process of designing and implementing a debugger for optimized code. One of the first problems facing the designer of such a debugger is determining how to accurately map between locations in the source program and locations in the corresponding optimized binary. The solution to this problem is critical for many aspects of debugger design, from setting breakpoints, to implementing single-stepping, to reporting error locations. Previous approaches to debugging optimized code have presented many different techniques for solving this location mapping problem (commonly known as the code location problem). These techniques are often very complex and sometimes incomplete.  Identifying key instructions allows for a simple yet formal way of mapping between locations in the source program and the optimized target program. In this paper we present the concept of key instructions. We give a formal definition of key instructions and present algorit...

A Data Model and Data Structures for Moving Objects Databases We consider spatio-temporal databases supporting spatial objects with continuously  changing position and extent, termed moving objects databases. We formally  define a data model for such databases that includes complex evolving spatial  structures such as line networks or multi-component regions with holes. The data  model is given as a collection of data types and operations which can be plugged  as attribute types into any DBMS data model (e.g. relational, or object-oriented)  to obtain a complete model and query language. A particular novel concept is the  sliced representation which represents a temporal development as a set of units,  where unit types for spatial and other data types represent certain "simple" functions  of time. We also show how the model can be mapped into concrete physical  data structures in a DBMS environment.  1 Introduction  A wide and increasing range of database applications has to deal with spatial objects whose position and/or extent changes over time...

Time Series Segmentation for Context Recognition in Mobile Devices Recognizing the context of use is important in making mobile devices as simple to use as possible. Finding out what the user's situation is can help the device and underlying service in providing an adaptive and personalized user interface. The device can infer parts of the context of the user from sensor data: the mobile device can include sensors for acceleration, noise level, luminosity, humidity, etc. In this paper we consider context recognition by unsupervised segmentation of time series produced by sensors.  Dynamic programming can be used to find segments that minimize the intra-segment variances. While this method produces optimal solutions, it is too slow for long sequences of data. We present and analyze randomized variations of the algorithm. One of them, Global Iterative Replacement or GIR, gives approximately optimal results in a fraction of the time required by dynamic programming. We demonstrate the use of time series segmentation in context recognition for mobile phone applications.  1

Stable Algorithms for Link Analysis The Kleinberg HITS and the Google PageRank algorithms are eigenvector methods for identifying "authoritative" or "influential" articles, given hyperlink or citation information. That such algorithms should give reliable or consistent answers is surely a desideratum, and in [10], we analyzed when they can be expected to give stable rankings under small perturbations to the linkage patterns. In this paper, we extend the analysis and show how it gives insight into ways of designing stable link analysis methods. This in turn motivates two new algorithms, whose performance we study empirically using citation data and web hyperlink data. 1.

Autonomous Evolution of Gaits with the Sony Quadruped Robot A trend in robotics is towards legged robots. One of the issues with legged robots is the development of gaits. Typically gaits are developed manually. In this paper we report our results of autonomous evolution of dynamic gaits for the Sony Quadruped Robot.

In addition to achieving our desired goal of automatically developing gaits these results show that EAs can be used on real robots to evolve non-trivial behaviors. A method...

Infinite-Horizon Policy-Gradient Estimation Gradient-based approaches to direct policy search in reinforcement learning have received  much recent attention as a means to solve problems of partial observability and to avoid some of  the problems associated with policy degradation in value-function methods. In this paper we introduce   GPOMDP, a simulation-based algorithm for generating a biased estimate of the gradient of  the average reward in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) controlled by  parameterized stochastic policies. A similar algorithm was proposed by Kimura, Yamamura, and  Kobayashi (1995). The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires storage of only twice the  number of policy parameters, uses one free parameter   2 [0; 1) (which has a natural interpretation  in terms of bias-variance trade-off), and requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove  convergence of GPOMDP, and show how the correct choice of the parameter   is related to the  mixing time of the controlled POMDP. We briefly describe extensions of GPOMDP to controlled  Markov chains, continuous state, observation and control spaces, multiple-agents, higher-order  derivatives, and a version for training stochastic policies with internal states. In a companion paper  (Baxter, Bartlett, & Weaver, 2001) we show how the gradient estimates generated by GPOMDP  can be used in both a traditional stochastic gradient algorithm and a conjugate-gradient procedure  to find local optima of the average reward.

Enabling knowledge representation on the Web by extending RDF Schema Recently, there has been a wide interest in using ontologies on the Web. As a basis for this, RDF Schema (RDFS) provides means to define vocabulary, structure and constraints for expressing metadata about Web resources. However, formal semantics are not provided, and the expressivity of it is not enough for full-fledged ontological modeling and reasoning. In this paper, we will show how RDFS can be extended in such a way that a full knowledge representation (KR) language can be expressed in it, thus enriching it with the required additional expressivity and the semantics of this language. We do this by describing the ontology language OIL as an extension of RDFS. An important advantage of our approach is a maximal backward compatability with RDFS: any meta-data in OIL format can still be partially interpreted by any RDFS-only-processor. The OIL extension of RDFS has been carefully engineered so that such a partial interpretation of OIL meta-data is still correct under the intended semantics of RDFS: simply ignoring the OIL specific portions of an OIL document yields a correct RDF(S) document whose intended RDFS semantics is precisely a subset of the semantics of the full OIL statements. In this way, our approach ensures maximal sharing of meta-data on the Web: even partial interpretation of meta-data by less semantically aware processors will yield a correct partial interpretation of the meta-data. We conclude that our method of extending is equally applicable to other KR formalisms. 1 1

A Comparison of Feature Combination Strategies for Saliency-Based Visual Attention Systems Bottom-up or saliency-based visual attention allows primates to detect non-specific conspicuous targets in cluttered scenes. A classical metaphor, derived from electrophysiological and psychophysical studies, describes attention as a rapidly shiftable "spotlight". The model described here reproduces the attentional scanpaths of this spotlight: Simple multi-scale "feature maps" detect local spatial discontinuities in intensity, color, orientation or optical flow, and are combined into a unique "master" or "saliency" map. The saliency map is sequentially scanned, in order of decreasing saliency, by the focus of attention. We study the problem of combining feature maps, from different visual modalities and with unrelated dynamic ranges (such as color and motion), into a unique saliency map.

Developments in Spatio-Temporal Query Languages In contrast to the field view of spatial data that basically views spatial data as a mapping from points into some features, the object view clusters points by features and their values into spatial objects of type point, line, or region. When embedding these objects into a data model, such as the relational model, an additional clustering according to conceptually identified objects takes place. For example, we could define a relation City(name: string,center: point,area: region) that combines different features for cities in one relation. An important aspect of this kind of modeling is that clustering happens on two different levels: (i) points are grouped into spatial objects like regions and (ii) different attributes/features are grouped into a perceived object. When talking about data modeling there is no reason why this grouping should be limited to two levels. For example, we can consider storing regions of different population densities for each city in an attribute density: num ‚Üí region. Although then the relation is not in first normal form anymore, we can ‚Äúrecover‚Äù the first normal form by encapsulating the function num ‚Üí region in an abstract data type. The important aspect is that all the required operations on such a type as well as on regions and other complex types can be defined to a large degree independently from the data model. 1 The most important point about the preceding discussion is the way in which complex types can be easily

A Layered Approach to Learning Client Behaviors in the RoboCup Soccer Server In the past few years, Multiagent Systems (MAS) has emerged as an active subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Because of the inherent complexity of MAS, there is much interest in using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to help build multiagent systems. Robotic soccer is a particularly good domain for studying MAS and Multiagent Learning. Our approach to using ML as a tool for building Soccer Server clients involves layering increasingly complex learned behaviors. In this article, we describe two levels of learned behaviors. First, the clients learn a low-level individual skill that allows them to control the ball effectively. Then, using this learned skill, they learn a higher-level skill that involves multiple players. For both skills, we describe the learning method in detail and report on our extensive empirical testing. We also verify empirically that the learned skills are applicable to game situations. 1 Introduction  In the past few years, Multiagent Systems (MAS) has emerge...

A Meta-search Method Reinforced by Cluster Descriptors A meta-search engine acts as an agent for the participant search engines. It receives queries from users and redirects them to one or more of the participant search engines for processing. A meta-search engine incorporating many participant search engines is better than a single global search engine in terms of the number of pages indexed and the freshness of the indexes. The meta-search engine stores descriptive data (i.e., descriptors) about the index maintained by each participant search engine so that it can estimate the relevance of each search engine when a query is received. The ability for the meta-search engine to select the most relevant search engines determines the quality of the final result. To facilitate the selection process, the document space covered by each search engine must be described not only concisely but also precisely. Existing methods tend to focus on the conciseness of the descriptors by keeping a descriptor for a search engine 's entire index. This paper proposes to cluster a search engine's document space into clusters and keep a descriptor for each cluster. We show that cluster descriptors can provide a finer and more accurate representation of the document space, and hence enable the meta-search engine to improve the selection of relevant search engines. Two cluster-based search engine selection scenarios (i.e., independent and high-correlation) are discussed in this paper. Experiments verify that the cluster-based search engine selection can effectively identify the most relevant search engines and improve the quality of the search results consequently.  1

Our architecture incorporates a number of proven approaches into the new context of ubiquitous computing. We employ the Bell-LaPadula and capability models to realise access control and adopt Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)-based approaches to provide efficient and authenticated end-to-end security. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our design, we implemented an application enabled with this security architecture and showed that it incurred low latency.

Iterative Information Retrieval Using Fast Clustering and Usage-Specific Genres This paper describes how collection specific empirically defined stylistics based genre prediction can be brought together together with rapid topical clustering to build an interactive information retrieval interface with multi-dimensional presentation of search results. The prototype presented addresses two specific problems of information retrieval: how to enrich the information seeking dialog by encouraging and supporting iterative refinement of queries, and how to enrich the document representation past the shallow semantics allowed by term frequencies.  Searching For More Than Words  Today's tools for searching information in a document database are based on term occurrence in texts. The searcher enters a number of terms and a number of documents where those terms or closely related terms appear comparatively frequently are retrieved and presented by the system in list form. This method works well up to a point. It is intuitively understandable, and for competent users and well e...

Again, important differences between countries may be detected with respect to the expenses produced. For instance, Finland spent 20 times more that Spain on a per capita basis. The forecasts for European buying goods and services for the year 2002 suggest that the current 5.2 million shoppers will increase until 28.8 millions, and the European revenues from the current EUR3,032 million to EUR57,210 million. Finally, a significant increase in the number of European executives that believe in the future of electronic commerce has been observed (33% in 1999 up from 23% in 1998)

Modified Gath-Geva Fuzzy Clustering for Identification of Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Models The construction of interpretable Takagi--Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models by means of clustering is addressed. First, it is shown how the antecedent fuzzy sets and the corresponding consequent parameters of the TS model can be derived from clusters obtained by the Gath--Geva algorithm. To preserve the partitioning of the antecedent space, linearly transformed input variables can be used in the model. This may, however, complicate the interpretation of the rules. To form an easily interpretable model that does not use the transformed input variables, a new clustering algorithm is proposed, based on the Expectation Maximization (EM) identification of Gaussian mixture models. This new technique is applied to two well-known benchmark problems: the MPG (miles per gallon) prediction and a simulated second-order nonlinear process. The obtained results are compared with results from the literature.

blockeel00executing
Executing Query Packs in ILP Inductive logic programming systems usually send large numbers  of queries to a database. The lattice structure from which these queries  are typically selected causes many of these queries to be highly similar. As a consequence, independent execution of all queries may involve a lot of redundant computation. We propose a mechanism for executing a hierarchically  structured set of queries (a "query pack") through which a lot of redundancy in the computation is removed. We have incorporated our  query pack execution mechanism in the ILP systems Tilde and Warmr by implementing a new Prolog engine ilProlog which provides support  for pack execution at a lower level. Experimental results demonstrate  significant efficiency gains. Our query pack execution mechanism is very  general in nature and could be incorporated in most other ILP systems,  with similar efficiency improvements to be expected.

Resolution-Based Proof for Multi-Modal Temporal Logics of Knowledge Temporal logics of knowledge are useful in order to specify complex systems in which agents are both dynamic and have information about their surroundings. We present a resolution method for propositional temporal logic combined with multi-modal S5 and illustrate its use on examples. This paper corrects a previous proposal for resolution in multi-modal temporal logics of knowledge.

For example, logics to formalise multi-agent systems often incorporate a dynamic component representing change of over time; an informational component to capture the agent's knowledge or beliefs; and a motivational component for notions such as goals, wishes, desires or intentions. Often temporal or dynamic logic is used for...

G-Prop-II: Global Optimization of Multilayer Perceptrons using GAs A general problem in model selection is to obtain the right parameters that make a model fit observed data. For a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) trained with Backpropagation (BP), this means finding appropiate layer size and initial weights. This paper proposes a method (G-Prop, genetic backpropagation) that attempts to solve that problem by combining a genetic algorithm (GA) and BP to train MLPs with a single hidden layer. The GA selects the initial weights and changes the number of neurons in the hidden layer through the application of specific genetic operators. G-Prop combines the advantages of the global search performed by the GA over the MLP parameter space and the local search of the BP algorithm. The application of the G-Prop algorithm to several real-world and benchmark problems shows that MLPs evolved using G-Prop are smaller and achieve a higher level of generalization than other perceptron training algorithms, such as QuickPropagation or RPROP, and other evolutive algorithms, s...

Advances in Analogy-Based Learning: False Friends and Exceptional Items in Pronunciation By Paradigm-Driven Analogy When looked at from a multilingual perspective, grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is a challenging task, fraught with most of the classical NLP "vexed questions": bottle-neck problem of data acquisition, pervasiveness of exceptions, difficulty to state range and order of rule application, proper treatment of context-sensitive phenomena and long-distance dependencies, and so on. The hand-crafting of transcription rules by a human expert is onerous and time-consuming, and yet, for some European languages, still stops short of a level of correctness and accuracy acceptable for practical applications. We illustrate here a self-learning multilingual system for analogy-based pronunciation which was tested on Italian, English and French, and whose performances are assessed against the output of both statistically and rule-based transcribers. The general point is made that analogy-based self-learning techniques are no longer just psycholinguistically-plausible models, but competitive tools, combining the advantages of using language-independent, self-learning, tractable algorithms, with the welcome bonus of being more reliable for applications than traditional text-to-speech systems.

Ontobroker: The Very High Idea The World Wide Web (WWW) is currently one of the most important electronic information sources. However, its query interfaces and the provided reasoning services are rather limited. Ontobroker consists of a number of languages and tools that enhance query access and inference service of the WWW. The technique is based on the use of ontologies.  Ontologies are applied to annotate web documents and to provide query access and inference service that deal with the semantics of the presented information. In consequence, intelligent brokering services for web documents can be achieved without requiring to change the semiformal nature of web documents. Introduction  The World Wide Web (WWW) contains huge amounts of knowledge about almost all subjects you can think of.

Market Protocols for Decentralized Supply Chain Formation   In order to effectively respond to changing market conditions, business partners must be able to rapidly form supply chains. This thesis approaches the problem of automating supply chain formation---the process of determining the participants in a supply chain, who will exchange what with whom, and the terms of the exchanges---within an economic framework.  In this thesis, supply chain formation is formalized as task dependency networks. This model captures subtask decomposition in the presence of resource contention---two important and challenging aspects of supply chain formation.  In order to form supply chains in a decentralized fashion, price systems provide an economic framework for guiding the decisions of self-interested agents. In competitive price equilibrium, agents choose optimal allocations with respect to prices, and outcomes are optimal overall. Approximate competitive equilibria yield approximately optimal allocations. Different market protocols are proposed for agents to negotiate the allocation of resources to form supply chains. In the presence of resource contention, these protocols produce better solutions than the greedy protocols common in the artificial intelligence and multiagent systems literature. The first protocol proposed is based on distributed, progressive, price-based auctions, and is analyzed with non-strategic, agent bidding policies. The protocol often converges to high-value supply chains, and when competitive equilibria exist, typically to approximate competitive equilibria. However, complemen- tarities in agent production technologies can cause the protocol to wastefully allocate inputs to agents that do not produce their out...

A Theorem Prover-Based Analysis Tool for Object-Oriented Databases We present a theorem-prover based analysis tool for object-oriented database systems with integrity  constraints. Object-oriented database specifications are mapped to higher-order logic (HOL). This allows  us to reason about the semantics of database operations using a mechanical theorem prover such  as Isabelle or PVS. The tool can be used to verify various semantics requirements of the schema (such as  transaction safety, compensation, and commutativity) to support the advanced transaction models used in  workflow and cooperative work. We give an example of method safety analysis for the generic structure  editing operations of a cooperative authoring system.  1 Introduction  Object-oriented specification methodologies and object-oriented programming have become increasingly important in the past ten years. Not surprisingly, this has recently led to an interest in object-oriented program verification in the theorem prover community, mainly using higher-order logic (HOL). Several dif...

The PicSOM Retrieval System: Description and Evaluations We have developed an experimental system called PicSOM for retrieving images similar to a given set of reference  images in large unannotated image databases. The technique is based on a hierarchical variant of the Self-Organizing  Map (SOM) called the Tree Structured Self-Organizing Map (TS-SOM). Given a set of reference images, PicSOM  is able to retrieve another set of images which are most similar to the given ones. Each TS-SOM is formed using a  different image feature representation like color, texture, or shape. A new technique introduced in PicSOM facilitates  automatic combination of the responses from multiple TS-SOMs and their hierarchical levels. This mechanism adapts  to the user's preferences in selecting which images resemble each other. In this paper, a brief description of the system  and a set of methods applicable to evaluating retrieval performance of image retrieval applications are presented.  1 Introduction  Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) has been a subject...

Embodied Evolution: Embodying an Evolutionary Algorithm in a Population of Robots We introduce Embodied Evolution (EE) as a methodology for the automatic design of robotic controllers. EE is an evolutionary robotics (ER) technique that avoids the pitfalls of the simulate-and-transfer method, allows the speed-up of evaluation time by utilizing parallelism, and is particularly suited to future work on multi-agent behaviors. In EE, an evolutionary algorithm is distributed amongst and embodied within a population of physical robots that reproduce with one another while situated in the task environment. We have built a population of eight robots and successfully implemented our first experiments. The controllers evolved by EE compare favorably to hand-designed solutions for a simple task. We detail our methodology, report our initial results, and discuss the application of EE to more advanced and distributed robotics tasks. 1.

CHIME: Customizable Hyperlink Insertion and Maintenance Engine for Software Engineering Environments Source code browsing is an important part of program comprehension. Browsers expose semantic and syntactic relationships (such as between object references and definitions) in GUI-accessible forms. These relationships are derived using tools which perform static analysis on the original software documents. Implementing such browsers is tricky. Program comprehension strategies vary, and it is necessary to provide the right browsing support. Analysis tools to derive the relevant crossreference relationships are often difficult to build. Tools to browse distributed documents require extensive coding for the GUI, as well as for data communications. Therefore, there are powerful motivations for using existing static analysis tools in conjunction with WWW technology to implement browsers for distributed software projects. The chime framework provides a flexible, customizable platform for inserting HTML links into software documents using information generated by existing software analysis tools. Using the chime specification language, and a simple, retargetable database interface, it is possible to quickly incorporate a range of different link insertion tools for software documents, into an existing, legacy software development environment. This enables tool builders to offer customized browsing support with a well-known GUI. This paper describes the chime architecture, and describes our experience with several re-targeting efforts of this system. 1

Word Sense Disambiguation based on Semantic Density This paper presents a Word Sense Disambiguation method based on the idea of semantic density between words. The disambiguation is done in the context of WordNet. The Internet is used as a raw corpora to provide statistical information for word associations. A metric is introduced and used to measure the semantic density and to rank all possible combinations of the senses of two words. This method provides a precision of 58% in indicating the correct sense for both words at the same time. The precision increases as we consider more choices: 70% for top two ranked and 73% for top three ranked.  1 Introduction  Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is an open problem in Natural Language Processing.

Learning-Based Vision and Its Application to Autonomous Indoor Navigation Learning-Based Vision and Its Application to Autonomous Indoor Navigation  By  Shaoyun Chen Adaptation is critical to autonomous navigation of mobile robots.

The major focus of this thesis lies in machine learning for vision-based navigation. Two well known vision-based navigation systems are ALVINN and ROBIN developed by Carnegie-Mellon University and University of Maryland, respectively. ALVINN uses a two-layer feedforward neural network while ROBIN relies on a radial basis function network (RBFN). Although current ANN-based methods have achieved great success in vision-based navigation, they have two major disadvantages: (1) Local minimum problem: The training of either multilayer perceptron or radial basis function network can get stuck at poor local minimums. (2) The flexibility problem: After the system has been trained in certain r...

View-independent Recognition of Hand Postures Since human hand is highly articulated and deformable, hand posture recognition is a challenging example in the research of view-independent object recognition. Due to the difficulties of the modelbased approach, the appearance-based learning approach is promising to handle large variation in visual inputs. However, the generalization of many proposed supervised learning methods to this problem often suffers from the insufficiency of labeled training data. This paper describes an approach to alleviate this difficulty by adding a large unlabeled training set. Combining supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms, a novel and powerful learning approach, the Discriminant-EM (D-EM) algorithm, is proposed in this paper to handle the case of small labeled training set. Experiments show that D-EM outperforms many other learning methods. Based on this approach, we implement a gesture interface to recognize a set o...

Exploiting Structure for Intelligent Web Search Together with the rapidly growing amount of online data we register an immense need for intelligent search engines that access a restricted amount of data as found in intranets or other limited domains. This sort of search engines must go beyond simple keyword indexing/matching, but they also have to be easily adaptable to new domains without huge costs. This paper presents a mechanism that addresses both of these points: first of all, the internal document structure is being used to extract concepts which impose a directorylike structure on the documents similar to those found in classified directories. Furthermore, this is done in an efficient way which is largely language independent and does not make assumptions about the document structure.

Accurately and Reliably Extracting Data from the Web: A Machine Learning Approach A critical problem in developing information agents for the Web is accessing data that is formatted for human use. We have developed a set of tools for extracting data from web sites and transforming it into a structured data format, such as XML. The resulting data can then be used to build new applications without having to deal with unstructured data. The advantages of our wrapping technology over previous work are the the ability to learn highly accurate extraction rules, to verify the wrapper to ensure that the correct data continues to be extracted, and to automatically adapt to changes in the sites from which the data is being extracted.  1 Introduction  There is a tremendous amount of information available on the Web, but much of this information is not in a form that can be easily used by other applications.

The minimum enclosure is approximate: it bounds the minimum area between (1-epsilon)A and A.

Especially the area of information filtering has been proposed for the application of mobile filter agents. However, an effective coordination of agents, which takes into account the current network conditions, is difficult to achieve.  This contribution analyses the situation that data distributed among various remote data servers has to be examined with mobile filter agents.

A Quantification Of Distance-Bias Between Evaluation Metrics In Classification This paper provides a characterization of bias  for evaluation metrics in classification (e.g.,  Information Gain, Gini,   2  , etc.). Our characterization  provides a uniform representation  for all traditional evaluation metrics.  Such representation leads naturally to a measure  for the distance between the bias of  two evaluation metrics. We give a practical  value to our measure by observing if  the distance between the bias of two evaluation  metrics correlates with differences in  predictive accuracy when we compare two  versions of the same learning algorithm that  differ in the evaluation metric only. Experiments  on real-world domains show how  the expectations on accuracy differences generated  by the distance-bias measure correlate  with actual differences when the learning  algorithm is simple (e.g., search for the  best single-feature or the best single-rule).  The correlation, however, weakens with more  complex algorithms (e.g., learning decision  trees). Our results sh...

Yet queries are frequently processed suboptimally due to (1) only coarse or inaccurate estimates of the query characteristics and database statistics available prior to query evaluation; (2) changes in system configuration and resource availability during query evaluation.

Feature Selection in Web Applications By ROC Inflections and Powerset Pruning coetzee,compuman,lawrence,giles¬• A basic problem of information processing is selecting enough features to ensure that events are accurately represented for classification problems, while simultaneously minimizing storage and processing of irrelevant or marginally important features. To address this problem, feature selection procedures perform a search through the feature power set to find the smallest subset meeting performance requirements. Major restrictions of existing procedures are that they typically explicitly or implicitly assume a fixed operating point, and make limited use of the statistical structure of the feature power set. We present a method that combines the Neyman-Pearson design procedure on finite data, with the directed set structure of the Receiver Operating Curves on the feature subsets, to determine the maximal size of the feature subsets that can be ranked in a given problem. The search can then be restricted to the smaller subsets, resulting in significant reductions in computational complexity. Optimizing the overall Receiver Operating Curve also allows for end users to select different operating points and cost functions to optimize. The algorithm also produces a natural method of Boolean representation of the minimal feature combinations that best describe the data near a given operating point. These representations are especially appropriate when describing data using common text-related features useful on the web, such as thresholded TFIDF data. We show how to use these results to perform automatic Boolean query modification generation for distributed databases, such as niche metasearch engines. 1

Following a long tradition in database research, the XML Store Benchmark Project provides a framework to assess an XML database's abilities to cope with a broad spectrum of different queries, typically posed in real-world application scenarios. The benchmark is intended to help both implementors and users to compare XML databases independent of their own, specific application scenario. To this end, the benchmark o ers a set queries each of which is intended to challenge a particular primitive of the query processor or storage engine. The overall workload wepropose consists of a scalable document database and a concise, yet comprehensive set of queries, which covers the major aspects of query processing. The queries' challenges range from stressing the textual character of the document to data analysis queries, but include also typical ad-hoc queries. We complement our research with results obtained from running the benchmark on our XML database platform. They are intended to give a rst baseline, illustrating the state of the art.

Scalable Processing of Read-Only Transactions in Broadcast Push Recently, push-based delivery has attracted considerable attention as a means of disseminating information to large client populations in both wired and wireless settings. In this paper, we address the problem of ensuring the consistency and currency of client read-only transactions in the presence of updates. To this end, additional control information is broadcast. A suite of methods is proposed that vary in the complexity and volume of the control information transmitted and subsequently differ in response times, degrees of concurrency, and space and processing overheads. The proposed methods are combined with caching to improve query latency. The relative advantages of each method are demonstrated through both simulation results and qualitative arguments. Read-only transactions are processed locally at the client without contacting the server and thus the proposed approaches are scalable, i.e., their performance is independent of the number of clients.  1.

Interaction between Path and Type Constraints XML [7], which is emerging as an important standard for data exchange on the World-Wide Web, highlights the importance of semistructured data. Although the XML standard itself does not require any schema or type system, a number of proposals [6, 17, 19] have been developed that roughly correspond to data definition languages. These allow one to constrain the structure of XML data by imposing a schema on it. These and other proposals also advocate the need for integrity constraints, another form of constraints that should, for example, be capable of expressing inclusion constraints and inverse relationships. The latter have recently been studied as path constraints in the context of semistructured data [4, 9]. It is likely that future XML proposals will involve both forms of constraints, and it is therefore appropriate to understand the interaction between them. This paper investigates that interaction. In particular it studies constraint implication problems, which are important both i...

Using Constraint Satisfaction for View Update Translation View update is the problem of translating update requests against a view into update requests against the base data. In this paper, we present a novel approach to this problem in relational databases. Using conditional tables to represent relational views, we translate a view update problem into a disjunction of a number of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Solutions to the CSPs correspond to possible translations of the view update. Semantic information to resolve ambiguity can be handled as additional constraints in the CSPs. This approach enables us to apply the rich results of the CSP research to analyze and solve an important problem in database management.

An Open Electronic Marketplace through Agent-based Workflows: MOPPET We propose an electronic marketplace architecture, called MOPPET, where the commerce processes in the marketplace are modeled as adaptable agent-based workflows. The higher level of abstraction provided by the workflow technology makes the customization of electronic commerce processes for different users possible. Agent-based implementation, on the other hand, provides for a highly reusable component-based workflow architecture as well as negotiation ability and the capability to adapt to dynamic changes in the environment. Agent communication is handled through Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML). A workflow-based architecture also makes it possible for complete modeling of electronic commerce processes by allowing involved parties to be able to invoke already existing applications or to define new tasks and to restructure the control and data flow among the tasks to create custom built process definitions. In the proposed architecture all data exchanges are realized through Extensible Markup Language (XML) providing uniformity, simplicity and a highly open and interoperable architecture. Metadata of activities are expressed through Resource Description Framework (RDF). Common Business Library (CBL) is used for achieving interoperability across business domains and domain specific Document Type Definitions (DTDs) are used for vertical industries. We provide our own specifications for missing DTDs to be replaced by the original specifications when they become available.

Iconics, viewed as iconic signs in the sense of Peirce, are different from deictics and emblems, for their relation to the referent is based on similarity. In the work reported here, the breakdown of the complex notion of similarity provides the key idea towards a computational model of gesture semantics for iconic gestures. Based on an empirical study,we describe first steps towards a recognition model for shape-related iconic gestures and its implementation in a prototype gesture recognition system. Observations are focused on spatial concepts and their relation to features of iconic gestural expressions. The recognition model is based on a graphmatching method which compares the decomposed geometrical structures of gesture and object.

Agora: Enhancing Group Awareness and Collaboration in Floristic Digital Libraries .  Digital libraries can be regarded as virtual spaces in which collaborative scholarly research can be conducted. Floristic digital libraries provide such collaboration spaces for scientists working on solutions for Earth's biodiversity problems. However, group awareness and collaboration are not easily achieved in an increasingly distributed environment such as the virtual space in which digital library users (particularly botanists and biologists) do their work. We describe an environment that enables group awareness, communication, and collaboration among users in a globally accessible floristic digital library. This is achieved by extending existing library facilities with recommendation and alerting services, as well as various communication interfaces.  Keywords: Recommendation services, group awareness, agents, floristic digital libraries.  1.

Supporting Workspace Awareness in Distance Learning Environments: Issues and Experiences in the Development of a Collaborative Learning System In recent years, we have witnessed an enormous growth in networks and related technologies. Course materials are increasingly published on web servers, and students are encouraged to access these at leisure. Distance learning via the WWW shifted the education paradigm from teacher-centered instruction to user-centered collaborative learning. Systems that allow users to learn collaboratively are increasingly interesting to scientific communities and learning organizations. We initially designed and prototyped a collaborative system to support collaborative learning over the Internet. A usability study of the first prototype revealed the importance of awareness information. Our review of three wellknown collaborative systems finds that such systems today also lack support for awareness information, especially workspace awareness. We then consider various types of awareness in collaborative learning situations and set out the design requirements of our system. From these requirements, we have designed and prototyped several awareness widgets for a typical collaborative tool: the shared electronic whiteboard. These widgets help learners maintain awareness of other learners' interactions with the shared workspace.

A Maximum Entropy Language Model Integrating N-Grams And Topic Dependencies For Conversational Speech Recognition A compact language model which incorporates local dependencies in the form of N-grams and long distance dependencies through dynamic topic conditional constraints is presented. These constraints are integrated using the maximum entropy principle. Issues in assigning a topic to a test utterance are investigated. Recognition results on the Switchboard corpus are presented showing that with a very small increase in the number of model parameters, reduction in word error rate and language model perplexity are achieved over trigram models. Some analysis follows, demonstrating that the gains are even larger on content-bearing words. The results are compared with those obtained by interpolating topicindependent and topic-specific N-gram models. The framework presented here extends easily to incorporate other forms of statistical dependencies such as syntactic word-pair relationships or hierarchical topic constraints. 1.

How to Monitor and Control Resource Usage in Mobile Agent Systems The Mobile Agent technology has already shown its advantages, but at the same time has already remarked new problems currently limiting its diffusion in commercial environments. A key issue is to control the operations that foreign mobile agents are authorized to perform on hosting execution environments. It is necessary not only to rule the MA access to resources but also to control resource usage of admitted agents at execution time, for instance to protect against possible denial-of-service attacks. The paper presents a solution framework for the on-line monitoring and control of Java-based MA platforms. In particular, it describes the design and implementation of MAPI, an on-line monitoring component that we have integrated within the SOMA system. The paper shows how to use MAPI as the building block of a distributed monitoring tool that gives application- and kernel-level information about the state of mobile agents and their resource usage, thus enabling the enforcement of management policies on MA resource consumption.  1.

Optimizing Branching Path Expressions Path expressions form the basis of most query languages for semistructured data and XML, specifying  traversals through graph-based data. We consider the query optimization problem for path expressions  that "branch," or specify traversals through two or more related subgraphs; such expressions are  common in nontrivial queries over XML data. Searching the entire space of query plans for branching  path expressions is generally infeasible, so we introduce several heuristic algorithms and postoptimizations  that generate query plans for branching path expressions. All of our algorithms have  been implemented in the Lore database system for XML, and we report experimental results over a variety  of database and query shapes. We compare optimization and execution times across our suite of  algorithms and post-optimizations, and for small queries we compare against the optimal plan produced  by an exhaustive search of the plan space.  1 Introduction  Wo r k i n semistructured data [Abi97, ...

Pedagogical Content Knowledge in a Tutorial Dialogue System to Support Self-Explanation We are engaged in a research project to create a tutorial dialogue system that helps students learn through self-explanation. Our current prototype is able to analyze students' general explanations of their problem-solving steps, stated in their own words, recognize the types of omissions that we often see in these explanations, and provide feedback. Our approach to architectural tradeoffs is to equip the system with a sophisticated NLU component but to keep dialogue management simple. The system has a knowledge-based NLU component, which performed with 81% accuracy in a preliminary evaluation study. The system's approach to dialogue management can be characterised as "classify and react". In each dialogue cycle, the system classifies the student input with respect to a hierarchy of explanation categories that represent common ways of stating complete or incomplete explanations of geometry rules. The system then provides feedback based on that classification. We consider what extensions are necessary or desirable in order to make the dialogues more robust.

CAVEStudy: an Infrastructure for Computational Steering in Virtual Reality Environments We present the CAVEStudy system that enables scientists to interactively steer a simulation from a virtual reality (VR) environment. No modification to the source code is necessary. CAVEStudy allows interactive and immersive analysis of a simulation running on a remote computer. Using a high-level description of the simulation, the system generates the communication layer (based on CAVERNSoft) needed to control the execution and to gather data at runtime.

On the Extension of UML with Use Case Maps Concepts . Descriptions of reactive systems focus heavily on behavioral aspects,  often in terms of scenarios. To cope with the increasing complexity of services  provided by these systems, behavioral aspects need to be handled early in the  design process with flexible and concise notations as well as expressive concepts.  UML offers different notations and concepts that can help describe such  services. However, several necessary concepts appear to be absent from UML,  but present in the Use Case Map (UCM) scenario notation. In particular, Use  Case Maps allow scenarios to be mapped to different architectures composed of  various component types. The notation supports structured and incremental development  of complex scenarios at a high level of abstraction, as well as their  integration. UCMs specify variations of run-time behavior and scenario structures  through sub-maps "pluggable" into placeholders called stubs. This paper  presents how UCM concepts could be used to extend the semantics...

Generating Accurate Rule Sets Without Global Optimization The two dominant schemes for rule-learning, C4.5 and RIPPER, both operate in two stages. First they induce an initial rule set and then they refine it using a rather complex optimization stage that discards (C4.5) or adjusts (RIPPER) individual rules to make them work better together. In contrast, this paper shows how good rule sets can be learned one rule at a time, without any need for global optimization. We present an algorithm for inferring rules by repeatedly generating partial decision trees, thus combining the two major paradigms for rule generation‚Äîcreating rules from decision trees and the separate-and-conquer rule-learning technique. The algorithm is straightforward and elegant: despite this, experiments on standard datasets show that it produces rule sets that are as accurate as and of similar size to those generated by C4.5, and more accurate than RIPPER‚Äôs. Moreover, it operates efficiently, and because it avoids postprocessing, does not suffer the extremely slow performance on pathological example sets for which the C4.5 method has been criticized.

Latent Semantic Indexing by Self-Organizing Map An important problem for the information retrieval from spoken documents is how to extract those relevant documents which are poorly decoded by the speech recognizer. In this paper we propose a stochastic index for the documents based on the Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) of the decoded document contents. The original LSA approach uses Singular Value Decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of the documents. As an alternative, we propose a computationally more feasible solution using Random Mapping (RM) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM). The motivation for clustering the documents by SOM is to reduce the effect of recognition errors and to extract new characteristic index terms. Experimental indexing results are presented using relevance judgments for the retrieval results of test queries and using a document perplexity defined in this paper to measure the power of the index models. 1.

Current approaches consist to use classical programming languages like C or C++ and above all Java which is the most preferred language by agent community thanks to its rich library of functions. The aim of Java is not to design multiagent systems so it does not encompass multiagent features. The aim of this paper is to present a set of characteristics which could be present in an agent-oriented programming language. This paper also describes what kind of multiagent systems could be developed with this set of characteristics.

Primitive-Based Movement Classification for Humanoid Imitation . Motor control is a complex problem and imitation is a powerful mechanism for acquiring new motor  skills. In this paper, we describe perceptuo-motor primitives, a biologically-inspired notion for a basis set of  perceptual and motor routines. Primitives serve as a vocabulary for classifying and imitating observed human  movements, and are derived from the imitator's motor repertoire. We describe a model of imitation based  on such primitives and demonstrate the feasibility of the model in a constrained implementation. We present  approximate motion reconstruction generated from visually captured data of typically imitated tasks taken from  aerobics, dancing, and athletics.  1 Introduction  Imitation is a powerful mechanism for acquiring new skills.

Learning to Refine Case Libraries: Initial Results . Conversational case-based reasoning (CBR) systems, which incrementally extract a query description through a user-directed conversation, are advertised for their ease of use. However, designing large case libraries that have good performance (i.e., precision and querying efficiency) is difficult. CBR vendors provide guidelines for designing these libraries manually, but the guidelines are difficult to apply. We describe an automated inductive approach that revises conversational case libraries to increase their conformance with design guidelines. Revision increased performance on three conversational case libraries. 1 Introduction  In the context of the ECML-97 Workshop entitled Case-Based Learning: Beyond Classification of Feature Vectors, this paper's contribution focuses on using machine learning methods to assist in the design of case libraries.

Specifying Agents with UML in Robotic Soccer The use of agents and multiagent systems is widespread in computer  science nowadays. Thus the need for methods to specify agents in a clear  and simple manner arises.  In this paper we propose an approach to specifying agents with the  help of UML statecharts. Agents are specified on different levels of abstraction.  In addition a method for specifying multiagent plans with explicit  cooperation is shown.

Robotic soccer is an ideal testbed  for research in the fields of robotics and multiagent systems.

Unsupervised Learning of Models for Recognition Abstract. We present a method to learn object class models from unlabeled and unsegmented cluttered scenes for the purpose of visual object recognition. We focus on a particular type of model where objects are represented as flexible constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation and the output of part detectors. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive parts in the training set by applying a clustering algorithm to patterns selected by an interest operator. It then learns the statistical shape model using expectation maximization. The method achieves very good classification results on human faces and rear views of cars. 1 Introduction and Related Work We are interested in the problem of recognizing members of object classes, where we define an object class as a collection of objects which share characteristic features or parts that are visually similar and occur in similar spatial configurations. When building models for object classes of this type, one is faced with three problems (see Fig. 1).

Value-added Mediation in Large-Scale Information Systems Many information-processing tasks can be part of multiple customer applications, as summarizing  stock prices, integrating catolog information from several companies in the same line of business,  predicting the weather, and checking on transportation resources. We assign such sharable services  to an active middleware layer, interposed between clients and servers. We define domain-specific  mediator modules to populate this layer.  Such mediating services must be of value to the customers, so that it will benefit their client  applications to access mediators rather than the server sources directly. Several categories of value  can be considered: improvement in access and coverage, improvement of content, and delegation  of maintenance. We will define criteria for mediating modules: ownership by party who assumes  responsibility for the rseults of the services, domain-specificity to delimit the scope of such a responsibility,  and, of course, conformance with interface standards that ...

Information Extraction via Heuristics for a Movie Showtime Query System Semantic interpretation for limited-domain spoken dialogue systems often amounts to extracting information from utterances. For a system that provides movie showtime information, queries are classified along four dimensions: question type, and movie titles, towns and theaters that were mentioned. Simple heuristics suffice for constructing highly accurate classifiers for the latter three attributes; classifiers for the question type attribute are induced from data using features tailored to spoken language phenomena. Since separate classifiers are used for the four attributes, which are not independent, certain errors can be detected and corrected, thus increasing robustness. 1.

Geometric Foundations for Interval-Based Probabilities The need to reason with imprecise probabilities arises in a wealth of situations ranging from pooling of knowledge from multiple experts to abstraction-based probabilistic planning.

This study provides insight into the sources of the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches to handling probability intervals.

Authoring and Annotation of Web Pages in CREAM Richly interlinked, machine-understandable data constitute the basis for the Semantic Web.  We provide a framework, CREAM, that allows for creation of metadata. While the annotation  mode of CREAM allows to create metadata for existing web pages, the authoring mode lets  authors create metadata --- almost for free --- while putting together the content of a page.  As a particularity of our framework, CREAM allows to create relational metadata, i.e. metadata  that instantiate interrelated definitions of classes in a domain ontology rather than a comparatively  rigid template-like schema as Dublin Core. We discuss some of the requirements one  has to meet when developing such an ontology-based framework, e.g. the integration of a metadata  crawler, inference services, document management and a meta-ontology, and describe its  implementation, viz.

Face Detection Using Mixtures of Linear Subspaces We present two methods using mixtures of linear subspaces for face detection in gray level images. One method uses a mixture of factor analyzers to concurrently perform clustering and, within each cluster, perform local dimensionality reduction. The parameters of the mixture model are estimated using an EM algorithm. A face is detected if the probability of an input sample is above a predefined threshold. The other mixture of subspaces method uses Kohonen‚Äôs self-organizing map for clustering and Fisher Linear Discriminant to find the optimal projection for pattern classification, and a Gaussian distribution to model the class-conditional density function of the projected samples for each class. The parameters of the class-conditional density functions are maximum likelihood estimates and the decision rule is also based on maximum likelihood. A wide range of face images including ones in different poses, with different expressions and under different lighting conditions are used as the training set to capture the variations of human faces. Our methods have been tested on three sets of 225 images which contain 871 faces. Experimental results on the first two datasets show that our methods perform as well as the best methods in the literature, yet have fewer false detects. 1

Probabilistic Frame-Based Systems Two of the most important threads of work in knowledge representation today are frame-based representation systems (FRS's) and Bayesian networks (BNs). FRS's provide an excellent representation for the organizational structure of large complex domains, but their applicability is limited because of their inability to deal with uncertainty and noise. BNs provide an intuitive and coherent probabilistic representation of our uncertainty, but are very limited in their ability to handle complex structured domains. In this paper, we provide a language that cleanly integrates these approaches, preserving the advantages of both. Our approach allows us to provide natural and compact definitions of probability models for a class, in a way that is local to the class frame. These models can be instantiated for any set of interconnected instances, resulting in a coherent probability distribution over the instance properties. Our language also allows us to represent important types of uncertainty tha...

Towards Real-Scale Business Transaction Workflow Modelling While the specification languages of workflow management systems focus on process execution semantics, the successful development of workflows relies on a fuller conceptualisation of business processing, including process semantics. For this, a wellspring of modelling techniques, paradigms and informal-formal method extensions which address the analysis of organisational processing structures (enterprise modelling) and communication (based on speech-act theory), is available. However, the characterisations - indeed the cognition - of workflows still appears coarse. In this paper, we provide the complementary, empirical insight of a real-scale business transaction workflow. The development of the workflow model follows a set of principles which we believe address workflow modelling suitability. Through the principles, advanced considerations including asynchronous as well as synchronous messaging, temporal constraints and a service-oriented perspective are motivated. By illust...

Web Genre Visualization Web users vary widely in terms of their expertise on the topics for which they search, the amount of detail they seek, etc. Unfortunately, today's one-size-fits-all Web search services do not cater to such individual preferences. For example, it is difficult to query for documents that give extensive detail but assume modest prior expertise. We describe how shallow text classification techniques can be used to sort the documents returned by Web search services according to genre dimensions such as level of expertise and amount of detail, and propose a simple visualization interface that helps users rapidly find appropriate documents. (Keywords: document genre; information retrieval, visualisation, text classification, shallow linguistic processing)  Motivation  Consider two users seeking information about Pearson' correlation coefficient.

Achieving Workflow Adaptability by means of Reflection Belief in the importance of business processes has triggered considerable interest in the workflow systems that automate these processes.

Optimal Anytime Search For Constrained Nonlinear Programming In this thesis, we study optimal anytime stochastic search algorithms (SSAs) for solving general constrained nonlinear programming problems (NLPs) in discrete, continuous and mixed-integer space. The algorithms are general in the sense that they do not assume differentiability or convexity of functions. Based on the search algorithms, we develop the theory of SSAs and propose optimal SSAs with iterative deepening in order to minimize their expected search time. Based on the optimal SSAs, we then develop optimal anytime SSAs that generate improved solutions as more search time is allowed. Our SSAs for solving general constrained NLPs are based on the theory of discrete con-strained optimization using Lagrange multipliers that shows the equivalence between the set of constrained local minima (CLMdn) and the set of discrete-neighborhood saddle points (SPdn). To implement this theory, we propose a general procedural framework for locating an SPdn. By incorporating genetic algorithms in the framework, we evaluate new constrained search algorithms: constrained genetic algorithm (CGA) and combined constrained simulated annealing and genetic algorithm (CSAGA).

Formalising the Knowledge Content of Case Memory Systems Discussions of case-based reasoning often reflect an implicit assumption that a case memory system will become better informed, i.e. will increase in knowledge, as more cases are added to the case-base. This paper considers formalisations of this `knowledge content' which are a necessary preliminary to more rigourous analysis of the performance of case-based reasoning systems. In particular we are interested in modelling the learning aspects of case-based reasoning in order to study how the performance of a case-based reasoning system changes as it accumlates problem-solving experience. The current paper presents a `case-base semantics' which generalises recent formalisations of case-based classification. Within this framework, the paper explores various issues in assuring that these sematics are well-defined, and illustrates how the knowledge content of the case memory system can be seen to reside in both the chosen similarity measure and in the cases of the case-base. 1 Introduction ...

Time Series Classification by Boosting Interval Based Literals A supervised classification method for temporal series, even multivariate, is presented. It is based on boosting very simple classifiers: clauses with one literal in the body. The background predicates are based on temporal intervals. Two types of predicates are used: i) relative predicates, such as "increases" and "stays", and ii) region predicates, such as "always" and "sometime", which operate over regions in the dominion of the variable. Experiments on di#erent data sets, several of them obtained from the UCI repositories, show that the proposed method is highly competitive with previous approaches.

Lifelike Gesture Synthesis and Timing for Conversational Agents Besides the inclusion of gesture recognition devices as an intuitive input modality, the synthesis of lifelike gesture is finding growing attention in human-computer interface research. In particular, the generation of synthetic gesture in connection with text-to-speech systems is one of the goals for embodied conversational agents which have become a new paradigm for the study of gesture and for human-computer interface [1]. Embodied conversational agents are computer-generated characters that demonstrate similar properties as humans in face-to-face conversation, including the ability to produce and respond to verbal and nonverbal communication. They may represent the computer in an interaction with a human or represent their human users as &quot;avatars &quot; in a computational environment. In this context, this contribution focusses on an approach for synthesizing lifelike gestures for an articulated virtual agent, with particular emphasis on how to achieve temporal coordination with external information such as the signal generated by a text-to-speech system. The context of this research is the conception of an &quot;articulated communicator &quot; that conducts multimodal dialogue with a human partner in cooperating on a construction task. Gesture production and performance in humans is a complex and multi-stage process.

Using Case-Based Reasoning to Acquire User Scheduling Preferences that Change over Time Production/Manufacturing scheduling typically involves the acquisition of user optimization preferences. The ill-structuredness of both the problem space and the desired objectives make practical scheduling problems difficult to formalize and costly to solve, especially when problem configurations and user optimization preferences change over time. This paper advocates an incremental revision framework for improving schedule quality and incorporating user dynamically changing preferences through Case-Based Reasoning. Our implemented system, called CABINS, records situation-dependent tradeoffs and consequences that result from schedule revision to guide schedule improvement. The preliminary experimental results show that CABINS is able to effectively capture both user static and dynamic preferences which are not known to the system and only exist implicitly in a extensional manner in the case base. 1 Introduction Scheduling deals with allocation of a limited set of resources to a nu...

The Adaptive Agent Architecture: Achieving FaultTolerance Using Persistent Broker Teams Brokers are used in many multi-agent systems for locating agents, for routing and sharing  information, for managing the system, and for legal purposes, as independent third parties.  However, these multi-agent systems can be incapacitated and rendered non-functional when the  brokers become inaccessible due to failures such as machine crashes, network breakdowns, and  process failures that can occur in any distributed software system.  We propose that the theory of teamwork can be used to create robust brokered architectures that  can recover from broker failures, and we present the Adaptive Agent Architecture (AAA) to show  the feasibility of this approach. The AAA brokers form a team with a joint commitment to serve  any agent that registers with the broker team as long as the agent remains registered with the  team. This commitment enables the brokers to substitute for each other when needed. A multiagent  system based on the AAA can continue to work despite broker failures as long...

Incremental and Interactive Sequence Mining The discovery of frequent sequences in temporal databases is an important data mining problem. Most current work assumes that the database is static, and a database update requires rediscovering all the patterns by scanning the entire old and new database. In this paper, we propose novel techniques for maintaining sequences in the presence of a) database updates, and b) user interaction (e.g. modifying mining parameters). This is a very challenging task, since such updates can invalidate existing sequences or introduce new ones. In both the above scenarios, we avoid re-executing the algorithm on the entire dataset, thereby reducing execution time. Experimental results confirm that our approach results in substantial performance gains. 1 Introduction  Sequence mining is an important data mining task, where one attempts to discover frequent sequences over time, of attribute sets in large databases.

For the design problem of discrete codes, which have been used extensively in previous works, we present mostly negative results. We then introduce the notion of continuous codes and cast the design problem of continuous codes as a constrained optimization problem. We describe three optimization problems corresponding to three different norms of the code matrix. Interestingly, for the l 2 norm our formalism results in a quadratic program whose dual does not depend on the length of the code. A special case of our formalism provides a multiclass scheme for building support vector machines which can be solved efficiently. We give a time and space efficient algorithm for solving the quadratic program. We describe preliminary experiments with synthetic data show that our algorithm is often two orders of magnitude faster than standard quadratic programming packages. We conclude with the generalization properties of the algorithm. Keywords: Multiclass categorization,output coding, SVM 1.

Information Seeking as Socially Situated Activity this paper, we discuss implications of situatedness in its social and cultural meaning in the context of information seeking support. We proceed as follows. First, we discuss some of the varying meanings of the term \situated". Then, we outline how we interpret \accounting for situatedness" in the context of information seeking support. Finally, we discuss tools that implement aspects of what we consider important in this context.

Feature Subset Selection Using A Genetic Algorithm Practical pattern classification and knowledge discovery problems require selection of a subset of attributes or features (from a much larger set) to represent the patterns to be classified. This paper presents an approach to the multi-criteria optimization problem of feature subset selection using a genetic algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of this approach for feature subset selection in the automated design of neural networks for pattern classification and knowledge discovery. 1 Introduction Many practical pattern classification tasks (e.g., medical diagnosis) require learning of an appropriate classification function that assigns a given input pattern (typically represented using a vector of attribute or feature values) to one of a finite set of classes. The choice of features, attributes, or measurements used to represent patterns that are presented to a classifier affect (among other things): ffl The accuracy of the classification function that can be learn...

Personality-Driven Social Behaviors in Believable Agents Agents are considered "believable" when they are viewed by an audience as endowed with thoughts, desires, and emotions, typical of different personalities. The paper describes our work in progress aimed at realizing believable agents that perform helping behaviors influenced by their own personalities; the latter are represented as different clusters of prioritized goals and preferences over plans for achieving the goals. The implementation is based on the integration of a statebased planner that serves as the reasoning tool for the agents and a situation-driven execution system. Introduction  "There is a notion in the Arts of `believable character '. It does not mean an honest or reliable character, but one that provides the illusion of life, and thus permits the audience's suspension of disbelief  1  . The idea of believability has long been studied and explored in literature, theater, film, radio, drama, and other media ". (Bates 1994) Believability therefore refers to a character's...

Multivariate Information Bottleneck The Information bottleneck method is an unsupervised  non-parametric data organization technique.  Given a joint distribution P (A; B), this  method constructs a new variable T that extracts  partitions, or clusters, over the values of A that  are informative about B. The information bottleneck  has already been applied to document  classification, gene expression, neural code, and  spectral analysis. In this paper, we introduce  a general principled framework for multivariate  extensions of the information bottleneck method.  This allows us to consider multiple systems of  data partitions that are inter-related. Our approach  utilizes Bayesian networks for specifying  the systems of clusters and what information  each captures. We show that this construction  provides insight about bottleneck variations  and enables us to characterize solutions of these  variations. We also present a general framework  for iterative algorithms for constructing solutions,  and apply it to several examples.

Automatic I/O Hint Generation through Speculative Execution Aggressive prefetching is an effective technique for reducing the execution times of disk-bound applications; that is, applications that manipulate data too large or too infrequently used to be found in file or disk caches. While automatic prefetching approaches based on static analysis or historical access patterns are effective for some workloads, they are not as effective as manually-driven (programmer-inserted) prefetching for applications with irregular or input-dependent access patterns. In this paper, we propose to exploit whatever processor cycles are left idle while an application is stalled on I/O by using these cycles to dynamically analyze the application and predict its future I/O accesses. Our approach is to speculatively pre-execute the application's code in order to discover and issue hints for its future read accesses. Coupled with an aggressive hint-driven prefetching system, this automatic approach could be applied to arbitrary applications, and should be particularl...

Aliasing on the World Wide Web: Prevalence and Performance Implications Aliasing occurs in Web transactions when requests containing different URLs elicit replies containing identical data payloads. Aliasing can cause cache misses, and there is reason to suspect that offthe -shelf Web authoring tools might increase aliasing on the Web. Existing research literature, however, says little about the prevalence of aliasing in user-initiated transactions or its impact on endto -end performance in large multi-level cache hierarchies.

Building Intelligent Systems For Mining Information Extraction Rules From Web Pages By Using Domain Knowledge Previous researches on automatic information extraction experienced difficulties in acquiring and representing useful domain knowledge and in coping with the structural heterogeneity among different information sources. As a result, many real-world information sources with complex document structures could not be correctly analyzed. In order to resolve these problems, this paper presents a method of building intelligent systems for mining information extraction rules from semi-structured Web pages by using domain knowledge. This system automatically generates a wrapper for each information source and performs information extraction and information integration by applying this wrapper to the corresponding source. Both the domain knowledge and the wrapper are represented by XML documents to increase flexibility and interoperability. By testing our prototype system on several real-estate information sites, we can claim that it creates the correct wrappers for most Web sources and consequently facilitates effective information extraction for heterogeneous information sources.  1.

Using Models of Score Distributions in Information Retrieval Empirical modeling of a number of different text search engines shows that the score distributions on a per query basis may be fitted approximately using an exponential distribution for the set of nonrelevant documents and a normal distribution for the set of relevant documents. This model fits not only probabilistic search engines like INQUERY but also vector space search engines like SMART and also LSI search engines. The model also appears to be true of search engines operating on a number of different languages. This leads to the hypothesis that all 'good' text search engines operating on any language have similar characteristics. The question then arises as to whether the shape of the score distributions reflects some underlying model of language or the search process itself. We discuss how they arise given certain assumptions about word distributions in documents. We then show that given a query for which relevance information is not available, a mixture model consisting of an exponential and a normal distribution can be fitted to the score distribution. These distributions can be used to map the scores of a search engine to probabilities. This model has many possible applications. For example, the outputs of different search engines can be combined by averaging the probabilities (optimal if the search engines are independent) or by using the probabilities to select the best engine for each query. Results show that the technique performs as well as the best current combination techniques. A number of different IR tasks may benefit from score modeling including filtering, multi-lingual retrieval and relevance feedback. We also discuss possible future improvements to the process of score modeling. 1.

An Extended Entity-Relationship Approach to Data Management in Object-Oriented Systems Database programming in object-oriented systems can be supported by combining data  modelling and programming technologies such that a data model supports the management of  collections of objects where those objects are as specified by the underlying object-oriented programming  language. This approach is the basis of the object data management services (ODMS)  of the Comandos system. The ODMS data model provides constructs for the representation of  both entities and their relationships and further supports rich classification structures. To complement  the structural model, there is an operational model based on an algebra over collections  of objects.  1 Introduction  Object-oriented technologies are gaining in popularity as the basis for software development platforms. Meanwhile the family of entity-relationship data models retain their wide-spread use and popularity for conceptual modelling.

Path Planning Using Lazy PRM This paper describes a new approach to probabilistic roadmap planners (PRMs). The overall theme of the algorithm, called Lazy PRM, is to minimize the number of collision checks performed during planning and hence minimize the running time of the planner. Our algorithm builds a roadmap in the configuration space, whose nodes are the user-defined initial and goal configurations and a number of randomly generated nodes. Neighboring nodes are connected by edges representing paths between the nodes. In contrast with PRMs, our planner initially assumes that all nodes and edges in the roadmap are collision-free, and searches the roadmap at hand for a shortest path between the initial and the goal node. The nodes and edges along the path are then checked for collision. If a collision with the obstacles occurs, the corresponding nodes and edges are removed from the roadmap. Our planner either finds a new shortest path, or first updates the roadmap with new nodes and edges, and then searches for a shortest path. The above process is repeated until a collision-free path is returned.

Multi-Agent Architectures as Organizational Structures A Multi-Agent System (MAS) is an organization of coordinated autonomous agents that interact in order to achieve particular, possible common goals. Considering real world organizations as an analogy, this paper proposes architectural styles for MAS which adopt concepts from organizational theories. The styles are modeled using the i* framework which o#ers the notions of actor, goal and actor dependency and specified in Formal Tropos. They are evaluated with respect to a set of software quality attributes, such as predictability or adaptability. In addition, we conduct a comparative study of organizational and conventional software architectures using the mobile robot control example from the Software Engineering literature. The research is conducted in the context of Tropos, a comprehensive software system development methodology.

A Unifying Approach to HTML Wrapper Representation and Learning . The number, the size, and the dynamics of Internet information  sources bears abundant evidence of the need for automation in information  extraction. This calls for representation formalisms that match  the World Wide Web reality and for learning approaches and learnability  results that apply to these formalisms.  The concept of elementary formal systems is appropriately generalized to  allow for the representation of wrapper classes which are relevant to the  description of Internet sources in HTML format. Related learning results  prove that those wrappers are automatically learnable from examples.

Probabilistic Default Reasoning with Conditional Constraints We present an approach to reasoning from statistical and subjective knowledge, which is based on a combination of probabilistic reasoning from conditional constraints with approaches to default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases. More precisely, we introduce the notions of -, lexicographic, and conditional entailment for conditional constraints, which are probabilistic generalizations of Pearl's entailment in system    , Lehmann's lexicographic entailment, and Geffner's conditional entailment, respectively. We show that the new formalisms have nice properties. In particular, they show a similar behavior as referenceclass reasoning in a number of uncontroversial examples. The new formalisms, however, also avoid many drawbacks of reference-class reasoning. More precisely, they can handle complex scenarios and even purely probabilistic subjective knowledge as input. Moreover, conclusions are drawn in a global way from all the available knowledge as a whole. We then show that the new formalisms also have nice general nonmonotonic properties. In detail, the new notions of -, lexicographic, and conditional entailment have similar properties as their classical counterparts. In particular, they all satisfy the rationality postulates proposed by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, and they have some general irrelevance and direct inference properties. Moreover, the new notions of - and lexicographic entailment satisfy the property of rational monotonicity. Furthermore, the new notions of -, lexicographic, and conditional entailment are proper generalizations of both their classical counterparts and the classical notion of logical entailment for conditional constraints. Finally, we provide algorithms for reasoning under the new formalisms, and we analyze its computational com...

Updating Extended Logic Programs through Abduction . This paper introduces techniques for updating knowledge bases represented in extended logic programs. Three di#erent types of updates, view updates, theory updates, and inconsistency removal, are considered. We formulate these updates through abduction, and provide methods for computing them with update programs. An update program is an extended logic program which specifies changes on abductive hypotheses, then updates are computed by the U-minimal answer sets of an update program. The proposed technique provides a uniform framework for these di#erent types of updates, and each update is computed using existing procedures of logic programming. 1 Introduction A knowledge base must be updated when new information arrives. There are three cases in updating a knowledge base. The first one is that a knowledge base contains two di#erent kinds of knowledge --- variable knowledge and invariable knowledge. In this case, updates are permitted only on variable knowledge. Updates on the invari...

Building Intelligent Agents for Web-Based Tasks: A Theory-Refinement Approach We present and evaluate an infrastructure with which to rapidly and easily build intelligent software agents for Web-based tasks. Our design is centered around two basic functions: ScoreThisLink  and ScoreThisPage. If given highly accurate such functions, standard heuristic search would lead to efficient retrieval of useful information. Our approach allows users to tailor our system 's behavior by providing approximate advice about the above functions. This advice is mapped into neural network implementations of the two functions. Subsequent reinforcements from the Web (e.g., dead links) and any ratings of retrieved pages that the user wishes to provide are, respectively, used to refine the link- and page-scoring functions. Hence, our agent architecture provides an appealing middle ground between nonadaptive "agent" programming languages and systems that solely learn user preferences from the user's ratings of pages.

A Vision for Management of Complex Models Many problems encountered when building applications of database systems involve the manipulation of models. By ‚Äúmodel, ‚Äù we mean a complex structure that represents a design artifact, such as a relational schema, object-oriented interface, UML model, XML DTD, web-site schema, semantic network, complex document, or software configuration. Many uses of models involve managing changes in models and transformations of data from one model into another. These uses require an explicit representation of ‚Äúmappings ‚Äù between models. We propose to make database systems easier to use for these applications by making ‚Äúmodel ‚Äù and ‚Äúmodel mapping ‚Äù first-class objects with special operations that simplify their use. We call this capability model management. In addition to making the case for model management, our main contribution is a sketch of a proposed data model. The data model consists of formal, object-oriented structures for representing models and model mappings, and of high-level algebraic operations on those structures, such as matching, differencing, merging, function application, selection, inversion and instantiation. We focus on structure and semantics, not implementation. 1

A Multidimentional Framework for the Evaluation of Multiagent System Methodologies Because of the great interest in using multiagent systems (MAS) in a wide variety of applications in recent years, agent-oriented methodologies and related modeling techniques have become a priority for the development of large scale agent-based systems. The work we present here belongs to the disciplines of Software Engineering and Distributed Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, we are interested in software engineering aspects involved in the development of multiagent systems (MAS). Several methodologies have been proposed for the development of MAS. For the most part, these methodologies remain incomplete: they are either an extension of object-oriented methodologies or an extension of knowledge-based methodologies. In addition, too little effort has gone into the standardization of MAS methodologies, platforms and environments. It seems obvious, therefore, that software engineering aspects of the development of MAS still remains an open field. The success of the agent paradigm requires systematic methodologies for the specification, analysis and design of "non toy" MAS applications. We present in this paper a new framework called MUCCMAS, which stands for MUltidimensional framework of Criteria for the Comparison of MAS methodologies, that enabled us to make a comparative analysis of existing main MAS methodologies.

Is Machine Colour Constancy Good Enough? . This paper presents a negative result: current machine colour constancy algorithms are not good enough for colour-based object recognition. This result has surprised us since we have previously used the better of these algorithms successfully to correct the colour balance of images for display. Colour balancing has been the typical application of colour constancy, rarely has it been actually put to use in a computer vision system, so our goal was to show how well the various methods would do on an obvious machine colour vision task, namely, object recognition. Although all the colour constancy methods we tested proved insufficient for the task, we consider this an important finding in itself. In addition we present results showing the correlation between colour constancy performance and object recognition performance, and as one might expect, the better the colour constancy the better the recognition rate. 1 Introduction We set out to show that machine colour constancy had matured to...

Rigid and Articulated Motion Seen with an Uncalibrated Stereo Rig This paper establishes a link between uncalibrated stereo vision and the motion of rigid and articulated bodies. The variation in the projective reconstruction of a dynamic scene over time allows an uncalibrated stereo rig to be used as a faithful motion capturing device. We introduce an original theoretical framework -- projective kinematics -- which allows rigid and articulated motion to be represented within the transformation group of projective space. Corresponding projective velocities are defined in the tangent space. Most importantly, these projective motions inherit the Lie-group structure of the displacement group. These theoretical results lead immediately to nonmetric formulations of visual servoing, tracking, motion capturing and motion synthesis systems, that no longer require the metric geometry of a stereo camera or of the articulated body to be known. We report on such a nonmetric formulation of a visual servoing system and present simulated experimental results.  1 In...

Intelligent Agents -- A New Technology for Future Distributed Sensor Systems? This master thesis deals with intelligent agents and the possibility to use the intelligent agent technology in future distributed sensor systems. The term future distributed sensor system refers to a system based on several sensors that will be developed within a period of five to ten years. Since researchers have not agreed on a more precise definition of intelligent agents, we first examined what constitutes an intelligent agent and made a definition suited for our application domain. We used our definition as a base for investigating if and how intelligent agents can be used in future distributed sensor systems. We argue that it is not interesting to come up with a general agent definition applicable to every agent, instead one should make a foundation for a definition. When this is done we can decide on more specific features depending on the task the agent will perform and in what domain the agent will work in. Finally we conclude that it is possible to use the agent technology i...

Regulating Human-Robot Interaction using "emotions", "drives" and facial expressions This paper presents a motivational system for an autonomous robot which is designed to regulate humanrobot interaction. The mode of social interaction is that of a caretaker-infant dyad where a human acts as the caretaker for the robot. The robot's motivational system is designed to generate an analogous interaction for a robot-human dyad as for an infantcaretaker dyad. An infant's emotions and drives play a very important role in generating meaningful interactions with the caretaker (Bullowa 1979). Similarly, the learning task for the robot is to apply various communication skills acquired during social exchanges to manipulate the caretaker such that its drives are satisfied. Toward this goal, the motivational system implements  drives, emotions, and facial expressions. The interaction is regulated specifically to promote a suitable learning environment. Although the details of the learning itself are beyond the scope of this paper, this work represents an important step toward realiz...

Situated Neuro-Fuzzy Control for Vision-Based Robot Localisation We introduce a neuro-fuzzy system for localising mobile robot solely based on raw vision data without relying on landmarks or artificial symbols. In an initial learning step the system is trained on the compressed input data so as to classify different situations and to associate appropriate behaviours to these situations. Input data may, for example, be generated by an omnidirectional vision system obviating the need for active cameras. At run time the compressed input data are fed into different B-spline fuzzy controllers which determine the correspondence between the actual situation and the situation they were trained for. The matching controller may then directly drive the actuators to realise the desired behaviour. The system thus realises a tight coupling between a very high-dimensional input parameter space and the robot actuators. It is completely free of any internal models such as maps of the environment, the algorithms are straightforward to implement and the computational ...

Efficient Computation of Temporal Aggregates with Range Predicates A temporal aggregation query is an important but costly operation for applications that maintain timeevolving  data (data warehouses, temporal databases, etc.). Due to the large volume of such data, performance  improvements for temporal aggregation queries are critical. In this paper we examine techniques to compute  temporal aggregates that include key-range predicates (range temporal aggregates). In particular we concentrate  on SUM, COUNT and AVG aggregates. This problem is novel; to handle arbitrary key ranges, previous  methods would need to keep a separate index for every possible key range. We propose an approach based  on a new index structure called the Multiversion SB-Tree, which incorporates features from both the SB-Tree  and the Multiversion B-Tree, to handle arbitrary key-range temporal SUM, COUNT and AVG queries. We  analyze the performance of our approach and present experimental results that show its efficiency.  1

More Realistic Human Behavior Models for Agents in Virtual Worlds: Emotion, Stress, and Value Ontologies This paper focuses on challenges to improving the behavioral realism of computer generated agents and attempts to reflect the state of the art in human behavior modeling with particular attention to value  ontologies, emotion, and stress in game-theoretic settings. The goal is to help those interested in constructing more realistic software agents for use in simulations, in virtual reality environments, and in training and performance aiding settings such as on the web or in embedded applications. This paper pursues this goal by providing a framework for better integrating the theories and models contained in the diverse human behavior modeling literatures, such as those that straddle physiological, cognitive and emotive processes; individual differences; emergent group and crowd behavior; and (punctuated) equilibria in social settings. The framework is based on widely available ontologies of world values and how these  and physiological factors might be construed emotively into subjective expected utilities to guide the  reactions and deliberations of agents. For example what makes one set of opponent groups differ from another? This framework serves as an extension of Markov decision processes appropriate for iterative play in game-theoretic settings, with particular emphasis on agent capabilities for redefining drama and for finding meta-games to counter the human player. This article presents the derivation of the framework and some initial results and lessons learned about integrating behavioral models into interactive dramas and meta-games that stimulate (systemic) thought and training doctrine.  1)

Temporal Statement Modifiers A wide range of database applications manage time-varying data. Many temporal query languages have been proposed, each one the result of many carefully made yet subtly interacting design decisions. In this article we advocate a different approach to articulating a set of requirements, or desiderata, that directly imply the syntactic structure and core semantics of a temporal extension of an (arbitrary) nontemporal query language. These desiderata facilitate transitioning applications from a nontemporal query language and data model, which has received only scant attention thus far. The paper then introduces the notion of statement modifiers that provide a means of systematically adding temporal support to an existing query language. Statement modifiers apply to all query language statements, for example, queries, cursor definitions, integrity constraints, assertions, views, and data manipulation statements. We also provide a way to systematically add temporal support to an existing implementation. The result is a temporal query language syntax, semantics, and implementation that derives from first principles. We exemplify this approach by extending SQL-92 with statement modifiers. This extended language, termed ATSQL, is formally defined via a denotational-semantics-style mapping of

Adaptive Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Teams This research addresses the problem of achieving fault tolerant cooperation within small- to medium-sized teams of heterogeneous mobile robots. We describe a novel behavior-based, fully distributed architecture, called ALLIANCE, that utilizes adaptive action selection to achieve fault tolerant cooperative control in robot missions involving loosely coupled tasks. The robots in this architecture possess a variety of high-level functions that they can perform during a mission, and must at all times select an appropriate action based on the requirements of the mission, the activities of other robots, the current environmental conditions, and their own internal states. Since such cooperative teams often work in dynamic and unpredictable environments, the software architecture allows the team members to respond robustly and reliably to unexpected environmental changes and modi cations in the robot team that may occur due to mechanical failure, the learning of new skills, or the addition or removal of robots from the team by human intervention. After presenting ALLIANCE, we describe in detail our experimental results of an implementation of this architecture on a team of physical mobile robots performing a cooperative box pushing demonstration. These experiments illustrate the ability ofALLIANCE to achieve adaptive, fault-tolerant cooperative control amidst dynamic changes in the capabilities of the robot team.

They have proven to be invaluable tools by integrating information from distributed, heterogeneous sources and summarizing this data for use throughout the enterprise. Although the need for information dissemination is as vital in science as in business, working warehouses in this community are scarce because traditional warehousing techniques don't transfer to scientific environments. There are two primary reasons for this difficulty. First, schema integration is more difficult for scientific databases than for business sources, because of the complexity of the concepts and the associated relationships. While this difference has not yet been fully explored, it is an important consideration when determining how to integrate autonomous sources. Second, scientific data sources have highly dynamic data representations (schemata). When a data source participating in a warehouse...

Regression Models for Ordinal Data: A Machine Learning Approach In contrast to the standard machine learning tasks of classification and metric regression we investigate the problem of predicting variables of ordinal scale, a setting referred to as ordinal regression. The task of ordinal regression arises frequently in the social sciences and in information retrieval where human preferences play a major role. Also many multi--class problems are really problems of ordinal regression due to an ordering of the classes. Although the problem is rather novel to the Machine Learning Community it has been widely considered in Statistics before. All the statistical methods rely on a probability model of a latent (unobserved) variable and on the condition of stochastic ordering. In this paper we develop a distribution independent formulation of the problem and give uniform bounds for our risk functional. The main difference to classification is the restriction that the mapping of objects to ranks must be transitive and asymmetric. Combining our theoretical framework with results from measurement theory we present an approach that is based on a mapping from objects to scalar utility values and thus guarantees transitivity and asymmetry. Applying the principle of Structural Risk Minimization as employed in Support Vector Machines we derive a new learning algorithm based on large margin rank boundaries for the task of ordinal regression. Our method is easily extended to nonlinear utility functions. We give experimental results for an Information Retrieval task of learning the order of documents with respect to an initial query. Moreover, we show that our algorithm outperforms more naive approaches to ordinal regression such as Support Vector Classification and Support Vector Regression in the case of more than two ranks.

Designing a Digital Library for Young Children: An Intergenerational Partnership As more information resources become accessible using computers, our digital interfaces to those resources need to be appropriate for all people. However when it comes to digital libraries, the interfaces have typically been designed for older children or adults. Therefore, we have begun to develop a digital library interface developmentally appropriate for young children (ages 5-10 years old). Our prototype system we now call "QueryKids" offers a graphical interface for querying, browsing and reviewing search results.

A Sound Algorithm for Region-Based Image Retrieval Using an Index Region-based image retrieval systems aim to improve the effectiveness of content-based search by decomposing each image into a set of "homogeneous" regions. Thus, similarity between images is assessed by computing similarity between pairs of regions and then combining the results at the image level. In this paper we propose the first provably sound algorithm for performing region-based similarity search when regions are accessed through an index. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, as also compared to alternative retrieval strategies. 1. Introduction  Many real world applications, in the field of medicine, weather prediction, and communications, to name a few, require efficient access to image databases based on content. To this end, the goal of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems is to define a set of properties (features) able to effectively characterize the content of images and then to use such features during retrieval.

A Wearable Spatial Conferencing Space Wearable computers provide constant access to computing and communications resources. In this paper we describe how the computing power of wearables can be used to provide spatialized 3D graphics and audio cues to aid communication. The result is a wearable augmented reality communication space with audio enabled avatars of the remote collaborators surrounding the user. The user can use natural head motions to attend to the remote collaborators, can communicate freely while being aware of other side conversations and can move through the communication space. In this way the conferencing space can support dozens of simultaneous users. Informal user studies suggest that wearable communication spaces may offer several advantages, both through the increase in the amount of information it is possible to access and the naturalness of the interface.  1: Introduction  One of the broad trends emerging in human-computer interaction is the increasing portability of computing and communication fac...

Authoritative Sources in a Hyperlinked Environment The link structure of a hypermedia environment can be a rich source of information about the content of the environment, provided we have effective means for understanding it. Versions of this principle have been studied in the hypertext research community and (in a context predating hypermedia) through journal citation analysis in the field of bibliometrics. But for the problem of searching in hyperlinked environments such as the World Wide Web, it is clear from the prevalent techniques that the information inherent in the links has yet to be fully exploited. In this work we develop a new method for automatically extracting certain types of information about a hypermedia environment from its link structure, and we report on experiments that demonstrate its effectiveness for a variety of search problems on the www.  The central problem we consider is that of determining the relative "authority" of pages in such environments. This issue is central to a number of basic hypertext search t...

Design Issues for Mixed-Initiative Agent Systems This paper addresses the effect of mixed-initiative systems on multiagent systems design. A mixed-initiative system is one in which humans interact directly with software agents in a collaborative approach to problem solving. There are two main levels at which multiagent systems are designed: the domain level and the individual agent level. At the domain level, there are few unique challenges to mixedinitiative system design. However, at the individual agent level, the agent itself must be designed to interact with the human and the agent system, integrating the two into a single system. Introduction  Much of the current research related to intelligent agents has focused on the capabilities and structure of individual agents. However, in order to solve complex problems, these agents must work cooperatively with other agents in a heterogeneous environment. This is the domain of  Multiagent Systems. In multiagent systems, we are interested in the coordinated behavior of a system of indiv...

Symbolic Representation of User-defined Time Granularities In the recent literature on time representation, an effort has been made to characterize the notion of time granularity and the relationships between granularities, in order to have a common framework for their specification, and to allow the interoperability of systems adopting different time granularities. This paper considers the mathematical characterization of finite and periodical time granularities, and it identifies a user-friendly symbolic formalism which captures exactly that class of granularities. This is achieved by a formal analysis of the expressiveness of well-known symbolic representation formalisms. 1. Introduction There is a wide agreement in the AI and database community on the requirement for a data/knowledge representation system of supporting standard as well as user-defined time granularities. Examples of standard time granularities are days, weeks, months, while user defined granularities may include businessweeks, trading-days, working-shifts, school-terms, wi...

Query Optimization in the Presence of Limited Access Patterns 1 Introduction The goal of a query optimizer of a database system is to translate a declarative query expressed on a logical schema into an imperative query execution plan that accesses the physical storage of the data, and applies a sequence of relational operators. In building query execution plans, traditional relational query optimizers try to find the most efficient method for accessing the necessary data. When possible, a query optimizer will use auxiliary data structures such as an index on a file in order to efficiently retrieve a certain set of tuples in a relation. However, when such structures do not exist or are not useful for the given query, the alternative of scanning the entire relation always exists. The existence of the fall back option to perform a complete scan is an important assumption in traditional query optimization. Several recent query processing applications have the common characteristic that it is not always possible to perform complete scans on the data. Instead, the query optimization problem is complicated by the fact that there are only limited access patterns to the data. One such

Text and Image Metasearch on the Web As the Web continues to increase in size, the relative coverage of Web search engines is decreasing, and search tools that combine the results of multiple search engines are becoming more valuable. This paper provides details of the text and image metasearch functions of the Inquirus search engine developed at the NEC Research Institute. For text metasearch, we describe features including the use of link information in metasearch, and provide statistics on the usage and performance of Inquirus and the Web search engines. For image metasearch, Inquirus queries multiple image search engines on the Web, downloads the actual images, and creates image thumbnails for display to the user. Inquirus handles image search engines that return direct links to images, and engines that return links to HTML pages. For the engines that return HTML pages, Inquirus analyzes the text on the pages in order to predict which images are most likely to correspond to the query. The individual image search engin...

Athena: Mining-based Interactive Management of Text Databases Abstract. We describe Athena: a system for creating, exploiting, and maintaining a hierarchy of textual documents through interactive miningbased operations. Requirements of any such system include speed and minimal end-user e ort. Athena satis es these requirements through linear-time classi cation and clustering engines which are applied interactively to speed the development of accurate models. Naive Bayes classi ers are recognized to be among the best for classifying text. We show that our specialization of the Naive Bayes classi er is considerably more accurate (7 to 29 % absolute increase in accuracy) than a standard implementation. Our enhancements include using Lidstone's law of succession instead of Laplace's law, under-weighting long documents, and over-weighting author and subject. We also present a new interactive clustering algorithm, C-Evolve, for topic discovery. C-Evolve rst nds highly accurate cluster digests (partial clusters), gets user feedback to merge and correct these digests, and then uses the classi cation algorithm to complete the partitioning of the data. By allowing this interactivity in the clustering process, C-Evolve achieves considerably higher clustering accuracy (10 to 20 % absolute increase in our experiments) than the popular K-Means and agglomerative clustering methods. 1

Convergence Theory and Applications of the Factorized Distribution Algorithm The paper investigates the optimization of additively decomposable functions (ADF) by a new evolutionary algorithm called Factorized Distribution Algorithm (FDA). FDA is based on a factorization of the distribution to generate search points. First separable ADFs are considered. These are mapped to generalized linear functions with metavariables defined for multiple alleles. The mapping transforms FDA into an Univariate Marginal Frequency Algorithm (UMDA). For UMDA the exact equation for the response to selection is computed under the assumption of proportionate selection. For truncation selection an approximate equation for the time to convergence is used, derived from an analysis of the OneMax function. FDA is also numerically investigated for non separable functions. The time to convergence is very similar to separable ADFs. FDA outperforms the genetic algorithm with recombination of strings by far.  Keywords  response to selection, Fisher's Theorem, additively decomposable functions...

Control Law Design for Haptic Interfaces to Virtual Reality The goal of control law design for haptic displays is to provide a safe and stable user interface while maximizing the operator's sense of kinesthetic immersion in a virtual environment. This paper outlines a control design approach which stabilizes a haptic interface when coupled to a broad class of human operators and virtual environments. Two-port absolute stability criteria are used to develop explicit control law design bounds for two different haptic display implementations: impedance display and admittance display. The strengths and weaknesses of each approach are illustrated through numerical and experimental results for a three degree-offreedom device. The example highlights the ability of the proposed design procedure to handle some of the more difficult problems in control law synthesis for haptics, including structural flexibility and non-collocation of sensors and actuators.

Flex And Pinch: A Case Study Of Whole Hand Input Design For Virtual Environment Interaction We present a discussion of design issues involving whole hand input in virtual environments. In many cases, whole hand input devices limit the types of interaction that the user can perform in the virtual world due to the nature of the device. One possible approach to alleviate these limitations is to provide hybrid input devices which enable the user to combine information generated from two different whole hand input devices.

DLoVe allows programs written in its framework to be executed on multiple computers for  improved performance. It also allows easy specification and implementation of multi-user interfaces. DLoVe hides all the networking aspects of message passing among the machines in the distributed environment and performs the needed network optimizations. As a result, a user of DLoVe does not need to understand parallel and distributed programming to use the system; he or she  needs only be able to use the serial version of the user  interface description language. Parallelizing the computation is performed by DLoVe, without modifying the interface description.

Improving Business Process Quality through Exception Understanding, Prediction, and Prevention Business process automation technologies are  being increasingly used by many companies to  improve the efficiency of both internal processes  as well as of e-services offered to customers. In  order to satisfy customers and employees,  business processes need to be executed with a  high and predictable quality. In particular, it is  crucial for organizations to meet the Service  Level Agreements (SLAs) stipulated with the  customers and to foresee as early as possible the  risk of missing SLAs, in order to set the right  expectations and to allow for corrective actions.  In this paper we focus on a critical issue in  business process quality: that of analyzing,  predicting and preventing the occurrence of  exceptions, i.e., of deviations from the desired or  acceptable behavior. We characterize the  problem and propose a solution, based on data  warehousing and mining techniques. We then  describe the architecture and implementation of a  tool suite that enables exception analysis,  prediction, and prevention. Finally, we show  experimental results obtained by using the tool  suite to analyze internal HP processes.  1.

Formalizing Collaborative Decision-making and Practical Reasoning in Multi-agent Systems In this paper, we present an abstract formal model of decision-making in a social setting that covers all aspects of the process, from recognition of a potential for cooperation through to joint decision. In a multi-agent environment, where self-motivated autonomous agents try to pursue their own goals, a joint decision cannot be taken for granted. In order to decide effectively, agents need the ability to (a) represent and maintain a model of their own mental attitudes, (b) reason about other agents' mental attitudes, and (c) influence other agents' mental states. Social mental shaping is advocated as a general mechanism for attempting to have an impact on agents' mental states in order to increase their cooperativeness towards a joint decision. Our approach is to specify a novel, high-level architecture for collaborative decision-making in which the mentalistic notions of belief, desire, goal, intention, preference and commitment play a central role in guiding the individual agent's and the group's decision-making behaviour. We identify preconditions that must be fulfilled before collaborative decision-making can commence and prescribe how cooperating agents should behave, in terms of their own decision-making apparatus and their interactions with others, when the decision-making process is progressing satisfactorily. The model is formalized through a new, many-sorted, multi-modal logic.

The Inductive Approach to Verifying Cryptographic Protocols Informal arguments that cryptographic protocols are secure can be made rigorous using inductive definitions. The approach is based on ordinary predicate calculus and copes with infinite-state systems. Proofs are generated using Isabelle/HOL. The human e#ort required to analyze a protocol can be as little as a week or two, yielding a proof script that takes a few minutes to run.  Protocols are inductively defined as sets of traces. A trace is a list of communication events, perhaps comprising many interleaved protocol runs. Protocol descriptions incorporate attacks and accidental losses. The model spy knows some private keys and can forge messages using components decrypted from previous tra#c. Three protocols are analyzed below: OtwayRees (which uses shared-key encryption), Needham-Schroeder (which uses public-key encryption), and a recursive protocol [9] (which is of variable length).

The Power of Word Clusters for Text Classification The recently introduced Information Bottleneck method [21] provides an information theoretic framework, for extracting features of one variable, that are relevant for the values of another variable. Several previous works already suggested applying this method for document clustering, gene expression data analysis, spectral analysis and more. In this work we present a novel implementation of this method for supervised text classification. Specifically, we apply the information bottleneck method to find word-clusters that preserve the information about document categories and use these clusters as features for classification. Previous work [1] used a similar clustering procedure to show that word-clusters can significantly reduce the feature space dimensionality, with only a minor change in classification accuracy. In this work we present similar results and go further to show that when the training sample is small word clusters can yield significant improvement in classification accuracy (up to  ¬¢¬°¬§¬£) over the performance using the words directly. 1

The coverage of any one engine is significantly limited: No single engine indexes more than about one-third of the ‚Äúindexable Web, ‚Äù the coverage of the six engines investigated varies by an order of magnitude, and combining the results of the six engines yields about 3.5 times as many documents on average as compared with the results from only one engine.

Motivation-Based Direction of Planning Attention in Agents With Goal Autonomy The action of an agent with goal autonomy will be driven by goals generated with reference to its own beliefs and desires. This ability is essential for agents that are required to act in their own interests in a domain that is not entirely predictable. At any time, the situation may warrant the generation of new goals. However, it is not always the case that changes in the domain that lead to the generation of a goal are detected immediately before the goal should be pursued. Action may not be appropriate for some time. Furthermore, an agent may be influenced by goals that tend to recur periodically, or at particular times of the day or week for example. Such goals serve to motivate an agent towards interacting with other agents or processes with certain types of predictable behaviour patterns. This thesis provides a model of a goal autonomous agent that may generate goals in response to unexpected changes in its domain or cyclically through automatic processes. An important effect of...

Efficiently Computing Weighted Proximity Relationships in Spatial Databases Spatial data mining recently emerges from a number of real applications, such as real-estate marketing, urban planning, weather forecasting, medical image analysis, road traffic accident analysis, etc. It demands for efficient solutions for many new, expensive, and complicated problems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of evaluating the top k distinguished "features" for a "cluster" based on weighted proximity relationships between the cluster and features. We measure proximity in an average fashion to address possible nonuniform data distribution in a cluster. Combining a standard multi-step paradigm with new lower and upper proximity bounds, we presented an efficient algorithm to solve the problem. The algorithm is implemented in several different modes. Our experiment results not only give a comparison among them but also illustrate the efficiency of the algorithm.

Computation of the Semantics of Autoepistemic Belief Theories Recently, one of the authors introduced a simple and yet powerful non-monotonic knowledge representation framework, called the Autoepistemic Logic of Beliefs, AEB. Theories in AEB are called autoepistemic belief theories. Every belief theory  T has been shown to have the least static expansion T which is computed by iterating a natural monotonic belief closure operator \Psi T starting from T . This way, the least static expansion T of any belief theory provides its natural non-monotonic semantics which is called the static semantics.  It is easy to see that if a belief theory T is finite then the construction of its least static expansion T stops after countably many iterations. However, a somewhat surprising result obtained in this paper shows that the least static expansion of any finite belief theory T is in fact obtained by means of a single iteration of the belief closure operator \Psi T (although this requires T to be of a special form, we also show that T can be always put in th...

Partitioning-Based Clustering for Web Document Categorization Clustering techniques have been used by manyintelligent software agents in order to retrieve, lter, and categorize documents available on the World Wide Web. Clustering is also useful in extracting salient features of related web documents to automatically formulate queries and search for other similar documents on the Web. Traditional clustering algorithms either use a priori knowledge of document structures to de ne a distance or similarity among these documents, or use probabilistic techniques such as Bayesian classi cation. Many of these traditional algorithms, however, falter when the dimensionality of the feature space becomes high relative to the size of the document space. In this paper, we introduce two new clustering algorithms that can e ectively cluster documents, even in the presence of a very high dimensional feature space. These clustering techniques, which are based on generalizations of graph partitioning, do not require pre-speci ed ad hoc distance functions, and are capable of automatically discovering document similarities or associations. We conduct several experiments on real Web data using various feature selection heuristics, and compare our clustering schemes to standard distance-based techniques, such ashierarchical agglomeration clustering, and Bayesian classi cation methods, such as AutoClass.

Towards Active Logic Programming In this paper we present the new logic programming language DALI, aimed at defining agents and agent systems. A main design objective for DALI has been that of introducing in a declarative fashion all the essential features, while keeping the language as close as possible to the syntax and semantics of the plain Horn--clause language. Special atoms and rules have been introduced, for representing: external events, to which the agent is able to respond (reactivity); actions (reactivity and proactivity); internal events (previous conclusions which can trigger further activity); past and present events (to be aware of what has happened). An extended resolution is provided, so that a DALI agent is able to answer queries like in the plain Horn--clause language, but is also able to cope with the different kinds of events, and exhibit a (rational) reactive and proactive behaviour. 1 Introduction In this paper we address the issue of defining a logic programming language for reac...

The approach has been developed in order to deliver knowledge required by support-systems for design-tasks.

We employ traces, i.e., protocols of the user's actions when tackling design-tasks as the initial input for incremental knowledge acquisition. This allows to learn task structures to be used for subgoaling and case-bases plus similarity relations applicable to particular case-bases. 1 INTRODUCTION Integrating incremental learning into a knowledge-based systems seems to be a promising way to lessen the burden of knowledge elicitation to system development [9].

Rather, ubiquitous computing strives to increase the responsiveness of the world at large to the individual. A large part of this responsiveness is improved communication with other individuals. In this paper we describe a system that can enable ad--hoc collaboration between several people by creating a model of the daily schedules of individuals and by performing predictions based on this model. Using GPS data we learn to distinguish locations and track the times that these locations are visited. In addition, we use Markov models to predict which locations might be visited next based on the user's previous behavior.

A Genetic Algorithm-Based Solution for the Problem of Small Disjuncts . In essence, small disjuncts are rules covering a small number of  examples. Hence, these rules are usually error-prone, which contributes to a  decrease in predictive accuracy. The problem is particularly serious because,  although each small disjuncts covers few examples, the set of small disjuncts  can cover a large number of examples. This paper proposes a solution to the  problem of discovering accurate small-disjunct rules based on genetic algorithms.  The basic idea of our method is to use a hybrid decision tree / genetic  algorithm approach for classification. More precisely, examples belonging to  large disjuncts are classified by rules produced by a decision-tree algorithm,  while examples belonging to small disjuncts are classified by a new genetic  algorithm, particularly designed for discovering small-disjunct rules.  1 Introduction  In the context of the well-known classification task of data mining, the discovered knowledge is often expressed as a set of IF-THEN predict...

From Declarative Signatures to Misuse IDS In many existing misuse intrusion detection systems, intrusion  signatures are very close to the detection algorithms. As a consequence,  they contain too many cumbersome details. Recent work have  proposed declarative signature languages that raise the level of abstraction  when writing signatures. However, these languages do not always  come with operational support. In this article, we show how to transform  such declarative signatures into operational ones. This process points  out several technical details which must be considered with care when  performing the translation by hand, but which can be systematically  handled.

Building a Large Location Table to Find Replicas of Physics Objects The problem of building a large location table for physics objects occurs within a number of planned physics data management systems, like those that control reclustering and wide-area replication. To satisfy their e#ciency goals, these systems have to make local or remote replicas of individual physics objects, which contain raw or reconstructed data for a single event, rather than replicas of large run or ntuple files. This replication implies the use of a table to resolve the logical, location independent object descriptor into a physical location where an object replica can be found. For modern physics experiments the table needs to scale to at least some 10  10  objects. We argue that such a table can be e#ciently implemented by limiting the freedom of lookup operations, and by exploiting some specific properties of the physics data model. One specific viable implementation is discussed.  Key words: Object location table, object-oriented databases, object clustering,  object re-cl...

Generating a Topically Focused VirtualReality Internet Surveys highlight that Internet users are frequently frustrated by failing to locate useful information, and by difficulty in browsing anarchically linked web-structures. We present a new Internet browsing application (called VR-net) that addresses these problems. It first identifies semantic domains consisting of tightly interconnected web-page groupings. The second part populates a 3D virtual world with these information sources, representing all relevant pages plus appropriate structural relations. Users can then easily browse through around a semantically focused virtual library. 1 Introduction  The Internet is a probably the most significant global information resource ever created, allowing access to an almost unlimited amount of information. In this paper we describe two inter-related difficulties suffered by Internet users, and their combined influence on web use. We then introduce an integrated "search and browse" solution tool that directly tackles both issues. We also examin...

An Adaptive Self-Organizing Color Segmentation Algorithm with Application to Robust Real-time Human Hand Localization In Proc. Asian Conf. on Computer Vision, Taiwan, 2000  This paper describes an adaptive self-organizing color segmentation algorithm and a transductive learning algorithm used to localize human hand in video sequences. The color distribution at each time frame is approximated by the proposed 1-D self-organizing map (SOM), in which schemes of growing, pruning and merging are facilitated to find an appropriate number of color cluster automatically. Due to the dynamic backgrounds and changing lighting conditions, the distribution of color over time may not be stationary. An algorithm of SOM transduction is proposed to learn the nonstationary color distribution in HSI color space by combining supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. Color cue and motion cue are integrated in the localization system, in which motion cue is employed to focus the attention of the system. This approach is also applied to other tasks such as human face tracking and color indexing. Our localization system...

Min-Wise Independent Permutations We define and study the notion of min-wise independent families of permutations. We say that  F #  S n is min-wise independent if for any set X  #  [n] and any x  #  X, when # is chosen at random in  F  we have Pr(min{#(X)} = #(x)) = 1  |X|  . In other words we require that all the elements of any fixed set X have an equal chance to become the minimum element of the image of X under #.  Our research was motivated by the fact that such a family (under some relaxations) is essential to the algorithm used in practice by the AltaVista web index software to detect and filter near-duplicate documents.

Probabilistic Deduction with Conditional Constraints over Basic Events We study the problem of probabilistic deduction with conditional constraints over basic events. We show that globally complete probabilistic deduction with conditional constraints over basic events is NP-hard. We then concentrate on the special case of probabilistic deduction in conditional constraint trees. We elaborate very efficient techniques for globally complete probabilistic deduction. In detail, for conditional constraint trees with point probabilities, we present a local approach to globally complete probabilistic deduction, which runs in linear time in the size of the conditional constraint trees. For conditional constraint trees with interval probabilities, we show that globally complete probabilistic deduction can be done in a global approach by solving nonlinear programs. We show how these nonlinear programs can be transformed into equivalent linear programs, which are solvable in polynomial time in the size of the conditional constraint trees. 1.

Exploring Brick-Based Navigation and Composition in an Augmented Reality . BUILD-IT is a planning tool based on computer vision technology,  supporting complex planning and composition tasks. A group of people, seated  around a table, interact with objects in a virtual scene using real bricks. A plan  view of the scene is projected onto the table, where object manipulation takes  place. A perspective view is projected on the wall. The views are set by virtual  cameras, having spatial attributes like shift, rotation and zoom. However, planar  interaction with bricks provides only position and rotation information. Object  height control is equally constrained by planar interaction. The aim of this paper  is to suggest methods and tools bridging the gap between planar interaction and  three-dimensional control. To control camera attributes, active objects, with intelligent  behaviour are introduced. To control object height, several real and  virtual tools are suggested. Some of the solutions are based on metaphors, like  window, sliding-ruler and floor.  1 I...

On2broker: Semantic-Based Access to Information Sources at the WWW On2broker provides brokering services to improve access to heterogeneous, distributed and semistructured information sources as they are presented in the World Wide Web. It relies on the use of ontologies to make explicit the semantics of web pages. In the paper we will discuss the general architecture and main components of On2broker and provide some application scenarios.  1.

Semantic Approaches to Structuring and Querying Web Sites In order to pose effective queries to Web sites, some form of site data model must be implicitly or explicitly shared by users. Many approaches try to compensate for the lack of such a common model by considering the hypertextual structure of Web sites; unfortunately, this structure has usually little to do with data semantics. In this paper a different technique is proposed that allows for both navigational and logical/conceptual description of Web sites. The data model is based on WG-log, a query language based on the graph-oriented database model of GOOD [Gys94] and G-log [Par95], which allows the description of data manipulation primitives via (sets of) graph(s). The WG-log description of a Web site schema is lexically based on standard hypermedia design languages, thus allowing for easy schema generation by current hypermedia authoring environments. The use of WG-log for queries allows graphic query construction with respect to both the navigational and the logical parts of schema...

Automatic Labeling of Document Clusters Automatically labeling document clusters with words which indicate their topics is difficult to do well. The most commonly used method, labeling with the most frequent words in the clusters, ends up using many words that are virtually void of descriptive power even after traditional stop words are removed. Another method, labeling with the most predictive words, often includes rather obscure words. We present two methods of labeling document clusters motivated by the model that words are generated by a hierarchy of mixture components of varying generality. The first method assumes existence of a document hierarchy (manually constructed or resulting from a hierarchical clustering algorithm) and uses a 2 test of significance to detect different word usage across categories in the hierarchy. The second method selects words which both occur frequently in a cluster and effectively discriminate the given cluster from the other clusters. We compare these methods on abstracts of documents sel...

RDF Based Architecture for Semantic Integration of Heterogeneous Information Sources . The proposed integration architecture aims at exploiting data semantics in order to provide a coherent and meaningful (with respect to a given conceptual model) view of the integrated heterogeneous information sources. The architecture is split into five separate layers to assure modularization, providing description, requirements, and interfaces for each. It favors the lazy retrieval paradigm over the data warehousing approach. The novelty of the architecture lies in the combination of semantic and on-demand driven retrieval. This line of attack offers several advantages but brings also challenges, both of which we discuss with respect to RDF, the architecture's underlying model. 1 Introduction, Background, and Related Work  With the vast expansion of the World Wide Web during the last few years the integration of heterogeneous information sources has become a hot topic.

Comparing Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in DataBases: An Application to Knowledge Discovery in Texts INTRODUCTION  KDD is better known by the oversimplified name of Data Mining (DM). Actually, most academics are rather interested by DM which develops methods for extracting knowledge from a given set of data. Industrialists and experts should be more interested in KDD which comprises the whole process of data selection, data cleaning, transfer to a DM technique, applying the DM technique, validating the results of the DM technique, and finally interpreting them for the user. In general, this process is a cycle that improves under the criticism of the expert.  Machine Learning (ML) and KDD have in common a very strong link : they both acknowledge the importance of induction as a normal way of thinking, while other scientific fields are reluctant to accept it, to say the least. We shall first explore this common point.

Learning Probabilistic Relational Models A large portion of real-world data is stored in commercial relational database systems. In contrast, most statistical learning methods work only with &quot;flat &quot; data representations. Thus, to apply these methods, we are forced to convert our data into a flat form, thereby losing much of the relational structure present in our database. This paper builds on the recent work on probabilistic relational models (PRMs), and describes how to learn them from databases. PRMs allow the properties of an object to depend probabilistically both on other properties of that object and on properties of related objects. Although PRMs are significantly more expressive than standard models, such as Bayesian networks, we show how to extend well-known statistical methods for learning Bayesian networks to learn these models. We describe both parameter estimation and structure learning ‚Äî the automatic induction of the dependency structure in a model. Moreover, we show how the learning procedure can exploit standard database retrieval techniques for efficient learning from large datasets. We present experimental results on both real and synthetic relational databases. 1

A New Approach to Developing and Implementing Eager Database Replication Protocols Database replication is traditionally seen as a way to increase the availability and performance of distributed databases. Although a large number of protocols providing data consistency and fault-tolerance have been proposed, few of these ideas have ever been used in commercial products due to their complexity and performance implications. Instead, current products allow inconsistencies and often resort to centralized approaches which eliminates some of the advantages of replication. As an alternative, we propose a suite of replication protocols that addresses the main problems related to database replication. On the one hand, our protocols maintain data consistency and the same transactional semantics found in centralized systems. On the other hand, they provide flexibility and reasonable performance. To do so, our protocols take advantage of the rich semantics of group communication primitives and the relaxed isolation guarantees provided by most databases. This allows us to eliminate the possibility of deadlocks, reduce the message overhead and increase performance. A detailed simulation study shows the feasibility of the approach and the flexibility with which different types of bottlenecks can be circumvented.

Automatic Discovery of Language Models for Text Databases The proliferation of text databases within large organizations and on the Internet makes it difficult for a person to know which databases to search. Given language models  that describe the contents of each database, a database selection  algorithm such as GlOSS can provide assistance by automatically selecting appropriate databases for an information need. Current practice is that each database provides its language model upon request, but this cooperative  approach has important limitations. This paper demonstrates that cooperation is not required. Instead, the database selection service can construct its own language models by sampling database contents via the normal process of running queries and retrieving documents. Although random sampling is not possible, it can be approximated with carefully selected queries. This sampling  approach avoids the limitations that characterize the cooperative approach, and also enables additional capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate th...

Using a Case Base of Surfaces to Speed-Up Reinforcement Learning . This paper demonstrates the exploitation of certain vision processing techniques to index into a case base of surfaces. The surfaces are the result of reinforcement learning and represent the optimum choice of actions to achieve some goal from anywhere in the state space. This paper shows how strong features that occur in the interaction of the system with its environment can be detected early in the learning process. Such features allow the system to identify when an identical, or very similar, task has been solved previously and to retrieve the relevant surface. This results in an orders of magnitude increase in learning rate. 1 Introduction  One important research issue for case based learning is its combination with other learning methods.

The categorization is based on a directed acyclic  graph and each document is assigned to one or more nodes, using  superimposed coding we represent the categorization information  of each document in a signature. In this paper we explain the  superimposed coding theory and how this coding technique can  be applied to more flexible environments. Furthermore, we realize an exhaustive analysis of the important factors that have  repercussions on the performance of the system. Finally we  expose the conclusions obtained from this article.

Keyword Searching and Browsing in Databases using BANKS With the growth of the Web, there has been a rapid increase in the number of users who need to access online databases without having a detailed knowledge of the schema or of query languages; even relatively simple query languages designed for non-experts are too complicated for them. We describe BANKS, a system which enables keyword-based search on relational databases, together with data and schema browsing. BANKS enables users to extract information in a simple manner without any knowledge of the schema or any need for writing complex queries. A user can get information by typing a few keywords, following hyperlinks, and interacting with controls on the displayed results. BANKS models tuples as nodes in a graph, connected by links induced by foreign key and other relationships. Answers to a query are modeled as rooted trees connecting tuples that match individual keywords in the query. Answers are ranked using a notion of proximity coupled with a notion of prestige of nodes based on inlinks, similar to techniques developed for Web search. We present an efficient heuristic algorithm for finding and ranking query results. 1.

Combining Labeled and Unlabeled Data for Text Classification With a Large Number of Categories A major concern with supervised learning techniques for text classification  is that they often require a large number of labeled examples to learn  accurately. One way to reduce the amount of labeled data required is to  develop algorithms that can learn effectively from a small number of labeled  examples augmented with a large number of unlabeled examples.  In this paper, we develop a framework to incorporate unlabeled data in  the Error-Correcting Output Coding (ECOC) setup by decomposing multiclass  problems into multiple binary problems and then use Co-Training  to learn the individual binary classification problems. We show that our  method is especially useful for classification tasks involving a large number  of categories where Co-training doesn't perform very well by itself  and when combined with ECOC, outperforms several other algorithms  that combine labeled and unlabeled data for text classification.  1

Mixed Depth Representations for Dialog Processing We describe our work on developing a general purpose tutoring system that will allow students to practice their decision-making skills in a number of domains. The tutoring system, B2, supports mixed-initiative natural language interaction. The natural language processing and knowledge representation components are also general purpose|which leads to a tradeo between the limitations of super cial processing and syntactic representations and the di culty of deeper methods and conceptual representations. Students ' utterances may be short and ambiguous, requiring extensive reasoning about the domain or the discourse model to fully resolve. However, full disambiguation is rarely necessary. Our solution is to use a mixed-depth representation, one that encodes syntactic and conceptual information in the same structure. As a result, we can use the same representation framework to produce a detailed representation of requests (which tend to be well-speci ed) and to produce a partial representation of questions (which tend to require more inference about the context). Moreover, the representations use the same knowledge representation framework that is used to reason about discourse processing and domain information|so that the system can reason with (and about) the utterances, if necessary.

Representation of behavioral history forl earningin nonstationary conditions A robot having to operate in nonstationary conditions needs to learn how to modify its control policy to adapt to the changing dynamics of the environment. Using the behavior-based approach to manage the interactions between the robot and its environment, we propose a method that models these interactions and adapts the selection of behaviors according to the history of behavior use. The learning and the use of this &quot;Interaction Model &quot; are validated using a vision- and sonar-based Pioneer I robot in the context of a multi-robot foraging task. Results show the effectiveness of the approach in taking advantage of any regularities experienced in the world, leading to fast and adaptable specialization for the learning robot. 1

A vital componentofanyWeb-based information agent is a set of wrappers that can extract the relevant data from semistructured information sources. Our novel approach to wrapper induction is based on the idea of hierarchical information extraction, which turns the hard problem of extracting data from an arbitrarily complex documentinto a series of simpler extraction tasks. We introduce an inductive algorithm, stalker, that generates high accuracy extraction rules based on user-labeled training examples. Labeling the training data represents the major bottleneck in using wrapper induction techniques, and our experimental results showthatstalker requires up to two orders of magnitude fewer examples than other algorithms. Furthermore,    can wrap information sources that could not be wrapped by existing inductivetechniques.

Vision-Guided Navigation Using SHOSLIF . This paper presents an unconventional approach to vision-guided autonomous navigation. The system recalls information about scenes and navigational experience using content-based retrieval from a visual database. To achieve a high applicability to various road types, we do not impose a priori scene features, such as road edges, that the system must use. But rather, the system automatically derives features from images during supervised learning. To accomplish this, the system uses principle component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to automatically derive the most expressive features (MEF) for scene reconstruction or the most discriminating features (MDF) for scene classi cation. These features best describe or classify the population of the scenes and approximate complex decision regions using piecewise linear boundaries up to a desired accuracy.

Learning and Tracking Human Motion Using Functional Analysis We present a method for the modeling and tracking of human motion using a sequence of 2D video images. Our analysis is divided in two parts: statistical learning and Bayesian tracking. First, we estimate a statistical model of typical activities from a large set of 3D human motion data. For this purpose, the human body is represented as a set of articulated cylinders and the evolution of a particular joint angle is described by a time-series. Specifically, we consider periodic motion such as ‚Äúwalking ‚Äù in this work, and we develop a new set of tools that allows for the automatic segmentation of the training data into a sequence of identical ‚Äúmotion cycles‚Äù. Then we compute the mean and the principal components of these cycles using a new algorithm to account for missing information and to enforce smooth transitions between different cycles. The learned temporal model provides a prior probability distribution over human motions which is used for tracking. We adopt a Bayesian perspective and approximate the posterior distribution of the body parameters using a particle filter. The resulting algorithm is able to track human subjects in monocular video sequences and to recover their 3D motion in complex unknown environments. 1

Engineering Mobile-agent Applications via Context-dependent Coordination The design and development of Internet applications can take advantage of a paradigm based on autonomous and mobile agents. However, mobility introduces peculiar coordination problems in agent-based Internet applications. First, it suggests the exploitation of an infrastructure based on a multiplicity of local interaction spaces. Second, it may require coordination activities to be adapted both to the characteristics of the execution environment where they occur and to the needs of the application to which the coordinating agents belong. In this context, this paper introduces the concept of context-dependent coordination based on programmable interaction spaces. On the one hand, interaction spaces associated to different execution environments may be independently programmed so as to lead to differentiated, environment-dependent, behaviors. On the other hand, agents can program the interaction spaces of the visited execution environments to obtain an application-dependent behavior of the interaction spaces themselves. Several examples show how an infrastructure enforcing context-dependent coordination can be effectively exploited to simplify and make more modular the design of Internet applications based on mobile agents. In addition, the MARS coordination infrastructure is presented as an example of a system in which the concept of context-dependent coordination has found a clean and efficient implementation.

Continuous Categories For a Mobile Robot Autonomous agents make frequent use of knowledge in the form of categories --- categories of objects, human gestures, web pages, and so on.

We address several issues related to the use of an uninterpreted sensory apparatus and show specific examples where a Pioneer 1 mobile robot interacts with objects in a cluttered laboratory setting.  Introduction  "There is nothing more basic than categorization to our thought, perception, action, and speech" (Lakoff 1987).

In particular, it addresses the following questions: Why can support vector machines handle the large feature spaces in text classification effectively? How is this related to the statistical properties of text? What are sufficient conditions for applying SVMs to text-classification problems successfully?

Generalised Object-Oriented Concepts for Inter-Agent Communication . In this paper, we describe a framework to program open societies of concurrently operating agents. The agents maintain a subjective theory about their environment and interact with each other via a communication mechanism suited for the exchange of information, which is a generalisation of the traditional rendez-vous communication mechanism from the object-oriented programming paradigm. Moreover, following object-oriented programming, agents are grouped into agent classes according to their particular characteristics; viz. the program that governs their behaviour, the language they employ to represent information and most interestingly the questions they can be asked to answer. We give and operational model of the programming language in terms of a transition system for the formal derivation of computations of multi-agent programs. 1 Introduction The field of multi-agent systems is a rapidly growing research area.

The Intelligent Surfer: Probabilistic Combination of Link and Content Information in PageRank The PageRank algorithm, used in the Google search engine, greatly  improves the results of Web search by taking into account the link  structure of the Web. PageRank assigns to a page a score proportional  to the number of times a random surfer would visit that page,  if it surfed indefinitely from page to page, following all outlinks  from a page with equal probability. We propose to improve PageRank  by using a more intelligent surfer, one that is guided by a  probabilistic model of the relevance of a page to a query. Efficient  execution of our algorithm at query time is made possible by precomputing  at crawl time (and thus once for all queries) the necessary  terms. Experiments on two large subsets of the Web indicate  that our algorithm significantly outperforms PageRank in the (human  -rated) quality of the pages returned, while remaining efficient  enough to be used in today's large search engines.

SCANMail: a voicemail interface that makes speech browsable, readable and searchable Increasing amounts of public, corporate, and private speech data are now available on-line. These are limited in their usefulness, however, by the lack of tools to permit their browsing and search. The goal of our research is to provide tools to overcome the inherent difficulties of speech access, by supporting visual scanning, search, and information extraction. We describe a novel principle for the design of UIs to speech data: What You See Is Almost What You Hear (WYSIAWYH). In WYSIAWYH, automatic speech recognition (ASR) generates a transcript of the speech data. The transcript is then used as a visual analogue to that underlying data. A graphical user interface allows users to visually scan, read, annotate and search these transcripts. Users can also use the transcript to access and play specific regions of the underlying message. We first summarize previous studies of voicemail usage that motivated the WYSIAWYH principle, and describe a voicemail UI, SCANMail, that embodies WYSIAWYH. We report on a laboratory experiment and an 18 user, two month field trial evaluation. SCANMail outperformed a state of the art voicemail system on core voicemail tasks. This was attributable to SCANMail's support for visual scanning, search and information extraction. While the ASR transcripts contain errors, they nevertheless improve the efficiency of voicemail processing. Transcripts either provide enough information for users to extract key points or to navigate to important regions of the underlying speech, which they can then play directly.

Team Formation by Self-Interested Mobile Agents . A process of team formation by autonomous agents in a distributed  environment is presented. Since the environment is distributed,  there are serious problems with communication and consistent decision  making inside a team. To deal with these problems, the standard technique  of token passing in a computer network is applied. The passing  cycle of the token serves as the communication route. It assures consistent  decision making inside the team maintaining its organizational  integrity. On the other hand it constitutes a component of the plan of  the cooperative work performed by a complete team. Two algorithms for  team formation are given. The first one is based on simple self-interested  agents that still can be viewed as reactive agents (see [14]) although augmented  with knowledge, goal, and cooperation mechanisms. The second  one is based on sophisticated self-interested agents. Moreover, the algorithm  based on fully cooperative agents, which is an adaptation of the  static ...

A Clausal Resolution Method for CTL Branching-Time Temporal Logic In this paper we extend our clausal resolution method for linear time temporal logics to a branching-time framework. Thus, we propose an efficient deductive method useful in a variety of applications requiring an expressive branching-time temporal logic in AI. The branching-time temporal logic considered is Computation Tree Logic (CTL), often regarded as the simplest useful logic of this class. The key elements of the resolution method, namely the normal form, the concept of step resolution and a novel temporal resolution rule, are introduced and justified with respect to this logic. A completeness argument is provided, together with some examples of the use of the temporal resolution method. Finally, we consider future work, in particular the extension of the method yet further, to Extended CTL (ECTL), which is CTL extended with fairness operators, and CTL    , the most powerful logic of this class. We will also outline possible implementation of the approach by adapting techniques de...

Exploiting Synergy Between Ontologies and Recommender Systems Recommender systems learn about user preferences over time, automatically finding things of similar interest. This reduces the burden of creating explicit queries. Recommender systems do, however, suffer from cold-start problems where no initial information is available early on upon which to base recommendations. Semantic knowledge structures, such as ontologies, can provide valuable domain knowledge and user information. However, acquiring such knowledge and keeping it up to date is not a trivial task and user interests are particularly difficult to acquire and maintain. This paper investigates the synergy between a web-based research paper recommender system and an ontology containing information automatically extracted from departmental databases available on the web. The ontology is used to address the recommender systems cold-start problem. The recommender system addresses the ontology‚Äôs interest-acquisition problem. An empirical evaluation of this approach is conducted and the performance of the integrated systems measured.

Data Mining At The Interface Of Computer Science And Statistics This chapter is written for computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and scientists who wish to gain a better understanding of the role of statistical thinking in modern data mining. Data mining has attracted considerable attention both in the research and commercial arenas in recent years, involving the application of a variety of techniques from both computer science and statistics. The chapter discusses how computer scientists and statisticians approach data from different but complementary viewpoints and highlights the fundamental differences between statistical and computational views of data mining. In doing so we review the historical importance of statistical contributions to machine learning and data mining, including neural networks, graphical models, and flexible predictive modeling. The primary conclusion is that closer integration of computational methods with statistical thinking is likely to become increasingly important in data mining applications.

On the Robustness of some Cryptographic Protocols for Mobile Agent Protection Mobile agent security is still a young discipline and most naturally,  the focus up to the time of writing was on inventing new cryptographic protocols  for securing various aspects of mobile agents. However, past experience shows  that protocols can be flawed, and flaws in protocols can remain unnoticed for a  long period of time. The game of breaking and fixing protocols is a necessary  evolutionary process that leads to a better understanding of the underlying problems  and ultimately to more robust and secure systems. Although, to the best of  our knowledge, little work has been published on breaking protocols for mobile  agents, it is inconceivable that the multitude of protocols proposed so far are all  flawless. As it turns out, the opposite is true. We identify flaws in protocols proposed  by Corradi et al., Karjoth et al., and Karnik et al., including protocols based  on secure co-processors.

Indexing the Distance: An Efficient Method to KNN Processing In this paper, we present an efficient method, called iDistance, for K-nearest neighbor (KNN) search in a high-dimensional space. iDistance partitions the data and selects a reference point for each partition. The data in each cluster are transformed into a single dimensional space based on their similarity with respect to a reference point. This allows the points to be indexed using a B + -tree structure and KNN search be performed using one-dimensional range search. The choice of partition and reference point provides the iDistance technique with degrees of freedom most other techniques do not have. We describe how appropriate choices here can effectively adapt the index structure to the data distribution. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the iDistance technique, and report results demonstrating its effectiveness.

To Boldly Go: Bayesian Exploration for Mobile Robots This work addresses the problem of robot exploration. That is, the task of automatically learning a map of the environment which is useful for mobile robot navigation and localization. The exploration mechanism is intended to be applicable to an arbitrary environment, and is independent of the particular representation of the world. We take an information-theoretic approach and avoid the use of arbitrary heuristics. Preliminary results are presented and we discuss future directions for investigation.

Equal Time for Data on the Internet with WebSemantics . Many collections of scientific data in particular disciplines are available today around the world. Much of this data conforms to some agreed upon standard for data exchange, i.e., a standard schema and its semantics. However, sharing this data among a global community of users is still difficult because of a lack of standards for the following necessary functions: (i) data providers need a standard for describing or publishing available sources of data; (ii) data administrators need a standard for discovering the published data and (iii) users need a standard for accessing this discovered data. This paper describes a prototype implementation of a system, WebSemantics, that accomplishes the above tasks. We describe an architecture and protocols for the publication, discovery and access to scientific data. We define a language for discovering sources and querying the data in these sources, and we provide a formal semantics for this language. 1 Introduction  Recently, many standardized...

A Practical Approach for Recovery of Evicted Variables SRC‚Äôs charter is to advance the state of the art in computer systems by doing basic and applied research in support of our company‚Äôs business objectives. Our interests and projects span scalable systems (including hardware, networking, distributed systems, and programming-language technology), the Internet (including the Web, e-commerce, and information retrieval), and human/computer interaction (including user-interface technology, computer-based appliances, and mobile computing). SRC was established in 1984 by Digital Equipment Corporation. We test the value of our ideas by building hardware and software prototypes and assessing their utility in realistic settings. Interesting systems are too complex to be evaluated solely in the abstract; practical use enables us to investigate their properties in depth. This experience is useful in the short term in refining our designs and invaluable in the long term in advancing our knowledge. Most of the major advances in information systems have come through this approach, including personal computing, distributed systems, and the Internet.

Intelligent Diagnosis Systems This paper examines and compares several different approaches to the design of Intelligent Systems for Diagnosis and Advising applications. These include expert systems or knowledge-based systems, case-based reasoning systems, truth (or reason) maintenance systems, statistical pattern classification systems, decision trees, and artificial neural networks (or connectionist systems). The key aspects of each approach are demonstrated through the design of a system for a simple automobile fault diagnosis task.

Conversation Trees and Threaded Chats Chat programs and instant messaging services are increasingly popular among Internet users. However, basic issues with the interfaces and data structures of most forms of chat limit their utility for use in formal interactions (like group meetings) and decision-making tasks. In this paper, we discuss Threaded Text Chat, a program designed to address some of the deficiencies of current chat programs. Standard forms of chat introduce ambiguity into interaction in a number of ways, most profoundly by rupturing connections between turns and replies. Threaded Chat presents a solution to this problem by actively supporting the basic turn-taking structure of human conversation. While the solution introduces interface design challenges of its own, usability studies show that users' patterns of interaction in Threaded Chat are equally effective, but different (and possibly more efficient) than standard chat programs.

Target Seeking Crawlers and their Topical Performance Topic driven crawlers can complement search engines by targeting relevant portions of the Web. A topic driven crawler must exploit the information available about the topic and its underlying context. In this paper we extend our previous research on the design and evaluation of topic driven crawlers by comparing seven different crawlers on a harder problem, namely, seeking highly relevant target pages. We find that exploration is an important aspect of a crawling strategy. We also study how the performance of crawler strategies depends on a number of topical characteristics based on notions of topic generality, cohesiveness, and authoritativeness. Our results reveal that topic generality is an obstacle for most crawlers, that three crawlers tend to perform better when the target pages are clustered together, and that two of these also display better performance when topic targets are highly authoritative.

Nexus - An Open Global Infrastructure for Spatial-Aware Applications Due to the lack of a generic platform for location- and spatial-aware systems, many basic services have to be reimplemented in each application that uses spatial-awareness. A cooperation among different applications is also difficult to achieve without a common platform. In this paper we present a platform that solves these problems. It provides an infrastructure that is based on computer models of regions of the physical world, which are augmented by virtual objects. We show how virtual objects make the integration of existing information systems and services in spatial-aware systems easier. Furthermore, our platform supports interactions between the computer models and the real world and integrates single models in a global "Augmented World".

Compositional Design and Reuse of a Generic Agent Model This paper introduces a formally specified design of a compositional generic agent model (GAM). This  agent model abstracts from specific application domains; it provides a unified formal definition of a model  for weak agenthood. It can be (re)used as a template or pattern for a large variety of agent types and  application domain types. The model was designed on the basis of experiences in a number of application  domains. The compositional development method DESIRE was used to design the agent model GAM at a  conceptual and logical level. It serves as a unified, precisely defined coneptual structure which can be  refined by specialisation and instantiation to a large variety of other, more specific agents. To illustrate  reuse of this agent model, specialisation and instantiation to model co-operative information gathering  agents is described in depth. Moreover, it is shown how GAM can be used to describe in a unified and  hence more comparable manner a large number of agent architectures from the literature.

The robots total repertoire of skills is high according to the complexity of the building and its respective task. Difficult tasks can only be achieved on the base by immediate sensing of the environment. This paper describes a five layer sensor architecture with an integrated world model for multistory buildings. In contrast to grid based approaches we use a feature based approach. The sensor architecture as well as the evaluation modules of the sensor data are based on natural landmarks. The key features of the sensor architecture are reuseability, modularity and portability to other multistory buildings as well as extendibility with different sensors.

Integrating Models of Personality and Emotions into Lifelike Characters . A growing number of research projects in academia and industry  have recently started to develop lifelike agents as a new metaphor for highly  personalised human-machine communication.

JRes: A Resource Accounting Interface for Java With the spread of the Internet the computing model on server systems is undergoing several important changes. Recent research ideas concerning dynamic operating system extensibility are finding their way into the commercial domain, resulting in designs of extensible databases and Web servers. In addition, both ordinary users and service providers must deal with untrusted downloadable executable code of unknown origin and intentions.  Across the board, Java has emerged as the language of choice for Internet-oriented software. We argue that, in order to realize its full potential in applications dealing with untrusted code, Java needs a flexible resource accounting interface.

The interface allows to account for heap memory, CPU time, and network resources consumed by individual threads or groups of threads.

System Lag Tests for Augmented and Virtual Environments We describe a simple technique for accurately calibrating the temporal lag in augmented and virtual environments within the Enhanced Virtual Hand Lab (EVHL), a  collection of hardware and software to support research on goal-directed human hand motion. Lag is the sum of various delays in the data pipeline associated with sensing, processing, and displaying information from the physical world to produce an augmented or virtual world. Our main calibration technique uses a modified phonograph turntable to provide easily tracked periodic motion, reminiscent of the pendulum-based calibration technique of Liang, Shaw and Green. Measurements show a three-frame (50 ms) lag for the EVHL. A second technique, which uses a  specialized analog sensor that is part of the EVHL, provides a "closed loop" calibration capable of sub-frame accuracy. Knowing the lag to sub-frame accuracy enables a predictive tracking scheme to compensate for the end-toend  lag in the data pipeline. We describe both techniques and the EVHL environment in which they are used.

MAPWEB: Cooperation between Planning Agents and Web Agents This paper presents MAPWeb (MultiAgent Planning in the Web), a multiagent system for cooperative work among dierent intelligent software agents whose main goal is to solve user planning problems using the information stored in the World Wide Web (Web). MAPWeb is made of a heterogeneous mixture of intelligent agents whose main characteristics are cooperation, reasoning, and knowledge sharing. The architecture of MAPWeb uses four types of agents:UserAgents that are the bridge between the users and the system; ControlAgents (Manager and Coach Agents) that are responsible to manage the rest of agents; PlannerAgents  that are able to solve planning problems; and nally WebAgents whose aim is to retrieve, represent and share information obtained from the Web. MAPWeb solves planning problems by means of cooperation between PlannerAgents and WebAgents. Instead of trying the PlannerAgent to solve the whole planning problem, the PlannerAgent focuses on a less restricted (and therefore easier to solve) problem (what we call an abstract problem) and cooperates with the WebAgents to validate and complete abstract solutions. In order for cooperation to take place, a common language and data structures have also been dened.

Audio-Visual Speaker Detection using Dynamic Bayesian Networks The development of human-computer interfaces poses a challenging problem: actions and intentions of different users have to be inferred from sequences of noisy and ambiguous sensory data. Temporal fusion of multiple sensors can be efficiently formulated using dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). DBN framework allows the power of statistical inference and learning to be combined with contextual knowledge of the problem. We demonstrate the use of DBNs in tackling the problem of audio/visual speaker detection. "Off-the-shelf" visual and audio sensors (face, skin, texture, mouth motion, and silence detectors) are optimally fused along with contextual information in a DBN architecture that infers instances when an individual is speaking. Results obtained in the setup of an actual human-machine interaction system (Genie Casino Kiosk) demonstrate superiority of our approach over that of static, context-free fusion architecture.  1.

Learning to Match and Cluster Entity Names Introduction Information retrieval is, in large part, the study of methods for assessing the similarity of pairs of documents. Document similarity metrics have been used for many tasks including ad hoc document retrieval, text classification [YC1994], and summarization [GC1998,SSMB1997]. Another problem area in which similarity metrics are central is record linkage (e.g., [KA1985]), where one wishes to determine if two database records taken from different source databases refer to the same entity. For instance, one might wish to determine if two database records from two different hospitals, each containing a patient's name, address, and insurance information, refer to the same person; as another example, one might wish to determine if two bibliography records, each containing a paper title, list of authors, and journal name, refer to the same publication.

An approach to using degrees of belief in BDI agents : The past few years have seen a rise in the popularity of the use of mentalistic attitudes such as beliefs, desires and intentions to describe intelligent agents. Many of the models which formalise such attitudes do not admit degrees of belief, desire and intention. We see this as an understandable simplification, but as a simplification which means that the resulting systems cannot take account of much of the useful information which helps to guide human reasoning about the world. This paper starts to develop a more sophisticated system based upon an existing formal model of these mental attributes.  1 Introduction  In the past few years there has been a lot of attention given to building formal models of autonomous software agents; pieces of software which operate to some extent independently of human intervention and which therefore may be considered to have their own goals and the ability to determine how to achieve those goals.

Model Checking Agent UML Protocol Diagrams Agents in multiagent systems use protocols in order to exchange messages and to coordinate together. Since agents and objects are not exactly the same, designers do not use directly communication protocols used in distributed systems but a new type called interaction protocols encompassing agent features such as richer messages and the ability to cooperate and to coordinate. Obviously, designers consider formal description techniques used for communication protocols. New graphical modeling languages based on UML appeared several years ago. Agent UML is certainly the best known. Until now, no validation is given for Agent UML. The aim of this paper is to present how to model check Agent UML protocol diagrams.

A Fast Multi-Dimensional Algorithm for Drawing Large Graphs We present a novel hierarchical force-directed method for drawing large graphs. The algorithm produces a graph embedding in an Euclidean space E of any dimension. A two or three dimensional drawing of the graph is then obtained by projecting a higher-dimensional embedding into a two or three dimensional subspace of E. Projecting high-dimensional drawings onto two or three dimensions often results in drawings that are "smoother" and more symmetric. Among the other notable features of our approach are the utilization of a maximal independent set filtration of the set of vertices of a graph, a fast energy function minimization strategy, e#cient memory management, and an intelligent initial placement of vertices. Our implementation of the algorithm can draw graphs with tens of thousands of vertices using a negligible amount of memory in less than one minute on a mid-range PC. 1 Introduction  Graphs are common in many applications, from data structures to networks, from software engineering...

Some Considerations about Embodied Agents   As computers are being more and more part of our world we feel the urgent need of proper user interface to interact with. The use of command lines typed on a keyboard are more and more obsolete, specially as computers are receiving so much attention from a large audience. The metaphor of face-to-face communication applied to human-computer interaction is finding a lot of attraction. Humans are used since they are born to communicate with others. Seeing faces, interpreting their expressions, understanding speech are all part of our development and growth. But face-to-face conversation is very complex as it involved a huge number of factors. We speak with our voice, but also with our hand, eye, face and body. Our gesture modifies, emphasizes, contradicts what we say by words.

Wouldn't it be more efficient to have a reminder to buy groceries and the shopping list delivered to you when you were in the vicinity of the store?  We live in a world in which the information overload is part of our daily life. Many of us receive large quantities of email or voice mail messages. Yet many of these messages are relevant only in a particular context. We can use a system of reminders to keep up with all we have to do, but these reminders are often relevant only to a specific location. If reminders, to-do lists, messages and other information were delivered in the most timely and relevant context, part of the overload would be reduced.

Rewriting Logic as a Metalogical Framework A metalogical framework is a logic with an associated methodology that is used to represent other logics and to reason about their metalogical properties. We propose that logical frameworks can be good metalogical frameworks when their logics support reflective reasoning and their theories always have initial models. We present a concrete realization of this idea in rewriting logic. Theories in rewriting logic always have initial models and this logic supports reflective reasoning. This implies that inductive reasoning is valid when proving properties about the initial models of theories in rewriting logic, and that we can use reflection to reason at the metalevel about these properties. In fact, we can uniformly reflect induction principles for proving metatheorems about rewriting logic theories and their parameterized extensions. We show that this reflective methodology provides an effective framework for di erent, non-trivial, kinds of formal metatheoretic reasoning; one can, for examp...

Controlling the Robots of Web Search Engines Robots are deployed by a Web search engine for collecting information from different Web servers in order to maintain the currency of its data base of Web pages. In this paper, we investigate the number of robots to be used by a search engine so as to maximize the currency of the data base without putting an unnecessary load on the network. We use a queueing model to represent the system. The arrivals to the queueing system are Web pages brought by the robots; service corresponds to the indexing of these pages. The objective is to find the number of robots, and thus the arrival rate of the queueing system, such that the indexing queue is neither starved nor saturated. For this, we consider a finite-buffer queueing system and define the cost function to be minimized as a weighted sum of the loss rate and the fraction of time that the system is empty. Both static and dynamic policies are considered. In the static setting the number of robots is held fixed; in the dynamic setting robots may be re...

Reverse Nearest Neighbor Queries for Dynamic Databases In this paper we propose an algorithm for answering reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) queries, a problem formulated only recently. This class of queries is strongly related to that of nearest neighbor (NN) queries, although the two are not necessarily complementary. Unlike nearest neighbor queries, RNN queries find the set of database points that have the query point as the nearest neighbor. There is no other proposal we are aware of, that provides an algorithmic approach to answer RNN queries. The earlier approach for RNN queries ([KM99]) is based on the pre-computation of neighborhood information that is organized in terms of auxiliary data structures. It can be argued that the precomputation of the RNN information for all points in the database can be too restrictive. In the case of dynamic databases, insert and update operations are expensive and can lead to modifications of large parts of the auxiliary data structures. Also, answers to RNN queries for a set of data points depend on t...

We are interested in using these technologies to achieve a true integration of printed and digital information sources such that users may browse freely back and forth between paper and digital resources. We present web-based server technologies that support this integration by allowing users to dynamically link areas of printed documents to objects of an application database.

How Emotions and Personality Effect the Utility of Alternative Decisions: A Terrorist Target Selection Case Study The role of emotion modeling in the development of computerized agents has long been unclear. This is  partially due to instability in the philosophical issues of the problem as psychologists struggle to build models for their  own purposes, and partially due to the often-wide gap between these theories and that which can be implemented by an  agent author. This paper describes an effort to use emotion models in part as a deep model of utility for use in decision  theoretic agents. This allows for the creation of simulated forces capable of balancing a great deal of competing goals,  and in doing so they behave, for better or for worse, in a more realistic manner.

Learning Comprehensible Conceptual User Models for User Adaptive Meta Web Search In course of the OySTER project our goal is to induce conceptual user models that allow for a transparent query refinement and information filtering in the domain of Www meta--search. User models which describe a user's interest with respect to an underlying ontology allow for a manual user model editing process and also pose a well defined problem for a conceptual inductive learning task. OySTER is a research prototype that is currently being developed at the university of Osnabruck. Introduction User Modeling and Machine Learning. User models represent assumptions about a user. User modeling systems infer user models from user interaction, store user models and induce new assumptions by reasoning about the models. These models are used within the system in order to adapt to the user. Furthermore, these models shall be accessible to the user --- they should be both understandable and manually modifyable.

LIME: Linda Meets Mobility Lime is a system designed to assist in the rapid development of dependable mobile applications over both wired and ad hoc networks. Mobile agents reside on mobile hosts and all communication takes place via transiently shared tuple spaces distributed across the mobile hosts. The decoupled style of computing characterizing the Linda model is extended to the mobile environment. At the application level, both agents and hosts perceive movement as a sudden change of context. The set of tuples accessible by a particular agent residing on a given host is altered transparently in response to changes in the connectivity pattern among the mobile hosts. In this paper we present the key design concepts behind the Lime system. 1 INTRODUCTION Today's users demand ubiquitous network access independent of their physical location. This style of computation, often referred to as mobile computing, is enabled by rapid advances in the wireless communication technology. The networking scenarios enabled ...

A Layered Approach towards Domain Authoring Support This paper presents an approach to authoring support for Web courseware based on a layered  ontological paradigm. The ontology-based layers in the courseware authoring architecture  serve as a basis for formal semantics and reasoning support in performing generic authoring  tasks. This approach represents an extension of our knowledge classification and indexing  mechanism from a previously developed system, AIMS, aimed at supporting students while  completing learning tasks in a Web-based learning/training environment. We propose the addition  of two vertical layers in the system architecture, Author assisting layer and Operational  layer, with the role of facilitating the creation of the ontological layers (Course ontology and  Domain ontology) and of the educational metadata layer. Here we focus on the domain ontology  creation process, together with the support that the additional layers can provide within  this process. We exemplify our method by presenting a set of generic tasks related to conceptbased  domain authoring and their ontological support

Scaling Question Answering to the Web The wealth of information on the web makes it an attractive resource for seeking quick answers to simple, factual questions such as ‚Äúwho was the first American in space? ‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat is the second tallest mountain in the world? ‚Äù Yet today‚Äôs most advanced web search services (e.g., Google and AskJeeves) make it surprisingly tedious to locate answers to such questions. In this paper, we extend question-answering techniques, first studied in the information retrieval literature, to the web and experimentally evaluate their performance. First we introduce MULDER, which we believe to be the first general-purpose, fully-automated question-answering system available on the web. Second, we describe MULDER‚Äôs architecture, which relies on multiple search-engine queries, natural-language parsing, and a novel voting procedure to yield reliable answers coupled with high recall. Finally, we compare MULDER‚Äôs performance to that of Google and AskJeeves on questions drawn from the TREC-8 question answering track. We find that MULDER‚Äôs recall is more than a factor of three higher than that of AskJeeves. In addition, we find that Google requires 6.6 times as much user effort to achieve the same level of recall as MULDER.

Heterogeneous Multimedia Database Selection on the Web Multimedia databases on the Web have two distinct characteristics, autonomy and heterogeneity. They are established and maintained independently and queries are processed depending on their own schemes. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the database selection from a number of multimedia databases dispersed on the Web. In the multimedia objects retrieval from distributed sites, it is crucial that the metaserver has the capability to find objects, globally similar to a given query object, from different multimedia databases with different local similarity measures. We propose a novel selection algorithm to determine candidate databases that contain more objects relevant to the query than other databases. The selection of databases is based on the number of relevant objects at each local database that is estimated by using a few sample objects and the histogram information. An extensive experiment on a large number of real data sets demonstrates that our proposed method perform...

Data-Driven Generation of Compact, Accurate, and Linguistically-Sound Fuzzy Classifiers Based on a Decision-Tree Initialization The data-driven identification of fuzzy rule-based classifiers for high-dimensional problems is addressed. A binary decision-tree-based initialization of fuzzy classifiers is proposed for the selection of the relevant features and e#ective initial partitioning of the input domains of the fuzzy system. Fuzzy classifiers have more flexible decision boundaries than decision trees (DTs) and can therefore be more parsimonious. Hence, the decision tree initialized fuzzy classifier is reduced in an iterative scheme by means of similarity-driven rule-reduction. To improve classification performance of the reduced fuzzy system, a genetic algorithm with a multi-objective criterion searching for both redundancy and accuracy is applied. The proposed approach is studied for (i) an artificial problem, (ii) the Wisconsin Breast Cancer classification Preprint submitted to Elsevier Science 19 May 2002 problem, and (iii) a summary of results is given for a set of well-known classification problems available from the Internet: Iris, Ionospehere, Glass, Pima, and Wine data.

A Layered Approach To Nlp-Based Information Retrieval A layered approach to information retrieval permits the inclusion of multiple search engines as well as multiple databases, with a natural language layer to convert English queries for use by the various search engines. The NLP layer incorporates morphological analysis, noun phrase syntax, and semantic expansion based on WordNet.  1 Introduction  This paper describes a layered approach to information retrieval, and the natural language component that is a major element in that approach. The layered approach, packaged as Intermezzo  TM  , was deployed in a pre-product form at a government site. The NLP component has been installed, with a proprietary IR engine, PhotoFile, (Flank, Martin, Balogh and Rothey, 1995), (Flank, Garfield, and Norkin, 1995), at several commercial sites, including Picture Network International (PNI), Simon and Schuster, and John Deere.

Finding the Most Similar Documents across Multiple Text Databases In this paper, we present a methodology for finding the n most similar documents across multiple text databases for any given query and for any positive integer n. This methodology consists of two steps. First, databases are ranked in a certain order. Next, documents are retrieved from the databases according to the order and in a particular way. If the databases containing the n most similar documents for a given query can be ranked ahead of other databases, the methodology will guarantee the retrieval of the n most similar documents for the query. A statistical method is provided to identify databases, each of which is estimated to contain at least one of the n most similar documents. Then, a number of strategies is presented to retrieve documents from the identified databases. Experimental results are given to illustrate the relative performance of different strategies. 1 Introduction The Internet has become a vast information source in recent years and can be considered as the w...

Learning to Perceive the World as Articulated: An Approach for Hierarchical Learning in Sensory-Motor Systems This paper describes how agents can learn an internal model of the world  structurally by focusing on the problem of behavior-based articulation. We develop  an on-line learning scheme -- the so-called mixture of recurrent neural  net (RNN) experts -- in which a set of RNN modules becomes self-organized  as experts on multiple levels in order to account for the different categories  of sensory-motor flow which the robot experiences. Autonomous switching of  activated modules in the lower level actually represents the articulation of the  sensory-motor flow. In the meanwhile, a set of RNNs in the higher level competes  to learn the sequences of module switching in the lower level, by which articulation  at a further more abstract level can be achieved. The proposed scheme  was examined through simulation experiments involving the navigation learning  problem. Our dynamical systems analysis clarified the mechanism of the articulation;  the possible correspondence between the articulation...

During the last two years, we have been working on a project that tries to overcome some of the limitations found in terms of programmability and usability of the mobile agent paradigm in real applications. In the M&M framework there are no agent platforms. Instead applications become agent-enabled by using simple JavaBeans components. In our approach the agents arrive and departure directly from the applications, interacting with them from the inside.

Flexible Queries to Semi-structured Datasources: the WG-log Approach A line of research is presented aimed at specifying both logical and navigational aspects of semi-structured data sources such as Web sites through the unifying notion of schema. Gracefully supporting schemata that are huge or subject to change, the WG-Log language allows for a uniform representation of queries and views, the latter expressing customized access structures to site information. A survey of related work and some directions for future research involving fuzzy query techniques are also outlined. 1 Introduction and Motivations Modern network-oriented information systems often have to deal with data that are semi-structured, i.e. lack the strict, regular, and complete structure required by traditional database management systems (see [Abi97] and [Suc97] for a survey on semi-structured data and related research). Information is semi-structured also when the structure of data varies w.r.t. time, rather than w.r.t. space: even if data is fairly well structured, such struc...

Learning Task Models for Collagen For an application-independent collaborative tool, a  key step is to develop a detailed task model for a particular  domain. This is a time consuming and dicult  task, and seems to require a fairly advanced knowledge  of AI representations for plans, goals, and recipes.  This paper discusses some preliminary ideas for making  it easier to construct and evolve task models, either  through interaction with a human domain expert,  through machine learning, or in a mixed-initiative system.  Introduction  An important trend in recent work on human-computer interaction and user modeling has been to view humancomputer interaction as a kind of collaboration.

A Dynamic Replica Selection Algorithm for Tolerating Timing Faults Server replication is commonly used to improve the fault tolerance and response time of distributed services. An important problem when executing time-critical applications in a replicated environment is that of preventing timing failures by dynamically selecting the replicas that can satisfy a client's timing requirement, even when the quality of service is degraded due to replica failures and excess load on the server. In this paper, we describe the approach we have used to solve this problem in AQuA, a CORBA-based middleware that transparently replicates objects across a local area network. The approach we use estimates a replica's response time distribution based on performance measurements regularly broadcast by the replica. An online model uses these measurements to predict the probability with which a replica can prevent a timing failure for a client. A selection algorithm then uses this prediction to choose a subset of replicas that can together meet the client's timing constraints with at least the probability requested by the client. We conclude with experimental results based on our implementation.

Using Knowledge Containers to Model a Framework for Learning Adaptation Knowledge In this paper we present a framework for learning adaptation knowledge which knowledge light approaches for case-based reasoning (CBR) systems. Knowledge light means that these approaches use already acquired knowledge inside the CBR system. Therefor we describe the sources of knowledge inside a CBR system along the different knowledge containers. After that we present our framework in terms of these knowledge containers. Further we apply our framework in a case study to one knowledge light approach for learning adaptation knowledge. After that we point on some issues which should be addressed during the design or the use of such algorithms for learning adaptation knowledge. From our point of view many of these issues should be the topic of further research. Finally we close with a short discussion and an outlook to further work.

Real-Time Index Concurrency Control Real-time database systems are expected to rely heavily on indexes to speed up data access and thereby help more transactions meet their deadlines. Accordingly, highperformance index concurrency control (ICC) protocols are required to prevent contention for the index from becoming a bottleneck. In this paper, we develop real-time variants of a representative set of classical B-tree ICC protocols and, using a detailed simulation model, compare their performance for real-time transactions with firm deadlines. We also present and evaluate a new real-time ICC protocol called GUARD-link that augments the classical B-link protocol with a feedback-based admission control mechanism. Both point and range queries, as well as the undos of the index actions of aborted transactions are included in the scope of our study. The performance metrics used in evaluating the ICC protocols are the percentage of transactions that miss their deadlines and the fairness with respect to transaction type and size...

Flow Analysis for Verifying Specifications of Concurrent and Distributed Software This paper presents FLAVERS, a finite state verification approach that analyzes whether concurrent or sequential programs satisfy user-defined correctness properties. In contrast to other finite-state verification techniques, FLAVERS is based on algorithms with low-order polynomial bounds on the running time. FLAVERS achieves this efficiency at the cost of precision. Users, however, can improve the precision of the results by selectively and judiciously incorporating additional semantic information into the analysis problem. The FLAVERS analysis approach has been implemented for programs written in Ada. We report on an empirical study of the performance of applying the FLAVERS/Ada tool set to a collection of multi-tasking Ada programs. This study indicates that sufficient precision for proving program properties can be achieved and that the cost for such analysis grows as a low-order polynomial in the size of the program. 1 Introduction  The application of distributed and concurrent pr...

Evaluating Humanoid Synthetic Agents in E-Retail Applications This paper presents three experiments designed to empirically evaluate humanoid synthetic agents in electronic retail applications. Firstly, human-like agents were evaluated in a single e-retail application, a home furnishings service. The second experiment explored application dependency effects by evaluating the same human-like agents in a different e-retail application, a personalized CD service. The third experiment evaluated the effectiveness of a range of humanoid cartoon-like agents. Participants eavesdropped on spoken dialogues between a "customer" and each of the agents, which played the role of conversational sales assistants. Results showed participants expected a high level of realistic human-like verbal and nonverbal communicative behavior from the human-like agents. Overall ratings of the agents showed no significant application dependency: Two different groups of participants rated the human-like agents in similar ways in a different application. Further results showed participants have a preference for three--dimensional (3-D) rather than two--dimensional (2-D) cartoon-like agents and have a desire to interact with fully embodied agents.

Based on an incoming audio stream, a face image is animated with full lip synchronization and expression. An animation sequence using optical flow between visemes is constructed, given an incoming audio stream and still pictures of a face speaking different visemes. Rules are formulated based on coarticulation and the duration of a viseme to control the continuity in terms of shape and extent of lip opening. In addition to this new viseme-expression combinations are synthesized to be able to generate animations with new facial expressions. Finally various applications of this system are discussed in the context of creating audio-visual reality.  1.

Augmented Reality: Which Augmentation for Which Reality? In this paper, we first present a brief review of approaches used for studying and designing Augmented Reality (AR) systems. The variety of approaches and definitions in AR requires classification. We define two intrinsic characteristics of AR systems, task focus and nature of augmentation. Based on these two characteristics, we identify four classes of AR systems. In addition our OP-a-S notation provides a complementary characterization method based on interaction. Using OP-a-S, an AR system is modeled as a set of components that communicate with each other. One crucial type of OP-a-S component is the Adapter that establishes a bridge between the real world and the virtual world. By defining a classification scheme, we aim at providing a better understanding of the paradigm of AR and at laying the foundations of future design principles according to the class of systems.

Meeting Plan Recognition Requirements for Real-Time Air-Mission Simulations In this paper, the potential synergy between instancebased pattern recognition and means-end (possible world) reasoning is explored, for supporting plan recognition in multi-aeroplane air-mission simulations. A combination of graph matching, induction, probabilistic principles and dynamic programming are applied to traces of aeroplane behaviour during flight manoeuvres. These satisfy the real-time constraints of the simulation. This enables the agents to recognise what other agents are doing and to abstract about their activity, at the instrumentation level. A means-end-reasoning model is then used to deliberate about and invoke standard operating procedures, based on recognised activity. The reasoning model constrains the recognition process by framing queries according to what a pilot would expect during the execution of the current plan(s). Results from experiments involving the dMARS procedural reasoning system and the CLARET pattern matching and induction system are described for ...

Accelerating Reinforcement Learning through the Discovery of Useful Subgoals An ability to adjust to changing environments and unforeseen circumstances is likely to be an important component of a successful autonomous space robot. This paper shows how to augment reinforcement learning algorithms with a method for automatically discovering certain types of subgoals online. By creating useful new subgoals while learning, the agent is able to accelerate learning on a current task and to transfer its expertise to related tasks through the reuse of its ability to attain subgoals. Subgoals are created based on commonalities across multiple paths to a solution. We cast the task of finding these commonalities as a multiple-instance learning problem and use the concept of diverse density to find solutions. We introduced this approach in [10] and here we present additional results for a simulated mobile robot task.  1

Alternative Correctness Criteria for Multiversion Concurrency Control and a Locking Protocol via Freezing Concurrency control protocols based on multiversions have been used in some commercial transaction processing systems in order to provide the serializable executions of transactions. In the existing protocols, transactions are allowed to read only the most recent version of each data item in order to ensure the correct execution of transactions. However, this feature is not desirable in some advanced database systems which have more requirements such as timing or security constraints besides serializability. In this paper, we propose a new correctness criteria, called F-serializability, for multiversion concurrency control protocols. It is the extended definition of `1-serial' and relaxes the condition so that a protocol provides not only the most recent version but also the previous one to transactions, if necessary. We prove that whenever a multiversion schedule is F-serializable, the schedule is also one-copy serializable. This is the first contribution of our paper. Next, we propos...

Learning Hidden Markov Model Structure for Information Extraction Statistical machine learning techniques, while well proven in fields such as speech recognition, are just beginning to be applied to the information extraction domain. We explore the use of hidden Markov models for information extraction tasks, specifically focusing on how to learn model structure from data and how to make the best use of labeled and unlabeled data. We show that a manually-constructed model that contains multiple states per extraction field outperforms a model with one state per field, and discuss strategies for learning the model structure automatically from data. We also demonstrate that the use of distantly-labeled data to set model parameters provides a significant improvement in extraction accuracy. Our models are applied to the task of extracting important fields from the headers of computer science research papers, and achieve an extraction accuracy of 92.9%.

Building Cognitively Rich Agents Using The Sim Agent Toolkit Synthetic agents with varying degrees of intelligence and autonomy are being designed in many research laboratories. The motivations include military training simulations, games and entertainments, educational software, digital personal assistants, software agents managing Internet transactions or purely scientific curiosity. Different approaches are being explored, including, at one extreme, research on the interactions between agents, and at the other extreme research on processes within agents. The first approach focuses on forms of communication, requirements for consistent collaboration, planning of coordinated behaviours to achieve collaborative goals, extensions to logics of action and belief for multiple agents, and types of emergent phenomena when many agents interact, for instance taking routing decisions on a telecommunications network. The second approach focuses on the internal architecture of individual agents required for social interaction, collaborative behaviours, complex decision making, learning, and emergent phenomena within complex agents. Agents with complex internal structure may, for example, combine perception, motive generation, planning, plan execution, execution monitoring, and even emotional reactions.

Stratum Approaches to Temporal DBMS Implementation database interfaces, legacy systems. Previous approaches to implementing temporal DBMSs have assumed that a temporal DBMS must be built from scratch, employing an integrated architecture and using new temporal implementation techniques such as temporal indexes and join algorithms. However, this is a very large and time-consuming task. This paper explores approaches to implementing a temporal DBMS as a stratum on top of an existing non-temporal DBMS, rendering implementation more feasible by reusing much of the functionality of the underlying conventional DBMS. More specifically, the paper introduces three stratum meta-architectures, each with several specific architectures. Based on a new set of evaluation criteria, advantages and disadvantages of the specific architectures are identified. The paper also classifies all existing temporal DBMS implementations according to the specific architectures they employ. It is concluded that a stratum architecture is the best short, medium, and perhaps even longterm, approach to implementing a temporal DBMS. 1

Evaluating Topic-Driven Web Crawlers Due to limited bandwidth, storage, and computational resources, and to the dynamic nature of the Web, search engines cannot index every Web page, and even the covered portion of the Web cannot be monitored continuously for changes. Therefore it is essential to develop effective crawling strategies to prioritize the pages to be indexed. The issue is even more important for topic-specific search engines, where crawlers must make additional decisions based on the relevance of visited pages. However, it is difficult to evaluate alternative crawling strategies because relevant sets are unknown and the search space is changing. We propose three different methods to evaluate crawling strategies. We apply the proposed metrics to compare three topic-driven crawling algorithms based on similarity ranking, link analysis, and adaptive agents.

Scalable Consistency Protocols for Distributed Services Abstract√êA common way to address scalability requirements of distributed services is to employ server replication and client caching of objects that encapsulate the service state. The performance of such a system could depend very much on the protocol implemented by the system to maintain consistency among object copies. We explore scalable consistency protocols that never require synchronization and communication between all nodes that have copies of related objects. We achieve this by developing a novel approach called local consistency (LC). LC based protocols can provide increased flexibility and efficiency by allowing nodes control over how and when they become aware of updates to cached objects. We develop two protocols for implementing strong consistency using this approach and demonstrate that they scale better than a traditional invalidation based consistency protocol along the system load and geographic distribution dimensions of scale.

Query Optimization for Selections using Bitmaps Bitmaps are popular indexes for data warehouse (DW) applications and most database management systems offer them today. This paper proposes query optimization strategies for selections using bitmaps. Both continuous  and discrete selection criteria are considered. Query optimization strategies are categorized into static and dynamic. Static optimization strategies discussed are the optimal design of bitmaps, and algorithms based on tree and logical reduction. The dynamic optimization discussed is the approach of inclusion and exclusion for both bit-sliced indexes and encoded bitmap indexes.  1 Introduction  Bitmap indexing has become a promising technique for query processing in DWs. Variations of bitmap indexes include bit-sliced indexes [14, 3], encoded bitmap indexes (EBI) [18], bitmapped join indexes [13], range-based bitmap indexes [20], and others[16].

In this paper we investigate  on the update of the mental state of an hearer agent as a consequence of the utterance  performed by a speaker agent. Given an agent communication language with a STRIPSlike  semantics, we propose a set of criteria that allow to bind the speaker's mental state  to its uttering of a certain sentence. On the basis of these criteria, we give an abductive  procedure that the hearer can adopt to partially recognize the speaker's mental state that  led to a specific utterance. This procedure can be adopted by the hearer to update its own  mental state and its image of the speaker's mental state.  1 Introduction  In multi-agent systems, communication is necessary for the agents to cooperate and coordinate their activities or simply to avoid interfering with one another.

Preserving Contextual Navigation in Hypermedia Querying Navigating query results is a highly volatile task, usually requiring much effort from the users, while not providing a firm reference point for further queries or refinement. Many users accessing traditional search engines are confronted with lengthy pages of hypertext links, through which relevant information must be found. Accessing each link can bring a user closer or farther from the information they seek; in either case, the context between the query results and the current web page can be lost. Delaunay  MM  addresses these issues by creating virtual documents through which all query results are displayed in a meaningful and organized fashion; and that reference the originating web page, thus providing semantic browsing and hypermedia navigation without loss of context.

Supporting Dialogue Inferencing in Conversational Case-Based Reasoning . Dialogue inferencing is the knowledge-intensive process of inferring aspects of a user's problem from its partial description. Conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) systems, which interactively and incrementally elicit a user's problem description, suffer from poor retrieval efficiency (i.e., they prompt the user with questions that the user has already implicitly answered) unless they perform dialogue inferencing. The standard method for dialogue inferencing in CCBR systems requires library designers to supply explicit inferencing rules. This approach is problematic (e.g., maintenance is difficult). We introduce an alternative approach in which the CCBR system guides the library designer in building a domain model. This model and the partial problem description are then given to a query retrieval system (PARKA-DB) to infer any implied answers during a conversation. In an initial empirical evaluation in the NaCoDAE CCBR tool, our approach improved retrieval efficiency without sa...

An Architecture and Object Model for Distributed Object-Oriented Real-Time Databases The confluence of computers, communications, and databases is quickly creating a distributed database where many applications require real-time access to both temporally accurate and multimedia data. This is particularly true in military and intelligence applications, but these required features are needed in many commercial applications as well. We are developing a distributed database, called BeeHive, which could offer features along different types of requirements: real-time, fault-tolerance, security, and quality-of service for audio and video. Support of these features and potential trade-offs between them could provide a significant improvement in performance and functionality over current distributed database and object management systems. In this paper, we present a high level design for BeeHive architecture and sketch the design of the BeeHive Object Model (BOM) which extends object-oriented data models by incorporating time and other features into objects, resulting in a high...

A Conceptual Framework for Agent Definition and Development The use of agents of many different kinds in a variety of fields of computer science and  artificial intelligence is increasing rapidly and is due, in part, to their wide applicability. The  richness of the agent metaphor that leads to many different uses of the term is, however, both a  strength and a weakness: its strength lies in the fact that it can be applied in very many different  ways in many situations for different purposes; the weakness is that the term agent is now used so  frequently that there is no commonly accepted notion of what it is that constitutes an agent. This  paper addresses this issue by applying formal methods to provide a defining framework for agent  systems. The Z specification language is used to provide an accessible and unified formal account  of agent systems, allowing us to escape from the terminological chaos that surrounds agents. In  particular, the framework precisely and unambiguously provides meanings for common concepts  and terms, enables alternative models of particular classes of system to be described within it, and  provides a foundation for subsequent development of increasingly more refined concepts.

Principles for a Usability-Oriented Pattern Language High-level usability principles (e.g. "Familiarity") are difficult to apply to specific projects, and style guides providing more detailed instructions are often misinterpreted and inaccessible. An approach to usability based on design patterns enables designers to learn how certain recurring problems can be solved according to high-level principles. This paper summarises a review of the desirable properties advocated by five popular style guides, and discusses how this list has been modified to provide an underlying philosophy which is appropriate for a usability-oriented pattern language. A sample pattern which exemplifies this philosophy, involving iteration through selectable objects, is described. KEYWORDS Usability engineering, Design techniques, Style guides.  1.

Controlling Speculative Computation in Multi-Agent Environments In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system which performs speculative computation under incomplete communication environments. In a master-slave style multi-agent system with speculative computation, a master agent asks queries to slave agents in problem solving, and proceeds computation with default answers when answers from slave agents are delayed. We rst provide a semantics for speculative computation using default logic. Then, in the proposed system, we use the consequence- nding procedure SOL written in the Java language to perform data-driven deductive reasoning. The use of a consequence- nding procedure is convenient for updating agents' beliefs according to situation changes in the world. In our system, slave agents can change their answers frequently, yet a master agent can avoid duplicate computation. As long as actual answers from slave agents do not con- ict with any previously encountered situation, the obtained conclusions are never recomputed. We applied the proposed system to the meeting-room reservation problem to see the usefulness of the framework. 1

Learning to Catch: Applying Nearest Neighbor Algorithms to Dynamic Control Tasks Steven L. Salzberg  1  and David W. Aha  2 1 Introduction  Dynamic control problems are the subject of much research in machine learning (e.g., Selfridge, Sutton, & Barto, 1985; Sammut, 1990; Sutton, 1990). Some of these studies investigated the applicability of various k-nearest neighbor methods (Dasarathy, 1990) to solve these tasks by modifying control strategies based on previously gained experience (e.g., Connell & Utgoff, 1987; Atkeson, 1989; Moore, 1990; 1991). However, these previous studies did not highlight the fact that small changes in the design of these algorithms drastically alter their learning behavior. This paper describes a preliminary study that investigates this issue in the context of a difficult dynamic control task: learning to catch a ball moving in a three-dimensional space, an important problem in robotics research (Geng et al., 1991). Our thesis in this paper is that agents can improve substantially at physical tasks by storing experiences without explicitly...

Ensembles of Classifiers Based on Approximate Reducts . A problem of improving rough set based expert systems by  modifying a notion of reduct is discussed. A notion of approximate reduct  is introduced, as well as some proposals of quality measure for such a  reduct. A complete classifying system based on approximate reducts is  presented and discussed. It is proved that a problem of nding optimal set  of classifying agents based on approximate reducts is NP-hard; a genetic  algorithm is used to nd the suboptimal set. Experimental results show,  that the classifying system is eective and relatively fast.  1 Introduction  Rough set expert systems base on the notion of reduct [11], [12], a minimal subset of attributes which is sucient to discern between objects with dierent decision values. A set of short reducts can be used to generate rules [2]. A problem of short reducts generation is NP-hard, but an approximate algorithm (like the genetic one described in [13], [8] and implemented successfully { see [10]) can be used to obtain redu...

Cost Effective Mobile Agent Planning for Distributed Information Retrieval The number of agents' and the execution time are two significant performance factors' in mobile agent planning. Fewer agents' cause lower network traffic and consume less bandwidth. Regardless of the number of agents' used, the execution time for a task must be kept minimal, which means that use of the minimal number of agents' must not impact on the execution time unfavorably. As the population of the mobile agent application domain grows', the importance of these two factors' also increases.

Learning probabilistic Datalog rules for information classification and transformation Probabilistic Datalog is a combination of classical Datalog (i.e., function-free Horn clause predicate logic) with probability theory. Therefore, probabilistic weights may be attached to both facts and rules. But it is often impossible to assign exact rule weights or even to construct the rules themselves. Instead of specifying them manually, learning algorithms can be used to learn both rules and weights. In practice, these algorithms are very slow because they need a large example set and have to test a high number of rules. We apply a number of extensions to these algorithms in order to improve efficiency. Several applications demonstrate the power of learning probabilistic Datalog rules, showing that learning rules is suitable for low dimensional problems (e.g., schema mapping) but inappropriate for higher dimensions like e.g. in text classification.

Binary Decision Diagram Representations Of Firewall And Router Access Lists Network firewalls and routers can use a rule database to decide which packets will be allowed from one network onto another. By filtering packets the firewalls and routers can improve security and performance -- by excluding packets which may pose a security risk to a network or are not relevant to it. However, as the size of the rule list increases, it becomes difficult to maintain and validate the rules, and the cost of rule lookup may add significantly to latency. Ordered binary decision diagrams (BDDs) -- a compact method of representing and manipulating boolean expressions -- are a potential method of representing the rules. This paper explores how BDDs can be used to develop methods that help analysis of rules to validate them and changes to them, to improve performance, and facilitate hardware support.  1 Introduction  The growth of network and internet communication creates several challenges for network design. Two important issues are security and performance. As the volume o...

Collision Avoidance and Resolution Multiple Access for Multichannel Wireless Networks The CARMA-NTG protocol is presented and analyzed. CARMA-NTG dynamically divides the channel into cycles of variable length; each cycle consists of a contention period and a group-transmission period. During the contention period, a station with one or more packets to send competes for the right to be added to the group of stations allowed to transmit data without collisions; this is done using a collision resolution splitting algorithm based on a request-to-send/clear-to-send (RTS/CTS) message exchange with non-persistent carrier sensing. CARMA-NTG ensures that one station is added to the group transmission period if one or more stations send requests to be added in the previous contention period. The group-transmission period is a variable-length train of packets, which are transmitted by stations that have been added to the group by successfully completing an RTS/CTS message exchange in previous contention periods. As long as a station maintains its position in the group, it is able to transmit data packets without collision. An upper bound is derived for the average costs of obtaining the first success in the splitting algorithm. This bound is then applied to the computation of the average channel utilization in a fully connected network with a large number of stations. These results indicate that collision resolution is a powerful mechanism in combination with floor acquisition and group allocation multiple access. 1

Data Resource Selection in Distributed Visual Information Systems With the advances in multimedia databases and the popularization of the Internet, it is now possible to access large image and video repositories distributed throughout the world. One of the challenging problems in such an access is how the information in the respective databases can be summarized to enable an intelligent selection of relevant database sites based on visual queries. This paper presents an approach to solve this problem based on image content-based indexing of a metadatabase at a query distribution server. The metadatabase records a summary of the visual content of the images in each database through image templates and statistical features characterizing the similarity distributions of the images. The selection of the databases is done by searching the metadatabase using a ranking algorithm that uses query similarity to a template and the features of the databases associated with the template. Two selection approaches, termed mean-based and histogram-based approaches, ...

Centroid-Based Document Classification: Analysis & Experimental Results . In this paper we present a simple linear-time centroid-based document  classification algorithm, that despite its simplicity and robust performance,  has not been extensively studied and analyzed. Our experiments show that this  centroid-based classifier consistently and substantially outperforms other algorithms  such as Naive Bayesian, k-nearest-neighbors, and C4.5, on a wide range  of datasets. Our analysis shows that the similarity measure used by the centroidbased  scheme allows it to classify a new document based on how closely its behavior  matches the behavior of the documents belonging to different classes. This  matching allows it to dynamically adjust for classes with different densities and  accounts for dependencies between the terms in the different classes.  1 Introduction  We have seen a tremendous growth in the volume of online text documents available on the Internet, digital libraries, news sources, and company-wide intranets.

Nonstandard Concepts of Similarity in Case-Based Reasoning Introduction  The present paper is aimed at propagating new concepts of similarity more flexible and expressive than those underlying most case-based reasoning approaches today. So, it mainly deals with criticizing approaches in use, with motivating and introducing new notions and notations, and with first steps towards future applications. The investigations at hand originate from the author's work in learning theory. In exploring the relationship between inductive learning and case-based learning within a quite formal setting (cf. [Jan92b]), it turned out that both areas almost coincide, if sufficiently flexible similarity concepts are taken into acount. This provides some formal arguments for the necessity of non-symmetric similarity measures. Encouraged by these first results, the author tried to investigate more structured learning problems from the view point of case-based reasoning. It turned out that an appropriate handling requires formalisms allowing similarity concep

Rule-Based Query Optimization, Revisited We present an overview and initial performance assessment of a rule-based query optimizer written in VenusDB. VenusDB is an active-database rule language embedded in C++. Following the developments in extensible database query optimizers, first in rule-based form followed by optimizers written as object-oriented programs, the VenusDB optimizer avails the advantages of both. To date, development of rule-based query optimizers have included the definition and implementation of custom rule languages. Thus, extensibility required detailed understanding and often further development of the underlying search mechanism of the rule system. Objectoriented query optimizers appear to have achieved their goals with respect to a clear organization and encapsulation  of an optimizer's elements. They do not, however, provide for the concise, declarative expression of domain specific heuristics. Our experience demonstrates that a rule-based query optimizer developed in VenusDB can be well structured, ...

Multiversion Linear Quadtree for Spatio-Temporal Data Research in spatio-temporal databases has largely focused on extensions of access methods for the proper handling of time changing spatial information. In this paper, we present the Multiversion Linear Quadtree (MVLQ), a spatio-temporal access method based on Multiversion B-trees (MVBT) [2], embedding ideas from Linear Region Quadtrees [4]. More specifically, instead of storing independent numerical data having a different transaction-time each, for every consecutive image we store a group of codewords that share the same transaction-time, whereas each codeword represents a spatial subregion. Thus, the new structure may be used as an index mechanism for storing and accessing evolving raster images. We also conducted a thorough experimentation using sequences of real and synthetic raster images. In particular, we examined the time performance of temporal window queries, and provide results for a variety of parameter settings.

Mining Source Coverage Statistics for Data Integration Recent work in data integration has shown the importance of statistical information about the coverage and overlap of sources for efficient query processing. Despite this recognition there are no effective approaches for learning the needed statistics. The key challenge in learning such statistics is keeping the number of needed statistics low enough to have the storage and learning costs manageable. Naive approaches can become infeasible very quickly. In this paper we present a set of connected techniques that estimate the coverage and overlap statistics while keeping the needed statistics tightly under control. Our approach uses a hierarchical classification of the queries, and threshold based variants of familiar data mining techniques to dynamically decide the level of resolution at which to learn the statistics. We describe the details of our method, and present preliminary experimental results showing the feasibility of the approach.  1.

Bringing Robustness to End-User Programming In some cases, end-user programming allows the design of stand-alone applications. But none of the existing approaches is concerned by safety aspects of programming. Heavy techniques exist to develop safe applications, particularly in non-interactive domains. They involve software engineering techniques, and sometimes, formal methods. All these techniques are very far from end-users. Our idea is to let this part to experts, and to connect end-user programming onto this safe conventional development. Starting from an existing functional core, we built an interactive end-user programming environment called GenBuild, which allows designing interactive stand-alone applications. GenBuild allows the verification of some properties that are a first step towards the development of safe end-user programming.  1.

Learning Languages by Collecting Cases and Tuning Parameters . We investigate the problem of case-based learning of formal languages. Case-based reasoning and learning is a currently booming area of artificial intelligence. The formal framework for case-based learning of languages has recently been developed by [JL93] in an inductive inference manner. In this paper, we first show that any indexed class of recursive languages in which finiteness is decidable is case-based representable, but many classes of languages including the class of all regular languages are not case-based learnable with a fixed universal similarity measure, even if both positive and negative examples are presented. Next we consider a framework of case-based learning where the learning algorithm is allowed to learn similarity measures, too. To avoid trivial encoding tricks, we carefully examine to what extent the similarity measure is going to be learned. Then by allowing only to learn a few parameters in the similarity measures, we show that any indexed class of recursive ...

Building Behaviors Developmentally: A New Formalism This paper advocates a developmental approach to building complex interactive behaviors for robotic systems. A developmental methodology is advantageous because it provides a structured decomposition of complex tasks, because it facilitates learning, and because it allows for a gradual increase in task complexity. The developmental approach provides a structured means both of dividing a task among research units, as well as a metric for evaluating the progress of the task. Initial work with developmental modeling has also hinted that these skill decompositions may make the overall task easier to accomplish through the re-use of knowledge gained from developmental precursors. We report here on two projects of building behaviors developmentally for a humanoid robot. In the first project, the robot learned to reach to a visual target by following a developmental progression similar to those observed in infants.

Systems Directions for Pervasive Computing Pervasive computing, with its focus on users and their tasks rather than on computing devices and technology, provides an attractive vision for the future of computing. But, while hardware and networking infrastructure to realize this vision are becoming a reality, precious few applications run in this infrastructure. We believe that this lack of applications stems largely from the fact that it is currently too hard to design, build, and deploy applications in the pervasive computing space. In this paper, we argue that existing approaches to distributed computing are flawed along three axes when applied to pervasive computing; we sketch out alternatives that are better suited for this space. First, application data and functionality need to be kept separate, so that they can evolve gracefully in a global computing infrastructure. Second, applications need to be able to acquire any resource they need at any time, so that they can continuously provide their services in a highly dynamic environment. Third, pervasive computing requires a common system platform, allowing applications to be run across the range of devices and to be automatically distributed and installed. 1.

Coastal Navigation - Mobile Robot Navigation with Uncertainty in Dynamic Environments Ships often use the coasts of continents for navigation in the absence of better tools such as GPS, since being close to land allows sailors to determine with high accuracy where they are. Similarly for mobile robots, in many environments global and accurate localization is not always feasible. Environments can lack features, and dynamic obstacles such as people can confuse and block sensors. In this paper, we demonstrate a technique for generating trajectories that take into account both the information content of the environment, and the density of the people in the environment. These trajectories reduce the average positional certainty as the robot moves, reducing the likelihood the robot will become lost at any point. Our method was successfully implemented and used by the mobile robot Minerva, a museum tourguide robot, for a 2 week period in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. 1 Introduction  One essential component of any operational mobile robot system is the ab...

The KRAFT Architecture for Knowledge Fusion and Transformation This paper describes the KRAFT architecture which supports the fusion of knowledge  from multiple, distributed, heterogeneous sources. The architecture uses  constraints as a common knowledge interchange format, expressed against a common  ontology. Knowledge held in local sources can be tranformed into the common  constraint language, and fused with knowledge from other sources. The  fused knowledge is then used to solve some problem or deliver some information  to a user. Problem-solving in KRAFT typically exploits pre-existing constraint  solvers. KRAFT uses an open and flexible agent architecture in which knowledge  sources, knowledge fusing entities, and users are all represented by independent  KRAFT agents, communicating using a messaging protocol. Facilitator agents  perform matchmaking and brokerage services between the various kinds of agent.

Nonmonotonic Inheritance in Object-Oriented Deductive Database Languages Deductive object-oriented frameworks integrate logic rules and inheritance. There, specific problems arise: Due to the combination of deduction and inheritance, (a) deduction can take place depending on inherited facts, thus raising indirect conflicts, and (b) also the class hierarchy and-membership is subject to deduction. From this point of view, we investigate the application of the extension semantics of Default Logic to deductive object-oriented database languages. By restricting the problem to Horn programs and a special type of defaults tailored to the semantics of inheritance, a forwardchaining construction of extensions is possible. This construction is compared with a solution as implemented in the F-Logic system Florid which is based on a combination of classical deductive fixpoints and an inheritance-trigger mechanism. The paper is a condensed version of [MK98]. 1 Introduction  In deductive object-oriented database languages, a class hierarchy and nonmonotonic inheritance i...

An Algorithm to Evaluate Quantified Boolean Formulae and its Experimental Evaluation The high computational complexity of advanced reasoning tasks such as reasoning about knowledge and planning calls for efficient and reliable algorithms for reasoning problems harder than NP. In this paper we propose Evaluate, an algorithm for evaluating Quantified Boolean Formulae, a language that extends propositional logic in a way such that many advanced forms of propositional reasoning, e.g., circumscription, can be easily formulated as evaluation of a QBF. Algorithms for evaluation of QBFs are suitable for the experimental analysis on a wide range of complexity classes, a property not easily found in other formalisms.  Evaluate is based on a generalization of the Davis-Putnam procedure for SAT, and is guaranteed to work in polynomial space. Before presenting the algorithm, we discuss several abstract properties of QBFs that we singled out to make it more efficient. We also discuss various options that were investigated about heuristics and data structures, and report the main res...

Integrating Automatic Genre Analysis into Digital Libraries With the number and types of documents in digital library systems increasing, tools for automatically organizing and presenting the content have to be found. While many approaches focus on topic-based organization and structuring, hardly any system incorporates automatic structural analysis and representation. Yet, genre information (unconsciously) forms one of the most distinguishing features in conventional libraries and in information searches. In this paper we present an approach to automatically analyze the structure of documents and to integrate this information into an automatically created content-based organization. In the resulting visualization, documents on similar topics, yet representing dierent genres, are depicted as books in diering colors. This representation supports users intuitively in locating relevant information presented in a relevant form.

Localisation using Automatically Selected Landmarks from Panoramic Images The use of visual landmarks for robot localisation is a promising field. It is apparent that the success of localisation by visual landmarks depends on the landmarks chosen. Good landmarks are those which remain reliable over time and through changes in position and orientation.

An adaption of the biologically inspired Turn Back and Look behaviour is used to evaluate potential landmarks. Normalised correlation is used to overcome the a#ects of changes in illumination in the environment. Results from real robot experiments are reported, showing successful localisation from up to one meter away from the learnt position. 1 Introduction Visual localisation is one of the key problems in making successful autonomous robots.

Adaptation Techniques for Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Response Systems This paper examines techniques for providing adaptation in intrusion detection and intrusion response systems. As attacks on computer systems are becoming increasingly numerous and sophisticated, there is a growing need for intrusion detection and response systems to dynamically adapt to better detect and respond to attacks. The Adaptive Hierarchical Agentbased Intrusion Detection System (AHA!

This is accomplished by dynamically invoking new combinations of lower level detection agents in response to changing circumstances and by adjusting the confidence associated with these lower-level agents.

At the same time, there is an increasing need of exploiting database tools to manage this kind of data. An important novelty of XML is that information on document structures is available on the Web together with the document contents. This information can be used to improve document handling and to achieve more effective and efficient searches on documents. However, in such an heterogeneous environment as the Web, it is not reasonable to assume that XML documents that enter a source always conform to a predefined DTD present in the source.

Scheduling Queries on Tape-resident Data Advances in storage technology have made near-line tertiary storage a viable alternative for  database and data warehouse systems. Tertiary storage systems are employed in cases where secondary  storage can not satisfy the data handling requirements or tertiary storage is more cost effective  option. Tertiary storage devices have traditionally been used as archival storage. The new application  domains require on-demand retrieval of data from these devices. This paper investigates issues in  optimizing I/O time for a query whose data resides on automated tertiary storage containing multiple  storage devices.

Evolutionary Approaches to Off-Line Routing in Backbone Communications Networks Off-line routing in backbone communications networks is an important combinatorial optimisation problem. It has three main uses: first, off-line routing provides reference benchmark results for dynamic (on-line) routing strategies. Second, and more interestingly, off-line routing is becoming more and more investigated and employed in its own right as a way of quickly finding significantly improved routings for live networks which can then be imposed on the network to offer a net improvement in quality of service. Third, it can be used in networks where bandwidth may be booked in advance. In this paper we introduce and investigate a number of heuristic techniques applicable to the routing problem for use in stochastic, iterative search. Results are presented which indicate that these heuristics significantly improve the search for solutions, particularly when on-line performance is considered. We also investigate how computation time can be further reduced by the use of delta-evaluation...

Optimizing Object Queries Using an Effective Calculus Object-oriented databases (OODBs) provide powerful data abstractions and modeling facilities but they generally lack a suitable framework for query processing and optimization. One of the key factors for OODB systems to successfully compete with relational systems as well as to meet the performance requirements of many non-traditional applications is the development of an effective query optimizer. We propose an effective framework with a solid theoretical basis for optimizing OODB query languages. Our calculus, called the monoid comprehension calculus, captures most features of ODMG OQL and is a good basis for expressing various optimization algorithms concisely. This paper concentrates on query unnesting, an optimization that, even though improves performance considerably, is not treated properly (if at all) by most OODB systems.

A Unified View of Plans as Recipes Plans as recipes or abstract structures, as well as plans as mental attitudes that guide an agent in its planning process has been enthusiastically embraced by both philosophers and AI practitioners. They play a central role in a class of rational agents, called Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This dual view of plans can not only be used for efficient planning, but can also be used for recognizing the plans of other agents, coordinating one's actions and achieving joint intentions with other members of a larger collective or team, and finally recognizing the collective plans and intentions of other teams. In this paper, we start with a simple notion of execution plans and discuss its operational semantics. We progressively extend this notion of plans to recognition plans, joint execution plans, and joint recognition plans. The primary contribution of this paper is in providing an integrated view of plans that facilitate individual an collective planning and recognition.   1 Int...

Making LDAP Active with the LTAP Gateway: Case Study in Providing Telecom Integration and Enhanced Services LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) directories are being rapidly deployed on the Web. They are currently used to store data like white pages information, user profiles, and network device descriptions. These directories offer a number of advantages over current database technology in that they provide better support for heterogeneity and scalability. However, they lack some basic database functionality (e.g., triggers, transactions) that is crucial for Directory Enabled Networking (DEN) tasks like provisioning network services, allocating resources, reporting, managing end-to-end security, and offering mobile users customized features that follow them. In order to address these limitations while keeping the simplicity and performance features of LDAP directories, unbundled and portable solutions are needed. In this paper we discuss LDAP limitations we faced while building an LDAP meta-directory that integrates data from legacy telecom systems, and how LTAP (Lightweight Trigger Access Process), a portable gateway that adds active functionality to LDAP directories, overcomes these limitations.

Textural Features for Image Database Retrieval This paper presents two feature extraction methods and two decision methods to retrieve images having some section in them that is like the user input image. The features used are variances of gray level co-occurrences and line-angle-ratio statistics constituted by a 2-D histogram of angles between two intersecting lines and ratio of mean gray levels inside and outside the regions spanned by those angles. The decision method involves associating with any pair of images either the class ‚Äúrelevant‚Äù or ‚Äúirrelevant‚Äù. A Gaussian classifier and nearest neighbor classifier are used. A protocol that translates a frame throughout every image to automatically define for any pair of images whether they are in the relevance class or the irrelevance class is discussed. Experiments on a database of 300 gray scale images with 9,600 groundtruth image pairs showed that the classifier assigned 80 % of the image pairs we were sure were relevant, to the relevance class correctly. The actual retrieval accuracy is greater than this lower bound of 80%.

Basically, original feature space of a content-based retrieval system is nonlinearly transformed into a new space, where the distance between the feature vectors is adjusted by learning. The transformation is realized by Artificial Neural Network architecture. A cost function is defined for learning and optimized by simulated annealing method. Experiments are done on the texture image retrieval system, which use Gabor Filter features. The results indicate that configured image retrieval system is significantly better than the original system. 1.

STHoles: A Multidimensional Workload-Aware Histogram Attributes of a relation are not typically independent. Multidimensional histograms can be an effective tool for accurate multiattribute query selectivity estimation. In this paper, we introduce STHoles,a\workload-aware" histogram that allows bucket nesting to capture data regions with reasonably uniform tuple density. STHoles histograms are built without examining the data sets, but rather by just analyzing query results. Buckets are allocated where needed the most as indicated by the workload, which leads to accurate query selectivity estimations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STHoles histograms consistently produce good selectivity estimates across synthetic and real-world data sets and across query workloads, and, in many cases, outperform the best multidimensional histogram techniques that require access to and processing of the full data sets during histogram construction. 1.

A New TWIST on Mobile Computing: Two-Way Interactive Session Transfer The ubiquitous use of computer resources for daily productivity is a goal that presently remains unrealised. We believe that the convergence of desktop and mobile applications into a seamless computing experience will provide a strong motivation for future "anytime, anywhere computing." In this paper we describe this convergence as the capability to perform the handoff of application sessions across heterogeneous platforms using the network as a conduit. In addition to discussing the architecture and protocols to facilitate this capability, in this paper we also provide a taxonomy for describing a variety of different session handoff schemes. In particular, we have identified an important Two-Way Interactive Session Transfer (TWIST) behaviour for communication between heterogeneous clients and servers. To demonstrate our concepts, we have implemented the handoff capability with TWIST semantics into a real-world application that serves as a teaching tool for radiology clinicians. From experimental data we will show that the handoff mechanism incurs little delay to transfer large dataladen sessions.  1

Beyond Fitts' Law: Models for Trajectory-Based HCI Tasks Trajectory-based interactions, such as navigating through nested-menus, drawing curves, and moving in 3D worlds, are becoming common tasks in modern computer interfaces. Users' performances in these tasks cannot be successfully modeled with Fitts' law as it has been applied to pointing tasks. Therefore we explore the possible existence of robust regularities in trajectory-based tasks. We used "steering through tunnels" as our experimental paradigm to represent such tasks, and found that a simple "steering law" indeed exists. The paper presents the motivation, analysis, a series of four experiments, and the applications of the steering law.

Indexing Semistructured Data This paper describes techniques for building and exploiting indexes on semistructured data: data that may not have a fixed schema and that may be irregular or incomplete. We first present a general framework for indexing values in the presence of automatic type coercion. Then based on  Lore, a DBMS for semistructured data, we introduce four types of indexes and illustrate how they are used during query processing. Our techniques and indexing structures are fully implemented and integrated into the Lore prototype. 1 Introduction  We call data that is irregular or that exhibits type and structural heterogeneity semistructured,  since it may not conform to a rigid, predefined schema. Such data arises frequently on the Web, or when integrating information from heterogeneous sources. In general, semistructured data can be neither stored nor queried in relational or object-oriented database management systems easily and efficiently. We are developing Lore  1  , a database management system d...

Discovering Interesting Association Rules in Medical Data We are presently exploring the idea of discovering association rules in medical data. There are several technical aspects which make this problem challenging. In our case medical data sets are small, but have high dimensionality. Information content is rich: there exist numerical, categorical, time and even image attributes. Data records are generally noisy. We explain how to map medical data to a transaction format suitable for mining rules. The combinatorial nature of association rules matches our needs, but current algorithms are unsuitable for our purpose. We thereby introduce an improved algorithm to discover association rules in medical data which incorporates several important constraints. Some interesting results obtained by our program are discussed and we explain how the program parameters were set. We believe many of the problems we come across are likely to appear in other domains.  1 Introduction  Data Mining is an active research area. One of the most popular approaches t...

MARIAN: Flexible Interoperability for Federated Digital Libraries Federated digital libraries are composed of distributed autonomous (heterogeneous) information services but provide users with a transparent, integrated view of collected information ‚Äì respecting different information sources‚Äô autonomy. In this paper we discuss a federated system for the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD), an international consortium of universities, libraries, and other supporting institutions focused on electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). The NDLTD has so far allowed its members considerable autonomy, though agreements are developing on metadata standards and on support of the Open Archives initiative that eventually will promote greater homogeneity. At present, federation requires dealing flexibly with differences among systems, ontologies, and data formats. Our solution involves adapting MARIAN, an objectoriented digital library retrieval system developed with support by NLM and NSF, to serve as mediation middleware for the federated NDLTD collection. Components of the solution include: 1) the use of several harvesting techniques; 2) an architecture based on object-oriented ontologies of search modules and metadata; 3) diversity within the harvested data joined to a single collection view for the user; and 4) an integrated framework for addressing such questions as data quality, information compression, and flexible search. The system can handle very large dynamic collections. An adaptable relationship between the collection view and harvested data facilitates adding new sites to the federation and adapting to changes in existing sites. MARIAN‚Äôs modular architecture and powerful and flexible data model work together to build an effective integrated solution within a simple uniform framework. We present both the general design of the system and operational details of a preliminary federated collection involving several thousand ETDs in four different formats and two languages from USA and Europe.

Visual Contextual Awareness in Wearable Computing Small, body-mounted video cameras enable a different style of wearable computing interface. As processing power increases, a wearable computer can spend more time observing its user to provide serendipitous information, manage interruptions and tasks, and predict future needs without being directly commanded by the user. This paper introduces an assistant for playing the real-space game Patrol. This assistant tracks the wearer's location and current task through computer vision techniques and without off-body infrastructure. In addition, this paper continues augmented reality research, started in 1995, for binding virtual data to physical locations. 1.

Task Models, Intentions, and Agent Conversation Policies . It is possible to define conversation policies, such as communication  or dialogue protocols, that are based strictly on what messages and,  respectively, what performatives may follow each other. While such an  approach has many practical applications, such protocols support only "local  coherence" in a conversation. Lengthy message exchanges require some  infrastructure to lend them "global coherence." Recognition of agent intentions  about the joint task is essential for this global coherence, but there are further  mechanisms needed to ensure that both local and global coherence are jointly  maintained. This paper presents a general yet practical approach to designing,  managing, and engineering agents that can do simple run-time intention  recognition without creating complex multi-state protocols. In this approach we  promote developing abstract task models and designing conversation policies  in terms of such models. An implemented agent assistant based on these ideas is  brie...

Knowledge Modeling - State of the Art A major characteristic of developments in the broad field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) during the 1990s has been an increasing integration of AI with other disciplines. A number of other computer science fields and technologies have been used in developing intelligent systems, starting from traditional information systems and databases, to modern distributed systems and the Internet. This paper surveys knowledge modeling techniques that have received most attention in recent years among developers of intelligent systems, AI practitioners and researchers. The techniques are described from two perspectives, theoretical and practical. Hence the first part of the paper presents major theoretical and architectural concepts, design approaches, and research issues. The second part discusses several practical systems, applications, and ongoing projects that use and implement the techniques described in the first part. Finally, the paper briefly covers some of the most recent results in the fields of intelligent manufacturing systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and ontologies.  2 1.

Coverage Problems in Wireless Ad-hoc Sensor Networks Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks have recently emerged as a premier research topic. They have great long term economic potential, ability to transform our lives, and pose many new system building challenges. Sensor networks also pose a number of new conceptual and optimization problems. Some, such as location, deployment, and tracking, are fundamental issues, in that many applications rely on them for needed information.  In this paper, we address one of the fundamental problems, namely coverage. Coverage in general, answers the questions about quality of service (surveillance) that can be provided by a particular sensor network. We first define the coverage problem from several points of view including deterministic, statistical, worst and best case, and present examples in each domain. By combining computational geometry and graph theoretic techniques, specifically the Voronoi diagram and graph search algorithms, we establish the main highlight of the paper - optimal polynomial time worst and average case algorithm for coverage calculation. We also present comprehensive experimental results and discuss future research directions related to coverage in sensor networks.  I.

Run-time Detection in Parallel and Distributed Systems: An Application to Safety-Critical Applications As systems are becoming more complex, there is increasing interest in their runtime analysis, understanding their dynamic behavior and possibly controling it as well. This paper describes complex distributed and parallel applications that use run-time analyses to attain scalability improvements with respect to the amount and complexity of the data transmitted, transformed, and shared among different application components. Such improvements are derived from using database techniques when manipulating data streams. Namely, by imposing a relational model on a data stream, filters and constraints on the stream may be expressed in the form of database queries evaluated against the data events comprising the stream. Streams may then be filtered using runtime optimization techniques derived from query optimization methods. This paper also presents a tool, termed Cnet, which offers (1) means for the dynamic creation of queries and their application to distributed data streams, (2) permits the...

We explain that using this technique, programs can be "specialised" w.r.t. a set of unit clauses instead of a query. Moreover, examples indicate that excellent specialisation can be obtained when this bottom up transformation is combined with a more traditional top down approach, resulting in conceptually cleaner techniques requiring a less complicated control than one overall approach.  1

Learning and Decision-Making in the Framework of Fuzzy Lattices A novel theoretical framework is delineated for supervised and unsupervised learning. It is called framework of fuzzy lattices, or FLframework for short, and it suggests mathematically sound tools for dealing separately and/or jointly with disparate types of data including vectors of numbers, fuzzy sets, symbols, etc. Specific schemes are proposed for clustering and classification having the capacity to deal with both missing and don't care data values; the schemes in question can be implemented as neural networks. The proposed learning schemes are employed here for pattern recognition on seven data sets including benchmark data sets, and the results are compared with those ones by various learning techniques from the literature. Finally, aiming at a mutual cross-fertilization, the FL-framework is associated with established theories for learning and/or decision-making including probability theory, fuzzy set theory, Bayesian decision-making, theory of evidence, and adaptive resonance t...

A Description Logic for Vague Knowledge This work introduces the concept language ALCFM which is an extension of ALC to many-valued logics. ALCFM allows to express vague concepts, e.g. more or less enlarged or very small. To realize this extension to many-valued logics, the classical notions of satisfiability and subsumption had to be modified appropriately. For example, ALCFM -concepts are no longer either satisfiable or unsatisfiable, but they are satisfiable to a certain degree. The main contribution of this paper is a sound and complete method for computing the degree of subsumption between two  ALCFM -concepts. 1 Introduction  This work takes its motivation from the occurrence of vague concept descriptions in different application areas. Often, application--inherent information is characterized by a very high degree of vagueness. Appropriate information systems must be able to process this kind of data. So far, there are no systems that really solve the corresponding problems due to the lack of powerful basic methods. A...

Towards Robust Teams with Many Agents Agents in deployed multi-agent systems monitor other agents to coordinate and collaborate robustly. However, as the number of agents monitored is scaled up, two key challenges arise: (i) the number of monitoring hypotheses to be considered can grow exponentially in the number of agents; and (ii) agents become physically and logically unconnected (unobservable) to their peers. This paper examines these challenges in teams of cooperating agents, focusing on a monitoring task that is of particular importance to robust teamwork: detecting disagreements among team-members. We present YOYO, a highly scalable disagreement-detection algorithm which guarantees sound detection in time linear in the number of agents despite the exponential number of hypotheses. In addition, we present new upper bounds about the number of agents that must be monitored in a team to guarantee disagreement detection. Both YOYO and the new bounds are explored analytically and empirically in thousands of monitoring problems, scaled to thousands of agents.

Building such applications involved acquiring valuable telecommunication knowledge from human experts and then applying this knowledge, typically by embedding it in an expert system. This knowledge acquisition process is so time-consuming that it is referred to as the "knowledge acquisition bottleneck". Data mining techniques are now being applied to industrial applications to break this bottleneck, by replacing the manual knowledge acquisition process with automated knowledge discovery. Telecommunication networks, which routinely generate tremendous amounts of data, are ideal candidates for data mining [1].

Artistic standards must be maintained while permitting substantial variability in story scenario. To achieve these objectives, scripted dialog is deconstructed into elements that are portrayed by agents with emotion models. Learners influence how the drama unfolds by controlling the intentions of one or more characters, who then behave in accordance with those intentions. Interactions between characters create opportunities to move the story in pedagogically useful directions, which the automated director exploits.

Leveraging Mediator Cost Models with Heterogeneous Data Sources : Distributed systems require declarative access to diverse data sources of information. One approach to solving this heterogeneous distributed database problem is based on mediator architectures. In these architectures, mediators accept queries from users, process them with respect to wrappers, and return answers. Wrapper provide access to underlying data sources. To efficiently process queries, the mediator must optimize the plan used for processing the query. In classical databases, cost-estimate based query optimization is an effective method for optimization. In a heterogeneous distributed databases, cost-estimate based query optimization is difficult to achieve because the underlying data sources do not export cost information. This paper describes a new method that permits the wrapper programmer to export cost estimates (cost estimate formulas and statistics). For the wrapper programmer to describe all cost estimates may be impossible due to lack of information or burdensome due...

For example, consumers may want to access product information on available desktops, laptops, software, and other accessories and check availability and pricing information. In addition, users may also want to access other online sources for related background information such as consumer reports, press releases etc. This situation is depicted in Figure 1.

Adding Some Smartness to Devices and Everyday Things In mobile computing, context-awareness indicates the ability of a system to obtain and use information on aspects of the system environment. To implement contextawareness, mobile system components have to be augmented with the ability to capture aspects of their environment. Recent work has mostly considered locationawareness, and hence augmentation of mobile artifacts with locality. In this paper we discuss augmentation of mobile artifacts with diverse sets of sensors and perception techniques for awareness of context beyond location. We report experience from two projects, one on augmentation of mobile phones with awareness technologies, and the other on embedding of awareness technology in everyday non-digital artifacts.

Software Infrastructure for Ubiquitous Computing Environments: Supporting Synchronous Collaboration with Heterogeneous Devices In ubiquitous computing environments, multiple users work with a wide range of different devices. In many cases, users interact and collaborate using multiple heterogeneous devices at the same time. The configuration of the devices should be able to change frequently due to a highly dynamic, flexible and mobile nature of new work practices. This produces new requirements for the architecture of an appropriate software infrastructure. In this paper, an architecture designed to meet these requirements is proposed. To test its applicability, this architecture was used as the basis for the implementation of BEACH, the software infrastructure of i-LAND (the ubiquitous computing environment at GMD-IPSI). It provides the functionality for synchronous cooperation and interaction with roomware components, i.e. room elements with integrated information technology.

Dynamic User Model Construction with Bayesian Networks for Intelligent Information Queries The complexity of current software applications is overwhelming users. The need exists for intelligent interface agents to address the problems of increasing taskload that is overwhelming the human user. Interface agents could help alleviate user taskload by extracting and analyzing relevant information, and providing information abstractions of that information, and providing timely, beneficial assistance to users. Central to providing assistance to a user is the issue of correctly determining the user's intent. The Clavin project is to build an intelligent natural language query information management system. Clavin must maintain a dynamic user model of the relevant concepts in the user inquiries as they relate to the information sources.

RF*IPF: A Weighting Scheme for Multimedia Information Retrieval Region-based approach has become a popular research trend in the field of multimedia database retrieval. In this paper, we present the Region Frequency and Inverse Picture Frequency (RF*IPF) weighting, a measure developed to unify region-based multimedia retrieval systems with textbased information retrieval systems. The weighting measure gives the highest weight to regions that occur often in a small number of images in the database. These regions are considered discriminators. With this weighting measure, we can blend image retrieval techniques with TF*IDFbased text retrieval techniques for large-scale Web applications. The RF*IPF weighting has been implemented as a part of our experimental SIMPLIcity image retrieval system and tested on a database of about 200,000 general-purpose images. Experiments have shown that this technique is effective in discriminating images of different semantics. Additionally, the overall similarity approach enables a simple querying interface for multimedia information retrieval systems. 1

Optimizing Large Join Queries in Mediation Systems In data integration systems, queries posed to a mediator need to be translated into a sequence of queries to the underlying data sources. In a heterogeneous environment, with sources of diverse and limited query capabilities, not all the translations are feasible. In this paper, we study the problem of finding feasible and efficient query plans for mediator systems. We consider conjunctive queries on mediators and model the source capabilities through attribute-binding adornments. We use a simple cost model that focuses on the major costs in mediation systems, those involved with sending queries to sources and getting answers back. Under this metric, we develop two algorithms for source query sequencing -- one based on a simple greedy strategy and another based on a partitioning scheme. The first algorithm produces optimal plans in some scenarios, and we show a linear bound on its worst case performance when it misses optimal plans. The second algorithm generates optimal plans in more scenarios, while having no bound on the margin by which it misses the optimal plans. We also report on the results of the experiments that study the performance of the two algorithms.

A Bayesian Computer Vision System for Modeling Human Interactions Abstract√êWe describe a real-time computer vision and machine learning system for modeling and recognizing human behaviors in a visual surveillance task [1]. The system is particularly concerned with detecting when interactions between people occur and classifying the type of interaction. Examples of interesting interaction behaviors include following another person, altering one's path to meet another, and so forth. Our system combines top-down with bottom-up information in a closed feedback loop, with both components employing a statistical Bayesian approach [2]. We propose and compare two different state-based learning architectures, namely, HMMs and CHMMs for modeling behaviors and interactions. The CHMM model is shown to work much more efficiently and accurately. Finally, to deal with the problem of limited training data, a synthetic ¬™Alife-style¬∫ training system is used to develop flexible prior models for recognizing human interactions. We demonstrate the ability to use these a priori models to accurately classify real human behaviors and interactions with no additional tuning or training.

Exploring Brick-Based Camera Control Introduction  BUILD-IT is a planning tool based on computer vision technology, with a capacity for complex planning and composition tasks (Rauterberg et al. 1997). The system enables users, grouped around a table, to interact in a virtual scene, using real bricks to select and manipulate objects in the scene (Fig. 1, left). A plan view of the scene is projected onto the table. A perspective view of the scene, called side view, is projected on the wall. The plan view contains a storage space with originals, allowing users to select new objects. Object selection is done by putting a brick at the object position. Once selected, objects can be positioned, rotated and fixed by simple brick manipulation (Fig. 1, right). They are de-selected, and stay put, when the brick is covered or removed. Objects brought back to the storage space are deleted.  Figure 1: BUILD-IT offers a plan view for combined action and perception, and a<F1

Probabilistic Roadmap Methods are Embarrassingly Parallel In this paper we report on our experience parallelizing probabilistic roadmap motion planning methods (prms). We show that significant, scalable speedups can be obtained with relatively little effort on the part of the developer. Our experience is not limited to prms, however. In particular, we outline general techniques for parallelizing types of computations commonly performed in motion planning algorithms, and identify potential difficulties that might be faced in other efforts to parallelize sequential motion planning methods. 1 Introduction  Automatic motion planning has application in many areas such as robotics, virtual reality systems, and computer-aided design. Although many different motion planning methods have been proposed, most are not used in practice since they are computationally infeasible except for some restricted cases, e.g., when the robot has very few degrees of freedom (dof) [12, 16]. Indeed, there is strong evidence that any complete planner (one that is guaran...

A Neural Network Model for Monotonic Diagnostic Problem Solving The task of diagnosis is to find a hypothesis that best explains a set of manifestations (observations). Generally, it is computationally expensive to find a hypothesis because the number of the potential hypotheses is exponentially large. Recently, many efforts have been made to find parallel processing methods to solve the above difficulty. In this paper, we propose a neural network model for diagnostic problem solving where a diagnostic problem is treated as a combinatorial optimisation problem. One feature of the model is that the causal network is directly used as the network. Another feature is that the errors between the observations and the current activations of manifestation nodes are used to guide the network computing for finding optimal diagnostic hypotheses.   1 Introduction  For a set of manifestations(observations), the diagnostic inference is to find the most plausible faults or disorders which can explain why the manifestations are present.

Speech/Gesture Interface to a Visual Computing Environment for Molecular Biologists In recent years there has been tremendous progress in 3D, immersive display and virtual reality (VR) technologies. Scientific visualization of data is one of many applications that has benefited from this progress.

The interface augments an existing application, VMD, which is a VR visual computing environment for molecular biologists. The free hand gestures are used for manipulating the 3-D graphical display together with a set of speech commands. We concentrate on the visual gesture analysis techniques used in developing this interface. The dual modality of gesture/speech is found to greatly aid the interaction capability....

Personal agents keep models of  student preferences and negotiate on their behalf to acquire resources (help)  from other agents. We model negotiation among personal agents by means of  influence diagram, a decision theoretic tool. To cope with the uncertainty  inherent in a dynamic market with self-interested participants, the agents create  models of their opponents during negotiation, which help them predict better  their opponents' actions. We carried out experiments comparing the proposed  negotiation mechanism with influence diagram, one using in addition a model  of t...

An On-Line EM Algorithm Applied to Kernel PCA Kernel principal component analysis (Pca) is a recent method for non-linear feature extraction. Applying kernel Pca to a data set with N patterns requires storing and nding the eigenvectors of a N N kernel matrix. This paper describes how an Expectation-Maximization (Em) algorithm for standard Pca can be adapted to kernel Pca without having to store the kernel matrix. Experimental results are given where Em for kernel Pca extracts up to 512 non-linear features from a data set with 15,000 examples. The extracted features lead to good performance when used as pre-processed data for a linear classifier. A novel on-line Em algorithm for Pca is presented and shown to further speed up the learning process.

Virtual Enterprise Design - BDI Agents vs. Objects Current research identifying architectures for a virtual enterprise has moved from information modelling to role modelling. Thus, a high level of autonomy results from the distribution of responsibilities, capabilities, and knowledge among different business units in the virtual enterprise at the design stage. Current trends tend towards using object-oriented technology as an effective abstract system design and implementation methodology. We argue that applying the software agent paradigm to the virtual enterprise provides various advantages on both the design and operational levels. We further show that the Belief Desire Intention agent architecture has additional abilities of mapping real world business unit autonomy and interaction. We also introduce the Belief Desire Intention agent paradigm capability of facilitating highly flexible (agile) enterprise design and implementation. 1

Discovering Unexpected Information from Your Competitors' Web Sites Ever since the beginning of the Web, finding useful information from the Web has been an important problem. Existing approaches include keyword-based search, wrapper-based information extraction, Web query and user preferences. These approaches essentially find information that matches the user's explicit specifications. This paper argues that this is insufficient. There is another type of information that is also of great interest, i.e., unexpected information, which is unanticipated by the user. Finding unexpected information is useful in many applications. For example, it is useful for a company to find unexpected information about its competitors, e.g., unexpected services and products that its competitors offer. With this information, the company can learn from its competitors and/or design counter measures to improve its competitiveness. Since the number of pages of a typical commercial site is very large and there are also many relevant sites (competitors), it is very difficult for a human user to view each page to discover the unexpected information. Automated assistance is needed. In this paper, we propose a number of methods to help the user find various types of unexpected information from his/her competitors' Web sites. Experiment results show that these techniques are very useful in practice and also efficient.  Keywords  Information interestingness, Web comparison, Web mining.  1.

Evaluation of Recommender Algorithms for an Internet Information Broker Based Association rules are a widely used technique to generate recommendations in commercial and research recommender systems. Since more and more Web sites, especially of retailers, offer automatic recommender services using Web usage mining, evaluation of recommender algorithms becomes increasingly important. In this paper we first present a framework for the evaluation of different aspects of recommender systems based on the process of discovering knowledge in databases of Fayyad et al. and then we focus on the comparison of the performance of two recommender algorithms based on frequent itemsets. The first recommender algorithm uses association rules, and the other recommender algorithm is based on the repeat-buying theory known from marketing research. For the evaluation we concentrated on how well the patterns extracted from usage data match the concept of useful recommendations of users. We use 6 month of usage data from an educational Internet information broker and compare useful recommendations identified by users from the target group of the broker with the results of the recommender algorithms. The results of the evaluation presented in this paper suggest that frequent itemsets from purchase histories match the concept of useful recommendations expressed by users with satisfactory accuracy (higher than 70%) and precision (between 60% and 90%). Also the evaluation suggests that both algorithms studied in the paper perform similar on real-world data if they are tuned properly.

Self-Supervised Learning for Visual Tracking and Recognition of Human Hand Due to the large variation and richness of visual inputs, statistical learning gets more and more concerned in the practice of visual processing such as visual tracking and recognition. Statistical models can be trained from a large set of training data. However, in many cases, since it is not trivial to obtain a large labeled and representative training data set, it would be difficult to obtain a satisfactory generalization. Another difficulty is how to automatically select good features for representation. By combining both labeled and unlabeled training data, this paper proposes a new learning paradigm, selfsupervised learning, to investigate the issues of learning bootstrapping and model transduction. Inductive learning and transductive learning are the two main cases of self-supervised learning, in which the proposed algorithm, Discriminant-EM (D-EM), is a specific learning technique.

Building a Machine Learning Based Text Understanding System Text understanding systems are approaching the  point of being a practical technology as long as the  system is trained for a narrowly defined domain.  Machine learning and statistical approaches can  minimize the effort involved in adapting a text  understanding system to a new domain.  This paper presents a system whose goal is deep  understanding, limited only by the necessity of  designing a formal representation of the target  concepts relevant to the domain. This system is an  advance over previous machine learning based  systems because of its richer output representation,  and an advance over equally expressive text  understanding systems because of its more  extensive use of machine learning.  1 Information Extraction from Free Text  A variety of systems have been developed in recent years that extract information from text.

Based on traces from search engines we show that there is significant locality in the queries asked, that is, 20-30% of the queries have been previously submitted by the same or a different user. Using trace-driven simulation we show that medium-sized caches can hold most of the frequently-submitted queries. Finally, we propose and evaluate a new cache replacement algorithm named LRU-2S, that takes into account both the frequency and the recency of access to a page when making a replacement decision.

A Tableau-Based Proof Method for Temporal Logics of Knowledge and Belief . In this paper we define two logics, KLn and BLn , and present tableau-based decision procedures for both. KLn is a temporal logic of knowledge. Thus, in addition to the usual connectives of linear discrete temporal logic, it contains a set of unary modal connectives for representing the knowledge  possessed by agents. The logic BLn is somewhat similar; it is a temporal logic that contains connectives for representing the beliefs of agents. In addition to a complete formal definition of the two logics and their decision procedures, the paper includes a brief review of their applications in AI and mainstream computer science, correctness proofs for the decision procedures, a number of worked examples illustrating the decision procedures, and some pointers to further work.

Active Learning for Natural Language Parsing and Information Extraction In natural language acquisition, it is difficult to gather the annotated data needed for supervised learning; however, unannotated data is fairly plentiful. Active learning methods attempt to select for annotation and training only the most informative examples, and therefore are potentially very useful in natural language applications. However, existing results for active learning have only considered standard classification tasks. To reduce annotation effort while maintaining accuracy, we apply active learning to two non-classification tasks in natural language processing: semantic parsing and information extraction. We show that active learning can significantly reduce the number of annotated examples required to achieve a given level of performance for these complex tasks.

SNePS: A Logic for Natural Language Understanding and Commonsense Reasoning The use of logic for knowledge representation and reasoning systems is controversial. There are, indeed, several ways that standard First Order Predicate Logic is inappropriate for modelling natural language understanding and commonsense reasoning. However, a more appropriate logic can be designed. This chapter presents several aspects of such a logic.  1 Introduction  My colleagues, students, and I have been engaged in a long-term project to build a natural language using intelligent agent. While our approach to natural language understanding (NLU) and commonsense reasoning (CSR) has been logic-based, we have thought that the logics developed for metamathematics, e.g. (Kleene, 1950), are not the best ones for our purpose. Instead, we have designed new logics, better suited for NLU and CSR. The current version of these logics constitutes the formal language and inference mechanism of the knowledge representation/reasoning (KRR) system, SNePS 2.4 (Shapiro and The SNePS Implementation Gr...

Diagnosis and Decision Making in Normative Reasoning . Diagnosis theory reasons about incomplete knowledge and only considers the past. It distinguishes between violations and non-violations. Qualitative decision theory reasons about decision variables and considers the future. It distinguishes between fulfilled goals and unfulfilled goals. In this paper we formalize normative diagnoses and decisions in the special purpose formalism  DIO(DE)  2  as well as in extensions of the preference-based deontic logic PDL. The DIagnostic and  DEcision-theoretic framework for DEontic reasoning DIO(DE)  2  formalizes reasoning about violations and fulfillments, and is used to characterize the distinction between normative diagnosis theory and (qualitative) decision theory. The extension of the preference-based deontic logic PDL shows how normative diagnostic and decision-theoretic reasoning -- i.e. reasoning about violations and fulfillments -- can be formalized as an extension of deontic reasoning. 1.

Autonomous Agents For Business Process Management : Traditional approaches to managing business processes are often inadequate for large-scale, organisation -wide, dynamic settings. However since Internet and Intranet technologies have become widespread, an increasing number of business processes exhibit these properties. Therefore a new approach is needed. To this end, we describe the motivation, conceptualisation, design and implementation of a novel agent-based business process management system. The key advance of our system is that responsibility for enacting various components of the business process is delegated to a number of autonomous problem solving agents. To enact their role, these agents typically interact and negotiate with other agents in order to coordinate their actions and to buy in the services they require. This approach leads to a system that is significantly more agile and robust than its traditional counterparts. To help demonstrate these benefits, a companion paper describes the application of our system to a ...

First-order expressivity for S5-models: modal vs. two-sorted languages this paper we are going to prove some results on the expressive power of the standard first-order modal language by comparing it with its extensional counterpart. We thereby restrict our attention to the case where the modal language is interpreted on S5-models. Moreover, we decided to deal exclusively with constant domain models, that is with models in which the domains of all worlds are the same. It is worth mentioning, however, that our method can be applied to logics based on varying domain models as well. Before we describe the results of this paper in more detail, we hasten to add that there exists some work done by other authors to which our results are related. In [8, 9, 10] Fine proves, among other things, a number of preservation results for modal first-order formulas which are relevant for certain philosophical distinctions. For instance, he provides a semantical characterization of de dicto formulas (within S5) and investigates conditions under which de re formulas are eliminable in certain extensions of S5 (see also [6, 18]). In [3] it was shown 2  that a remarkable portion of classical model theory can be transferred to the domain of modal logic. More closely related to our work are [14] and [15]. They discuss a number of formulas from the two-sorted language that are not expressible in the modal language.

Active Perception and Map Learning for Robot Navigation This paper describes a simulated on-line mapping system for robot navigation. This system allows the autonomous creation of topological maps enhanced with metrical information provided by internal (odometry) and external (vision and sonars) sensors. Within such maps, the robot's position is represented and calculated probabilistically according to algorithms that are inspired by Hidden Markov Models. The visual system is very simple and does not allow reliable recognition of speci c places but, used jointly with odometry, sonar recordings and an active perception system, it allows reliable localization even when the robot starts exploring its environment, and when it is passively translated from one place to another. Advantages and drawbacks of the current system are discussed, together with means to remediate the latter.

Regularizing AdaBoost Boosting methods maximize a hard classification margin and are known as powerful techniques that do not exhibit overfitting for low noise cases. Also for noisy data boosting will try to enforce a hard margin and thereby give too much weight to outliers, which then leads to the dilemma of non-smooth fits and overfitting. Therefore we propose three algorithms to allow for soft margin classification by introducing regularization with slack variables into the boosting concept: (1) AdaBoost reg and regularized versions of (2) linear and (3) quadratic programming AdaBoost. Experiments show the usefulness of the proposed algorithms in comparison to another soft margin classifier: the support vector machine.  1 Introduction  Boosting and other ensemble methods have been used with success in several applications, e. g.

Real-Time American Sign Language Recognition Using Desk and Wearable Computer Based Video Hidden Markov models (HMM's) have been used prominently and successfully in speech recognition and, more recently, in handwriting recognition. Consequently, they seem ideal for visual recognition of complex, structured hand gestures such as are found in sign language.

The first experiment tracks hands wearing colored gloves and attains a word accuracy of 99%. The second experiment tracks hands without gloves and attains a word accuracy of 92%. Both experiments have a 40 word lexicon.  1 Introduction  While there are many different types of gestures, the most structured sets belong to the sign languages. In sign language, each gesture already has assigned meaning, and strong rules of context and grammar may be applied to make recognition tractable.

Supporting Cross-Cultural Communication with a Large-Screen System As opportunities for international collaboration and crosscultural communication among people from heterogeneous cultures increase, the importance of electronic communication support is increasing. To support cross-cultural communication, we believe it is necessary to offer environments in which participants enjoy conversations, which allow them to share one another¬ís background and profile visually. We believe that the following three functions are important: (1) showing topics based on participants¬í profiles and cultural background; (2) life-sized, large-screen interface; and, (3) displaying objects which show feelings of identify. In this paper, we discuss the implementation and the empirical evaluation of two systems that were designed to support cross-cultural communication in the real world or between remote locations. From the empirical evaluation of these systems, we conclude that these systems add new functionality to support conversation contents, which may be especially useful in a cross-cultural context where language skills are an issue, and this type of environment may be especially useful in a pre-collaboration context.

Structure and Performance of Decision Support Algorithms on Active Disks Growth and usage trends for large decision support databases indicate that there is a need for architectures that scale the processing power as the dataset grows. These trends indicate that the processing demand for large decision support databases is growing faster than the improvement in performance of commodity processors. To meet this need, several researchers have recently proposed Active Disk/IDISK architectures which integrate substantial processing power and memory into disk units. In this paper, we examine the utility of Active Disks for decision support databases. We try to answer the following questions. First, is it possible to restructure algorithms for common decision support tasks to utilize Active Disks? Second, how does the performance of Active Disks compare with that of traditional servers for these tasks? Finally, how would Active Disks be integrated into the software architecture of decision support databases? 1 Introduction  Growth and usage trends for large decis...

Document Clustering using Word Clusters via the Information Bottleneck Method We present a novel implementation of the recently introduced information bottleneck method for unsupervised document clustering. Given a joint empirical distribution of words and documents, p(x; y), we first cluster the words, Y , so that the obtained word clusters, Y_hat , maximally preserve the information on the documents. The resulting joint distribution, p(X; Y_hat ), contains most of the original information about the documents, I(X; Y_hat ) ~= I(X;Y ), but it is much less sparse and noisy. Using the same procedure we then cluster the documents, X , so that the information about the word-clusters is preserved. Thus, we first find word-clusters that capture most of the mutual information about the set of documents, and then find document clusters, that preserve the information about the word clusters. We tested this procedure over several document collections based on subsets taken from the standard 20Newsgroups corpus. The results were assessed by calculating the correlation between the document clusters and the correct labels for these documents. Finding from our experiments show that this double clustering procedure, which uses the information bottleneck method, yields significantly superior performance compared to other common document distributional clustering algorithms. Moreover, the double clustering procedure improves all the distributional clustering methods examined here.

An Ejection Chain Approach for the Generalized Assignment Problem this paper, we propose an ejection chain approach under the framework of tabu search (TS) for the generalized assignment problem (GAP), which is known to be NP-hard (Sahni and Gonzalez 1976). GAP seeks a minimum cost assignment of n jobs to m agents subject to a resource constraint for each agent. Among various heuristic algorithms developed for GAP are: a combination of the greedy method and local search by Martello and Toth (1981, 1990); a tabu search and simulated annealing approach by Osman (1995); a genetic algorithm by Chu and Beasley (1997); VDS methods by Amini and Racer (1995) and Racer and Amini (1994); a tabu search approach by Laguna et al. (1995) (which is proposed for a generalization of GAP); a set partitioning heuristic by Cattrysse et al. (1994); a relaxation heuristic by Lorena and Narciso (1996); a GRASP and MAX-MIN ant system combined with local search and tabu search by Lourenco and Serra (1998); a linear relaxation heuristic by Trick (1992); and so on. Many exact algorithms have also been proposed (e.g., Nauss 2003, Savelsbergh 1997). A simpler version of an ejection chain approach has also been proposed for the GAP in Laguna et al. (1995). Our ejection chain is based on the idea described in Glover (1997)

On Mapping Decision Trees and Neural Networks There exist several methods for transforming decision trees to neural networks. These methods typically construct the networks by directly mapping decision nodes or rules to the neural units. As a result, the networks constructed are often larger than necessary. This paper describes a pruning-based method for mapping decision trees to neural networks, which can compress the network by removing unimportant and redundant units and connections. In addition, equivalent decision trees extracted from the pruned networks are simpler than those induced by well-known algorithms such as ID3 and C4.5. Keywords: decision trees, neural networks, pruning. 1 Introduction Decision trees have been widely used for nonparametric pattern classification tasks which involve several pattern classes and a large number of features.

Web Document Classification based on Hyperlinks and Document Semantics . Besides the basic content, a web document also contains a set  of hyperlinks pointing to other related documents. Hyperlinks in a document  provide much information about its relation with other web documents.  By analyzing hyperlinks in documents, inter-relationship among  documents can be identified. In this paper, we will propose an algorithm  to classify web documents into subsets based on hyperlinks in documents  and their content.

Causal Models of Mobile Service Robot Behavior Temporal projection, the process of predicting what will happen when a robot executes its plan, is essential for autonomous service robots to successfully plan their missions. This paper describes a causal model of the behavior exhibited by the mobile robot Rhino  when running concurrent reactive plans for performing office delivery jobs. The model represents aspects of robot behavior that cannot be represented by most action models used in AI planning: it represents the temporal structure of continuous control processes, several modes of their interferences, and various kinds of uncertainty. This enhanced expressiveness enables xfrm  (McD92; BM94), a robot planning system, to predict, and therefore forestall, various kinds of behavior flaws including missed deadlines whilst exploiting incidental opportunities. The proposed causal model is experimentally validated using the robot and its simulator.  Introduction  Temporal projection, the process of predicting what will happen when a ro...

Boosting and Rocchio Applied to Text Filtering We discuss two learning algorithms for text filtering: modified Rocchio and a boosting algorithm called AdaBoost. We show how both algorithms can be adapted to maximize any general utility matrix that associates cost (or gain) for each pair of machine prediction and correct label. We first show that AdaBoost significantly outperforms another highly effective text filtering algorithm. We then compare AdaBoost and Rocchio over three large text filtering tasks. Overall both algorithms are comparable and are quite effective. AdaBoost produces better classifiers than Rocchio when the training collection contains a very large number of relevant documents. However, on these tasks, Rocchio runs much faster than AdaBoost. 1 Introduction  With the explosion in the amount of information available electronically, information filtering systems that automatically send articles of potential interest to a user are becoming increasingly important. If users indicate their interests to a filtering system...

To avoid a performance bottleneck, multiple copies of the server can be replicated and scattered across the network. Impact agents A set of data objects can be represented in a wide variety of ways. When building an application, we'd like to select a data structure that supports the application operations that are the most frequently executed, the most critical, or both.

Efficient Web Form Entry on PDAs We propose a design for displaying and manipulating HTML forms on small PDA screens. The form input widgets are not shown until the user is ready to fill them in. At that point, only one widget is shown at a time. The form is summarized on the screen by displaying just the text labels that prompt the user for each widget's information. The challenge of this design is to automatically find the match between each text label in a form, and the input widget for which it is the prompt. We developed eight algorithms for performing such label-widget matches. Some of the algorithms are based on n-gram comparisons, while others are based on common form layout conventions. We applied a combination of these algorithms to 100 simple HTML forms with an average of four input fields per form. These experiments achieved a 95% matching accuracy. We developed a scheme that combines all algorithms into a matching system. This system did well even on complex forms, achieving 80% accuracy in our experiments involving 330 input fields spread over 48 complex forms.

Constructing, Organizing, and Visualizing Collections of Topically Related Web Resources For many purposes, the Web page is too small a unit of interaction and analysis. Web sites are structured multimedia documents consisting of many pages, and users often are interested in obtaining and evaluating entire collections of topically related sites. Once such a collection is obtained, users face the challenge of exploring, comprehending, and organizing the items. We report four innovations that address these user needs. ‚Ä¢ We replaced the web page with the web site as the basic unit of interaction and analysis. ‚Ä¢ We defined a new information structure, the clan graph, that groups together sets of related sites. ‚Ä¢ We augment the representation of a site with a site profile, information about site structure and content that helps inform user evaluation of a site. ‚Ä¢ We invented a new graph visualization, the auditorium visualization, that reveals important structural and content properties of sites within a clan graph. Detailed analysis and user studies document the utility of this approach. The clan graph construction algorithm tends to filter out irrelevant sites and discover additional relevant items. The auditorium visualization, augmented with drill down capabilities to explore site profile data, helps users to find high-quality sites as well as sites that serve a particular function.

Finding Counterexamples to Inductive Conjectures We present an implementation of a method for ¬£nding counterexamples to universally quanti¬£ed inductive conjectures in ¬£rst-order logic. Our method uses the proof by consistency strategy to guide a search for a counterexample and a standard ¬£rst-order theorem prover to perform a concurrent check for inconsistency. We explain brie¬§y the theory behind the method, describe our implementation, and evaluate results achieved on a variety of incorrect conjectures from various sources. Some work in progress is also presented: we are applying the method to the veri¬£cation of cryptographic security protocols. In this context, a counterexample to a security property can indicate an attack on the protocol, and our method extracts the trace of messages exchanged in order to effect the attack. This application demonstrates the advantages of the method, in that quite complex side conditions decide whether a particular sequence of messages is possible. Using a theorem prover provides a natural way of dealing with this. Some early results are presented and we discuss future work. 1

A Machine Learning Researcher's Foray into Recidivism Prediction We discuss an application of machine learning to recidivism prediction. Our initial results motivate the  need for a methodology for technique selection for applications that involve unequal but unknown error  costs, a skewed data set, or both. Evaluation methodologies traditionally used in machine learning are  inadequate for analyzing performance in these situations, although they arise frequently when addressing  real-world problems. After discussing the problem of recidivism prediction and the particulars of our  data set, we present experimental results that motivate the need to evaluate learning algorithm over a  range of error costs. We then describe Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis, which has been  used extensively in signal detection theory for decades but has only recently begun to filter into machine  learning research. With this new perspective, we revisit the recidivism prediction task and present results  that contradict those obtained using a traditional ...

Induction of decision trees using RELIEFF In the context of machine learning from examples this paper deals with the problem of estimating the quality of attributes with and without dependencies between them. Greedy search prevents current inductive machine learning algorithms to detect significant dependencies between the attributes. Recently, Kira and Rendell developed the RELIEF algorithm for estimating the quality of attributes that is able to detect dependencies between attributes. We show strong relation between RELIEF's estimates and impurity functions, that are usually used for heuristic guidance of inductive learning algorithms. We propose to use RELIEFF, an extended version of RELIEF, instead of myopic impurity functions. We have reimplemented Assistant, a system for top down induction of decision trees, using RELIEFF as an estimator of attributes at each selection step. The algorithm is tested on several artificial and several real world problems. Results show the advantage of the presented approach to inductive lea...

Situated Computing: A Paradigm to Enhance the Mobile User's Interaction When people interact with computers, they have to pay attention for things that are not related to the situation of the problems because the interfaces are not contextualized to their working environment. Hence it is sometimes hard to integrate computers as embedded tools, which facilitate users to accomplish their objectives easily in the working life. Situated computing is a new paradigm for mobile computer users based on their physical context and activities carried out in the workspace. It defines the infrastructure how the situated interaction can be provided using applications. In this chapter we first describe a model called situation metaphor to design interaction between the user and mobile computers as the basis for the situated computing. Thereafter, a framework called Situated Information Filing and Filtering (SIFF) is presented as the foundation for situated application development. In general a three-stages schema is given considerting the top stage for situated applications. Four applications based on the SIFF are also presented to demonstrate the enhancement of mobile user's interaction that can be achieved.

SFS Based View Synthesis for Robust Face Recognition Sensitivity to variations in pose is a challenging problem in face recognition using appearance-based methods. More specifically, the appearance of a face changes dramatically when viewing and/or lighting directions change. Various approaches have been proposed to solve this difficult problem. They can be broadly divided into three classes: 1) multiple image based methods where multiple images of various poses per person are available, 2) hybrid methods where multiple example images are available during learning but only one database image per person is available during recognition, and 3) single image based methods where no example based learning is carried out. In this paper, we present a method that comes under class 3. This method based on shape-from-shading (SFS) improves the performance of a face recognition system in handling variations due to pose and illumination via image synthesis. 1 Introduction Face recognition has become one of the most active areas of research in image...

On Behavior Classification in Adversarial Environments In order for robotic systems to be successful in domains with other agents possibly interfering with the accomplishing of goals, the agents must be able to adapt to the opponents' behavior. The more quickly the agents can respond to a new situation, the better they will perform. We present an approach to doing adaptation which relies on classification of the current adversary into predefined adversary classes. For feature extraction, we present a windowing technique to abstract useful but not overly complicated features. In order to take into account the spatial locality of topological differences, we use a previously developed similarity metric. The feature extraction and classification steps are fully implemented in the domain of simulated robotic soccer, and experimental results are presented.

Automated State Abstraction for Options using the U-Tree Algorithm Learning a complex task can be significantly facilitated by defining a  hierarchy of subtasks. An agent can learn to choose between various  temporally abstract actions, each solving an assigned subtask, to accomplish  the overall task. In this paper, we study hierarchical learning using  the framework of options. We argue that to take full advantage of hierarchical  structure, one should perform option-specific state abstraction,  and that if this is to scale to larger tasks, state abstraction should be automated.  We adapt McCallum's U-Tree algorithm to automatically build  option-specific representations of the state feature space, and we illustrate  the resulting algorithm using a simple hierarchical task. Results  suggest that automated option-specific state abstraction is an attractive  approach to making hierarchical learning systems more effective.  1 Introduction  Researchers in the field of reinforcement learning have recently focused considerable attention on temporally abst...

Jotmail: A Voicemail Interface That Enables You to See What Was Said stevew/julia/urs @ research.att.com Voicemail is a pervasive, but under-researched tool for workplace communication. Despite potential advantages of voicemail over email, current phone-based voicemail UIs are highly problematic for users. We present a novel, Web-based, voicemail interface, Jotmail. The design was based on data from several studies of voicemail tasks and user strategies. The GUI has two main elements: (a) personal annotations that serve as a visual analogue to underlying speech; (b) automatically derived message header information. We evaluated Jotmail in an 8-week field trial, where people used it as their only means for accessing voicemail. Jotmail was successful in supporting most key voicemail tasks, although users ' electronic annotation and archiving behaviors were different from our initial predictions. Our results argue for the utility of a combination of annotation based indexing and automatically derived information, as a general technique for accessing speech archives.

Wasp Nests for Self-Configurable Factories Agent-based approaches to manufacturing scheduling and control have gained increasing attention in recent years. Such approaches are attractive because they offer increased robustness against the unpredictability of factory operations. But the specification of local coordination policies that give rise to efficient global performance and effectively adapt to changing circumstances remains an interesting challenge. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to this coordination problem, drawing on various aspects of a computational model of how wasp colonies coordinate individual activities and allocate tasks to meet the collective needs of the nest. We focus specifically on the problem of configuring machines in a factory to best satisfy (potentially changing) product demands over time. Our system models the set of jobs queued in front of any given machine as a wasp nest, wherein wasp-like agents interact to form a social hierarchy and prioritize the jobs that they represent.

Algebraic Topology for Knowledge Representation in Analogy Solving . We propose a computational model for analogy solving based on a topological formalism of representation. The source and the target analogs are represented as simplexes and the analogy solving is modeled as a topological deformation of these simplexes along a polygonal chain and according to some constraints. We apply this framework to the resolution of IQ-tests typically presented as "given A, B and C, find D such that A is to B what C is to D". 1 Introduction  In this paper, we present a topological framework for knowledge representation based on the concept of simplicial complex. We present then the ESQIMO system which is the application of this framework to an analogy solving problem. The underlying idea developed here is that spatial relationships and more precisely topological relationships such as neighbor, border, dimension, obstruction, deformation, separabitily, path, etc, enable the building and structuration of knowledge representation. More precisely, we explore the possi...

Imitation and Mechanisms of Joint Attention: A Developmental Structure for Building Social Skills on a Humanoid Robot Abstract. Adults are extremely adept at recognizing social cues, such as eye direction or pointing gestures, that establish the basis of joint attention. These skills serve as the developmental basis for more complex forms of metaphor and analogy by allowing an infant to ground shared experiences and by assisting in the development of more complex communication skills. In this chapter, we review some of the evidence for the developmental course of these joint attention skills from developmental psychology, from disorders of social development such as autism, and from the evolutionary development of these social skills. We also describe an on-going research program aimed at testing existing models of joint attention development by building a human-like robot which communicates naturally with humans using joint attention. Our group has constructed an upper-torso humanoid robot, called Cog, in part to investigate how to build intelligent robotic systems by following a developmental progression of skills similar to that observed in human development. Just as a child learns social skills and conventions through interactions with its parents, our robot will learn to interact with people using natural social communication. We further consider the critical role that imitation plays in bootstrapping a system from simple visual behaviors to more complex social skills. We will present data from a face and eye finding system that serves as the basis of this developmental chain, and an example of how this system can imitate the head movements of an individual. 1

Individual Action and Collective Function: from Sociology to Multi-Agent Learning > How do we characterize the process and the dynamics of co-learning, conceptually, mathematically, or computationally?   How do social structures and relations interact with co-learning of multiple agents?  1  And so on.  A key question, however, is as follows, which deserves some discussion here. Adam Smith (1976) put it this way:  He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much  he is promoting it..... He intends only his own gain, and he is led by an invisible hand to  promote an end which was not part of his intention.  This paradox have been troubling sociologists and economists for many decades, and now computer scientists and psychologists as well. The issue may be formulated as the apparent gap between the individual intention in deciding his/her own action and the (possibly largely unintended) social function of his/her action. For example, how may self-interested action benet social welfare? Or,

Learning to Extract Symbolic Knowledge from the World Wide Web The World Wide Web is a vast source of information accessible to computers, but understandable only to humans. The goal of the research described here is to automatically create a computer understandable knowledge base whose content mirrors that of the World Wide Web. Such a knowledge base would enable much more e ective retrieval of Web information, and promote new uses of the Web to support knowledge-based inference and problem solving. Our approach istodevelop a trainable information extraction system that takes two inputs. The rst is an ontology that de nes the classes (e.g., Company, Person, Employee, Product) and relations (e.g., Employed.By, Produced.By) ofinterest when creating the knowledge base. The second is a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext that represent instances of these classes and relations. Given these inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks on the Web. This paper describes our general approach, several machine learning algorithms for this task, and promising initial results with a prototype system that has created a knowledge base describing university people, courses, and research projects.

Using linear classifiers in the integration of user modeling and text content analysis in the personalization of a Web-based Spanish News Service Nowadays many newspapers and news agencies offer personalized  information access services and, moreover, there is a growing interest in the  improvement of these services. In this paper we present a methodology useful  to improve the intelligent personalization of news services and the way it has  been applied to a Spanish relevant newspaper: ABC. Our methodology  integrates textual content analysis tasks and machine learning techniques to  achieve an elaborated user model, which represents separately short-term needs  and long-term multi-topic interests. The characterization of a user's interests  includes his preferences about structure (newspaper sections), content and  information delivery. A wide coverage and non-specific-domain classification  of topics and a personal set of keywords allow the user to define his preferences  about content. Machine learning techniques are used to obtain an initial  representation of each category of the topic classification. Finally, we introduce  some details about the Mercurio system, which is being used to implement this  methodology for ABC. We describe our experience and an evaluation of the  system in comparison with other commercial systems.

He can further query a data source which provides information about car reviews to help his decision about the cars he liked.

User input is accomplished by  projecting an image of the interface onto a flat surface in the scene which is monitored with  a video camera. The scheme hinges on the observation that the relationship between the  three surfaces of interest, the work surface, the virtual keyboard and the image obtained by  the camera, can be characterized by projective transformations of RP  2  . This observation  leads to a fast and accurate online calibration algorithm.

Adaptable and Adaptive Information Provision for All Users, Including Disabled and Elderly People Due to the tremendously increasing popularity of the World-Wide Web, hypermedia is going to be the leading online information medium for some years to come and will most likely become the standard gateway for citizens to the "information highway". Already today, visitors of web sites are generally heterogeneous and have different needs, and this is likely to increase in the future. The aim of the AVANTI project is to cater hypermedia information to these individual needs by adapting the content and the presentation of web pages to each individual user. The special needs of elderly and disabled users are also partly considered. A model of the characteristics of user groups, individual users and usage environments, and a domain model are exploited in the adaptation process. One aim of this research is to verify that adaptation and user modeling techniques that were hitherto mostly used for catering interactive software systems to able-bodied users also prove useful for adaptation to users with special needs. Another original aspect is the development of a network-wide user modeling server that can concurrently accommodate the user modeling needs of several applications and several instances of an application within a distributed computing environment.

Efficient Concurrency Control for Broadcast Environments A crucial consideration in environments where data is broadcast to clients is the low bandwidth available for clients to communicate with servers. Advanced applications in such environments do need to read data that is mutually consistent aswell as current. However, given the asymmetric communication capabilities and the needs of clients in mobile environments, traditional serializability-based approaches are too restrictive, unnecessary, and impractical. We thus propose the use of a weaker correctness criterion called update consistency and outline mechanisms based on this criterion that ensure (1) the mutual consistency of data maintained by the server and read by clients, and (2) the currency of data read by clients. Using these mechanisms, clients can obtain data that is current and mutually consistent "off the air", i.e., without contacting the server to, say, obtain locks. Experimental results show a substantial reduction in response times as compared to existing (serializability-based) approaches. A further attractive feature of the approach is that if caching is possible at a client, weaker forms of currency can be obtained while still satisfying the mutual consistency of data.

Planning Agents in James Abstract ‚Äî Testing is an obligatory step in developing multi-agent systems. For testing multi-agent systems in virtual, dynamic environments, simulation systems are required that support a modular, declarative construction of experimental frames, that facilitate the embeddence of a variety of agent architectures, and that allow an efficient parallel, distributed execution. We introduce the system James (A Java-Based Agent Modeling Environment for Simulation). In James agents and their dynamic environment are modeled as reflective, time triggered state automata. Its possibilities to compose experimental frames based on predefined components, to express temporal interdependencies, to capture the phenomenon of pro-activeness and reflectivity of agents are illuminated by experiments with planning agents. The underlying planning system is a general purpose system, about which no empirical results exist besides traditional static benchmark tests. We analyze the interplay between heuristics for selecting goals, viewing range, commitment strategies, explorativeness, and trust in the persistence of the world and uncover properties of the agent, the planning engine and the chosen test scenario: Tileworld.

The Repair of Speech Act Misunderstandings by Abductive Inference this paper, we have concentrated on the repair of mis-understanding. Our colleagues Heeman and Edmonds have looked at the repair of non-understanding. The difference between the two situations is that in the former, the agent derives exactly one interpretation of an utterance and hence is initially unaware of any problem; in the latter, the agent derives either more than one interpretation, with no way to choose between them, or no interpretation at all, and so the problem is immediately apparent. Heeman and Edmonds looked in particular at cases in which a referring expression uttered by one conversant was not understood by the other (Heeman and Hirst 1995; Edmonds 1994; Hirst et. al. 1994). Clark and his colleagues (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986; Clark 1993) have shown that in such situations, conversants will collaborate on repairing the problem by, in effect, negotiating a reconstruction or elaboration of the referring expression. Heeman and Edmonds model this with a plan recognition and generation system that can recognize faulty plans and try to repair them. Thus (as in our own model) two copies of the system can converse with each other, negotiating referents of referring expressions that are not understood by trying to recognize the referring plans of the other, repairing them where necessary, and presenting the new referring plan to the other for approval.

SENTINEL: A Multiple Engine Information Retrieval and Visualization System We describe a prototype Information Retrieval system, SENTINEL, under development at Harris Corporation's Information Systems Division. SENTINEL is a fusion of multiple information retrieval technologies, integrating n-grams, a vector space model, and a neural network training rule. One of the primary advantages of SENTINEL is its 3-dimenstional visualization capability that is based fully upon the mathematical representation of information within SENTINEL. This 3-dimensional visualization capability provides users with an intuitive understanding, with relevance feedback/query refinement techniques that can be better utilized, resulting in higher retrieval accuracy (precision).

Foreign Event Handlers to Maintain Information Consistency and System Adequacy this paper is to describe novel applications of Mobile Code technology which have not appeared yet but should be feasible with our current knowledge of the domain. These new applications contradict the often-made observation that Mobile Code is just another technique that does not really bring much more possibilities than existing technologies for distributed applications. There is a whole class of problems that have not received much attention yet and that are not well managed by current environments. These are the problems of maintaining consistency of dynamic information and maintaining systems in adequacy with the ever changing requirements of customers. Our motivation is that, besides the quantitative improvements that most people expect from using Mobile Code, there is also a qualitative benefit which is even more important but not universally recognized now: Mobile Code allows communication with less conventions than message passing [5, 3]. Processes interconnected by Mobile Code still have to agree on high level encoding and synchronization primitives but these agreements are only a fraction of what is necessary to communicate. Many context dependent aspects can be encapsulated inside Mobile Code and changed when the context changes. Encapsulation has the same benefits here as in other software engineering domains: it reduces the dependency between components, thus reducing the number of modifications that we must make to software in order to adapt it to new requirements. For this reason we think that it is the best way to cope with systems that are distributed, hence not manageable by a single person or organization; that are dynamic, because the information they contain must change when the world itself changes; and that are evolving since the users discover n...

Introducing Trusted Third Parties to the Mobile Agent Paradigm Abstract. The mobile agent paradigm gains ever more acceptance for the creation of distributed applications, particularly in the domain of electronic commerce. In such applications, a mobile agent roams the global Internet in search of services for its owner. One of the problems with this approach is that malicious service providers on the agent's itinerary can access con dential information contained in the agent or tamper with the agent. In this article we identify trust as a major issue in this context and propose a pessimistic approach to trust that tries to prevent malicious behaviour rather than correcting it. The approach relies on a trusted and tamper-resistant hardware device that provides the mobile agent with the means to protect itself. Finally, weshow that the approach is not limited to protecting the mobile agents of a user but can also be extended to protect the mobile agents of a trusted third party inorder to take fulladvantage of the mobile agent paradigm. 1

A Competitive Layer Model for Feature Binding and Sensory Segmentation We present a recurrent neural network for feature binding and sensory segmentation,  the competitive layer model (CLM). The CLM uses topographically structured  competitive and cooperative interactions in a layered network to partition a set of input  features into salient groups. The dynamics is formulated within a standard additive recurrent  network with linear threshold neurons. Contextual relations among features are  coded by pairwise compatibilities which define an energy function to be minimized by  the neural dynamics. Due to the usage of dynamical winner-take-all circuits the model  gains more flexible response properties than spin models of segmentation by exploiting  amplitude information in the grouping process. We prove analytic results on the convergence  and stable attractors of the CLM, which generalize earlier results on winner-take-all networks, and incorporate deterministic annealing for robustness against local  minima. The piecewise linear dynamics of the CLM allows a linear eigensubspace  analysis which we use to analyze the dynamics of binding in conjunction with annealing.  For the example of contour detection we show how the CLM can integrate  figure-ground segmentation and grouping into a unified model.

Multiagent Systems Specification by UML Statecharts Aiming at Intelligent Manufacturing Multiagent systems are a promising new paradigm in computing,  which are contributing to various fields. Many theories and technologies  have been developed in order to design and specify multiagent systems,  however, no standard procedure is used at present. Industrial applications  often have a complex structure and need plenty of working  resources. They require a standard specification method as well. As the  standard method to design and specify software systems, we believe that  one of the key words is simplicity for their wide acceptance. In this paper,  we propose a method to specify multiagent systems, namely with UML  statecharts.

A Performance Evaluation of Alternative Mapping Schemes for Storing XML Data in a Relational Database XML is emerging as one of the dominant data formats for data processing on the Internet. To query  XML data, query languages likeXQL, Lorel, XML-QL, or XML-GL have been proposed. In this paper,  we study how XML data can be stored and queried using a standard relational database system. For this  purpose, we present alternative mapping schemes to store XML data in a relational database and discuss  how XML-QL queries can be translated into SQL queries for every mapping scheme. We present the  results of comprehensive performance experiments that analyze the tradeo#s of the alternative mapping  schemes in terms of database size, query performance and update performance. While our discussion  is focussed on XML and XML-QL, the results of this paper are relevant for most semi-structured data  models and most query languages for semi-structured data.  1 Introduction  It has become clear that not all applications are met by the relational, object-relational, or object-oriented data models. ...

Text-Based Content Search and Retrieval in ad hoc P2P Communities We consider the problem of content search and retrieval in peer-to-peer (P2P) communities. P2P computing is a potentially powerful model for information sharing between ad hoc groups' of users because of its' low cost of entry and natural model for resource scaling with community size. As P2P communities grow in size, however, locating information distributed across the large number of peers becomes problematic. We present a distributed text-based content search and retrieval algorithm to address this' problem. Our algorithm is' based on a state-of-the-art text-based document ranking algorithm: the vector-space model instantiated with the TFxlDF ranking rule. A naive application of TFxlDF wouM require each peer in a community to collect an inverted index of the entire community. This' is' costly both in terms of bandwidth and storage. Instea & we show how TFxlDF can be approximated given compact summaries of peers' local inverted indexes. We make three contributions: (a) we show how the TFxlDF rule can be adapted to use the index summaries, (b) we provide a heuristic for adaptively determining the set of peers that shouM be contacted for a query, and (c) we show that our algorithm tracks' TFxlDF's performance very closely, regardless of how documents' are distributed throughout the community. Furthermore, our algorithm preserves the main flavor of TFxlDF by retrieving close to the same set of documents for any given query.

Improving Data Driven Wordclass Tagging by System Combination In this paper we examine how the differences in modelling between different data driven systems performing the same NLP task can be exploited to yield a higher accuracy than the best individual system. We do this by means of an experiment involving the task of morpho-syntactic wordclass tagging. Four well-known tagger generators (Hidden Markov Model, Memory-Based, Transformation Rules and Maximum Entropy) are trained on the same corpus data. After comparison, their outputs are combined using several voting strategies and second stage classifiers. All combination taggers outperform their best component, with the best combination showing a 19.1% lower error rate than the best individual tagger.

Saccadic Search with Gabor features applied to Eye Detection and Real-Time Head Tracking The Gabor decomposition is a ubiquitous tool in computer vision. Nevertheless, it is generally considered computationally demanding for active vision applications. We suggest an attention-driven approach to feature detection inspired by the human saccadic system. A dramatic speedup is achieved by computing the Gabor decomposition only on the points of a sparse retinotopic grid. An off-line eye detection application and a real-time head localisation and tracking system are presented. The real-time system features a novel eyeball-mounted camera designed to simulate the dynamic performance of the human eye and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of active vision system based on the Gabor decomposition.

Information extraction (IE) is a form of shallow  text understanding that locates specific pieces of data  in natural language documents, transforming unstructured  text into a structured database. This paper describes a system  called DISCOTEX, that combines IE and data mining  methodologies to perform text mining as well as improve  the performance of the underlying extraction system. Rules  mined from a database extracted from a corpus of texts are  used to predict additional information to extract from future  documents, thereby improving the recall of IE. Encouraging  results are presented on applying these techniques to a corpus  of computer job announcement postings from an Internet  newsgroup.

How Many Separately Evolved Emotional Beasties Live Within Us? A problem which bedevils the study of emotions, and the study of consciousness, is that we assume a shared understanding of many everyday concepts, such as `emotion', `feeling', `pleasure', `pain', `desire', `awareness', etc. Unfortunately, these concepts are inherently very complex, ill-defined, and used with different meanings by different people. Moreover this goes unnoticed, so that people think they understand what they are referring to even when their understanding is very unclear. Consequently there is much discussion that is inherently vague, often at cross-purposes, and with apparent disagreements that arise out of people unwittingly talking about different things. We need a framework which explains how there can be all the diverse phenomena that different people refer to when they talk about emotions and other affective states and processes. The conjecture on which this paper is based is that adult humans have a type of information-processing architecture, with components whi...

Summarizing Text Documents: Sentence Selection and Evaluation Metrics Human-quality text summarization systems are difficult to design, and even more difficult to evaluate, in part because documents can differ along several dimensions, such as length, writing style and lexical usage. Nevertheless, certain cues can often help suggest the selection of sentences for inclusion in a summary. This paper presents our analysis of news-article summaries generated by sentence selection. Sentences are ranked for potential inclusion in the summary using a weighted combination of statistical and linguistic features. The statistical features were adapted from standard IR methods. The potential linguistic ones were derived from an analysis of news-wire summaries. Toevaluate these features we use a normalized version of precision-recall curves, with a baseline of random sentence selection, as well as analyze the properties of such a baseline. We illustrate our discussions with empirical results showing the importance of corpus-dependent baseline summarization standards, compression ratios and carefully crafted long queries.

Maintaining Temporal Views Over Non-Temporal Information Sources For Data Warehousing An important use of data warehousing is to provide temporal views over the history of source  data that may itself be non-temporal. While recent work in view maintenance is applicable to  data warehousing, only non-temporal views have been considered. In this paper, we introduce  a framework for maintaining temporal views over non-temporal information sources in a data  warehousing environment. We describe an architecture for the temporal data warehouse that  automatically maintains temporal views over non-temporal source relations, and allows users  to ask temporal queries using these views. Because of the dimension of time, a materialized  temporal view may need to be updated not only when source relations change, but also as time  advances. We present incremental techniques to maintain temporal views for both cases, and  outline the implementation of our approach in the WHIPS warehousing prototype at Stanford.  1 Introduction  A data warehouse is a repository for efficient querying ...

Active Markov Localization for Mobile Robots Localization is the problem of determining the position of a mobile robot from sensor data. Most existing localization approaches are passive, i.e., they do not exploit the opportunity to control the robot's effectors during localization. This paper proposes an active localization approach. The approach is based on Markov localization and provides rational criteria for (1) setting the robot's motion direction (exploration), and (2) determining the pointing direction of the sensors so as to most efficiently localize the robot. Furthermore, it is able to deal with noisy sensors and approximative world models. The appropriateness of our approach is demonstrated empirically using a mobile robot in a structured office environment.

It practice, large non-linear systems have to be solved, most of the time using an iterative optimization process starting from a sub-optimal solution obtained by using linear methods. The behaviour, in terms of convergence, and the computational cost of this process depend on the parameterization used to represent the problem, i.e. of structure and motion.

Non-Supervised Sensory-Motor Agents Learning This text discusses a proposal for creation and destruction of neurons based on the sensory-motor activity. This model, called sensory-motor schema, is used to define a sensory-motor agent as a collection of activity schemata. The activity schema permits a useful distribution of neurons in a conceptual space, creating concepts based on action and sensation. Such approach is inspired in the theory of the Swiss psychologist and epistemologist Jean Piaget, and intends to make explicit the account of the processes of continuous interaction between sensory-motor agents and their environments when agents are producing cognitive structures. 1.

Simultaneous Proxy Evaluation The Simultaneous Proxy Evaluation (SPE) architecture is designed to evaluate multiple web proxies in parallel using object requests which are duplicated and passed to each proxy. The SPE architecture reduces problems of unrealistic test environments, dated and/or inappropriate workloads, and is additionally applicable to contentbased prefetching proxies. It is intended to measure byte and object hit rates, client-perceived latencies, and cache consistency. We characterize a space of proxy evaluation methodologies and place this architecture within it. 1 Introduction This paper presents a new architecture for the evaluation of proxy caches.

In particular, we found that existing mechanisms for the evaluation of proxy caches were not well suited to prefetching systems.

POWERVIEW - Using information links and information views to navigate and visualize information on small displays . PowerView is a PDA application designed to support people with  situational information, primarily during conversations and meetings with other  people.

In terms of information visualization, the system was required to  provide the user with a single integrated information system that enabled quick  access to related information once an object of interest had been selected. In  terms of interaction, the system was required to enable easy and efficient  information retrieval, including single-handed use of the device.

Learning Markov Processes this article, we restrict our attention to discrete time dynamical systems.) Typically we do not know the exact dynamics of the system, so instead we consider a probabilistic state transition function: P (X t+1 jX t ). Such a probabilistic formulation will be particularly useful when we try to learn the model from data. The state space,  might be discrete (nite) or continuous (innite). For example, we might just try to predict the probability that a stock goes up or down, in which case  = f"; #g; more ambitiously, we might try to predict its expected value, in which case  = IR. In general, the state is a vector of state variables, which we can partition into three kinds: input variables (ones which we can control), output variables (ones which we can observe), and hidden or latent variables (internal variables which we cannot directly control or observe); we shall denote these by U t , Y t and X t  respectively. See Figure 1. In this article, we shall consider how to learn models of this kind.

Exploiting Versions for Handling Updates in Broadcast Disks Recently, broadcasting has attracted considerable attention as a means of disseminating information to large client populations in both wired and wireless settings. In this paper, we exploit versions to increase the concurrency of client transactions in the presence of updates. We consider three alternative mediums for storing versions: (a) the air: older versions are broadcast along with current data, (b) the client's local cache: older versions are maintained in cache, and (c) a local database or warehouse at the client: part of the server's database is maintained at the client in the form of a multiversion materialized view. The proposed techniques are scalable in that they provide consistency without any direct communication from clients to the server. Performance results show that the overhead of maintaining versions can be kept low, while providing a considerable increase in concurrency.   1 Introduction  While traditionally data are delivered from servers to clients on demand, a...

Knowledge-based Wrapper Generation by Using XML Information extraction is the process of recognizing  the particular fragments of a document that constitute  its core semantic content. However, most  previous information extraction systems were not  effective for real-world information sources due to  difficulties in acquiring and representing useful domain  knowledge and in dealing with structural heterogeneity  inherent in different sources.  In order to resolve these problems, this paper  proposes a scheme of knowledge-based wrapper  generation for semi-structured and labeled documents.  The implementation of an agent-oriented information  extraction system, XTROS, is described.  In contrast with previous wrapper learning agents,  XTROS represents both the domain knowledge and  the wrappers by XML documents to increase modularity,  flexibility, and interoperability among multiple  parties. XTROS also facilitates simpler implementation  of the wrapper generator by exploiting  XML parsers and interpreters. XTROS shows  good performance on several Web sites in the domain  of real estates, and it is expected to be easily  adaptable to different domains by plugging in appropriate  XML-based domain knowledge.  1

The Persistent Cache: Improving OID Indexing in Temporal Object-Oriented Database Systems In a temporal OODB, an OID index (OIDX) is needed to map from OID to the physical location of the object. In a transaction time temporal OODB, the OIDX should also index the object versions. In this case, the index entries, which we call object descriptors (OD), also include the commit timestamp of the transaction that created the object version. The OIDX in a non-temporal OODB only needs to be updated when an object is created, but in a temporal OODB, the OIDX have to be updated every time an object is updated. We have in a previous study shown that this can be a potential bottleneck, and in this report, we present the Persistent Cache (PCache), a novel approach which reduces the index update and lookup costs in temporal OODBs. In this report, we develop a cost model for the PCache, and use this to show that the use of a PCache can reduce the average access cost to only a fraction of the cost when not using the PCache.

Reaching for Objects in VR Displays: Lag and Frame Rate This article reports the results from three experimental studies of reaching behavior in a head-coupled stereo display system with a hand-tracking subsystem for object selection. It is found that lag in the head-tracking system is relatively unimportant in predicting performance, whereas lag in the hand-tracking system is critical. The effect of hand lag can be modeled by means of a variation on Fitts ‚Äô Law with the measured system lag introduced as a multiplicative variable to the Fitts ‚Äô Law index of difilculty. This means that relatively small lags can cause considerable degradation in performance if the targets are small. Another finding is that errors are higher for movement in and out of the screen, as compared to movements in the plane of the screen, and there is a small (10‚Äô%) time penalty for movement in the Z direction in all three experiments. Low frame rates cause a degradation in performance; however, this can be attributed to the lag which is caused by low frame rates, particularly if double buffering is used combined with early sampling of the hand-tracking device.

Scalability In Formal Concept Analysis This paper presents the results of experiments carried out with a set of 4,000 medical discharge summaries in which were recognised 1,962 attributes from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). In this domain, the objects are medical documents (4,000) and the attributes are UMLS terms extracted from the documents (1,962). When Formal Concept Analysis is used to iteratively analyse and visualize this data, complexity and scalability become critically important. Although the amount of data used in this experiment is small compared with the size of primary memory in modern computers, the results are still important since the probability distributions which determine the efficiencies are likely to remain stable as the size of the data is increased. Our work presents two outcomes, firstly we present a methodology for exploring knowledge in text documents using Formal Concept Analysis by employing conceptual scales created as the result of direct manipulation of a line diagram. The conceptual scales lead to small derived purified contexts that are represented using nested line diagrams. Secondly, we present an algorithm for the fast determination of purified contexts from a compressed representation of the large formal context. Our work draws on existing encoding and compression techniques to show how rudimentary data analysis can lead to substantial efficiency improvements to knowledge visualisation. c fl 1993 Blackwell Publishers, 238 Main Street, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA, and 108 Cowley Road, Oxford, OX4 1JF, UK.

As the size of the data grows, it becomes more difficult to maintain the copy "fresh," making it crucial to synchronize the copy effectively. We define two freshness metrics, change models of the underlying data, and synchronization policies. We analytically study how effective the various policies are. We also experimentally verify our analysis, based on data collected from 270 web sites for more than 4 months, and we show that our new policy improves the "freshness" very significantly compared to current policies in use.

Agents support a dynamic distribution of control and management functions across networks, thus increasing flexibility and efficiency. We propose to use mobile-agent technology to overcome some of the problems inherent in current Internet technology. We focus our attention to QoS monitoring, being locally significant in network subdomains, and realize a QoS management strategy in response to variations of user, customer of application requirements, and of the network state. We describe our experience and the results obtained from our testbed, where software agents are instantiated, executed, migrated, and suspended in order to implement flexible QoS management in IP networks.

A Knowledge-Based Approach for Designing Intelligent Team Training Systems This paper presents a knowledge approach to designing team training systems using intelligent agents. We envision a computer-based training system in which teams are trained by putting them through scenarios, which allow them to practice their team skills. There are two important roles that intelligent agents can play; these are virtual team members, and tutors. To carry out these functions, these agents must be equipped with an understanding of the task domain, the team structure, the selected decision-making process and their beliefs about other team members' mental states. Even though existing agent teamwork models incorporate many of the elements listed above, they have not focused on analyzing information needs of team members to support proactive agent interactions. To encode the team knowledge, we have developed a representation language, based on the BDI model, called MALLET.

Improving Interaction with Virtual Environments Introduction  Virtual environments (VEs) provide a computer-based interface to a real-life or abstract space, using 3D graphics and 3D interaction techniques. VEs represent a novel interface style which offers new possibilities and challenges to human-computer interface design. However, studies of the design of VEs (Kaur et al., 1996) show that designers lack a coherent approach to design, especially interaction design. Designers appear to be pre-occupied with difficult technical issues and think little about supporting user interaction. However, major interaction problems have been found with current VEs, such as disorientation, perceptual misjudgements and difficulty finding and understanding available interactions (McGovern, 1993; COVEN, 1997). These common problems have been known to result in user frustration and a low usability and acceptability for the VE (Kaur et al., 1996; Miller 1994). Guidance is needed on interaction design for VEs to avoid such usability problems.

The paper presents some ideas regarding weighting of multiple agents and extends them into partitioning an input/state space into multiple regions with differential weighting in these regions, to exploit differential characteristics of regions and differential characteristics of agents to reduce the learning complexity of agents (and their function approximators) and thus to facilitate the learning overall. It analyzes, in reinforcement learning tasks, different ways of partitioning a task and using agents selectively based on partitioning. Based on the analysis, some heuristic methods are described and experimentally tested. We find that some off-line heuristic methods performed the best, significantly better than single-agent models.

Two major tasks in MRF modeling are how to define the neighborhood system for irregular sites and how to choose the energy function for a proper encoding of constraints. The proposed energy function offers two major advantages that makes it possible to avoid MRF modeling problems in the case of irregular sites. First, full connectivity makes the neighborhood definition irrelevant, and second, the energy function is defined independently of the considered application. A basic assumption in SGT is the infinite dimension of the configuration space in which the energy is defined; the choice of a particular energy function, which depends on the scalar product between configurations, allows us to use a kernel function in the energy formulation; this solves the problem of high dimensionality and makes it possible to use SGT results in an MRF framework. We call this new model Spin Glass- - Markov Random Field (SG-MRF). Experiments on textures and objects database show the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed model

HICAP: An Interactive Case-Based Planning Architecture and its Application to Noncombatant Evacuation Operations This paper describes HICAP (Hierarchical Interactive Case-based Architecture for Planning), a general purpose planning architecture that we have developed and applied to assist military commanders and their staff with planning NEOs (Noncombatant Evacuation Operations). HICAP integrates a hierarchical task editor, HTE, with a conversational case-based planning tool, NaCoDAE/HTN. In this application, HTE maintains an agenda of tactical planning tasks that, according to the guidelines indicated by military doctrine, must be addressed in a NEO plan. It also supports several bookkeeping tasks, which are crucial for large-scale planning tasks that differ greatly among different NEO operations. Military planning personnel select a task to decompose from HTE and then use NaCoDAE/HTN to interactively refine it into an operational plan by selecting and applying cases, which represent task decompositions from previous NEO operations. Thus, HICAP helps commanders by using previous experience to fo...

Learning to Construct Knowledge Bases from the World Wide Web The World Wide Web is a vast source of information accessible to computers, but understandable only to humans. The goal of the research described here is to automatically create a computer understandable knowledge base whose content mirrors that of the World Wide Web. Such a knowledge base would enable much more effective retrieval of Web information, and promote new uses of the Web to support knowledge-based inference and problem solving. Our approach is to develop a trainable information extraction system that takes two inputs. The first is an ontology that defines the classes (e.g., company, person, employee, product) andrelations (e.g., employed by, produced by) of interest when creating the knowledge base. The second is a set of training data consisting of labeled regions of hypertext that represent instances of these classes and relations. Given these inputs, the system learns to extract information from other pages and hyperlinks on the Web. This article describes our general approach, several machine learning algorithms for this task, and promising initial results with a prototype system that has created a knowledge base describing university people, courses, and research projects.

Graded Learning for Object Detection Our goal is to detect all instances of a generic object class, such as a face, in greyscale scenes. The design of the algorithm is motivated by computational efficiency. The search is coarse-to-fine in both the exploration of poses and the representation of the object class. Starting from training examples, we recursively learn a hierarchy of spatial arrangements of edge fragments, graded by their size (sparsity). The arrangements have no a priori semantic or geometric interpretation. Instead, they are selected to be "decomposable": Each can be split into two correlated subarrangements, each of which can be further divided, etc. As a result, the probability of an arrangement of size k appearing on an object instance decays slowly with k. We demonstrate this both theoretically and in experiments in which detection means finding a sufficient number of arrangements of various sizes. 1 Introduction  Starting with a training set of examples of a generic object class (e.g., "face"), our goal...

Dynamic Update Cube for Range-Sum Queries A range-sum query is very popular and becomes  important in finding trends and in discovering  relationships between attributes in diverse  database applications. It sums over the selected  cells of an OLAP data cube where target cells are  decided by the specified query ranges. The direct  method to access the data cube itself forces too  many cells to be accessed, therefore it incurs a  severe overhead. The response time is very  crucial for OLAP applications which need  interactions with users. In the recent dynamic  enterprise environment, data elements in the  cube are frequently changed. The response time  is affected in such an environment by the update  cost as well as the search cost of the cube.  In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm  to reduce the update cost significantly while  maintaining reasonable search efficiency, by  using an index structure called the -tree. In  addition, we propose a hybrid method to provide  either an approximate result or a precise one to  reduce the overall cost of queries. It is useful for  various applications that need a quick approximate  answer rather than an accurate one, such as  decision support systems.  1.

Concepts and Architecture of a Security-Centric Mobile Agent Server Mobile software agents are software components that are able to move in a network. They are often considered as an attractive technology in electronic commerce applications. Although security concerns prevail. In this paper we describe the architecture and concepts of the SeMoA server -- a runtime environment for Java-based mobile agents. Its architecture has a focus on security and easy extendability, and offers a framework for transparent content inspection of agents by means of filters. We implemented filters that handle agent signing and authentication as well as selective encryption of agent contents. Filters are applied transparently such that agents need not be aware of the security services provided by the server.

Algorithms for Optimizing Leveled Commitment Contracts In automated negotiation systems consisting of self-interested agents, contracts have traditionally been binding. Leveled commitment contracts‚Äîi.e. contracts where each party can decommit by paying a predetermined penalty were recently shown to improve Pareto efficiency even if agents rationally decommit in Nash equilibrium using inflated thresholds on how good their outside offers must be before they decommit. This paper operationalizes the four leveled commitment contracting protocols by presenting algorithms for using them. Algorithms are presented for computing the Nash equilibrium decommitting thresholds and decommitting probabilities given the contract price and the penalties. Existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium are analyzed. Algorithms are also presented for optimizing the contract itself (price and penalties). Existence and uniqueness of the optimum are analyzed. Using the algorithms we offer a contract optimization service on the web as part of ('Mediator, our next generation electronic commerce server. Finally, the algorithms are generalized to contracts involving more than two agents. 1

Query Processing in Relationlog . Relationlog is a persistent deductive database system that  supports eective storage, ecient access and inference of large amounts  of data with complex structures. In this paper, we describe query processing  in the Relationlog system. In particular, we illustrate the extended  semi-naive and magic-set techniques used in Relationlog.  1 Introduction  During the past decades, the nested relational and complex object models [1, 5, 11, 12, 15, 18, 21, 22] were developed to extend the applicability of the traditional relational model to more complex, non-business applications such as CAD, image processing and text retrieval [2].  Another important direction of intense research has been in using a logic programming based language Datalog [8, 23] as a database query language. Such a language provides a simple and natural way to express queries on a relational database and is more expressive than the traditional relational languages.  In the past several years, there have been some eorts...

On splitting and Cloning Agents Embedded with cloning mechanisms, an agent can balance its own loads by discharging computing tasks to its clones when it is over-loaded. In addition, it's more reasonable to transfer the smarter, smaller clones of an agent rather than the bulky agent itself in mobile computing. In this paper, a simple BDI agent model is formally established. Using this model, the semantics of constructing new agents by inheritance and self-identifying behavior of existing agents are precisely de  ned. Four kinds of cloning mechanisms are identi  ed, the properties of each cloning mechanism and the relationships in between are studied, and some implementation issues are also discussed.

Information Retrieval on the World Wide Web and Active Logic: A Survey and Problem Definition As more information becomes available on the World Wide Web (there are currently over 4 billion pages covering most areas of human endeavor), it becomes more difficult to provide effective search tools for information access. Today, people access web information through two main kinds of search interfaces: Browsers (clicking and following hyperlinks) and Query Engines (queries in the form of a set of keywords showing the topic of interest). The first process is tentative and time consuming and the second may not satisfy the user because of many inaccurate and irrelevant results. Better support is needed for expressing one's information need and returning high quality search results by web search tools. There appears to be a need for systems that do reasoning under uncertainty and are flexible enough to recover from the contradictions, inconsistencies, and irregularities that such reasoning involves.

DyDa: Dynamic Data Warehouse Maintenance in a Fully Concurrent Environment Data warehouse is an emerging technology to support high-level decision making by gathering data from several distributed information sources into one repository. In dynamic environments, data warehouses must be maintained in order to stay consistent with the underlying sources. Recently proposed view maintenance algorithms tackle the problem of data warehouse maintenance under concurrent source data updates.While the view synchronization is to handle non-concurrent source schema changes. However, the concurrency between interleaved schema changes and data updates still remain unexplored problems.  In this paper, we propose a solution framework called DyDa that successfully addresses this problem. The DyDa framework detects concurrent schema changes by a broken query scheme and conicting concurrent data updates by a local timestamp scheme. A fundamental idea of the DyDa framework is the development of a two-layered architecture that separates the concerns for concurrent data updates and concurrent schema changes handling without imposing any restrictions on the sourse update transactions. At the lower level of the framework, it employs a local compensation algorithm to handle concurrent data updates, and a metadata name mapping strategy to handle concurrent source rename operations. At the higher level, it addresses the problem of concurrent source drop operations. For the latter problem, we design a strategy for the detection and correction of such concurrency and nd an executable plan for the aected updates. We then develop a new view adaption algorithm, called Batch-VA for execution of such plan to incrementally adapt the view. Put together, these algorithms are the rst to provide a complete solution to data warehouse management in a fully concurrent environment....

Antisocial Agents and Vickrey Auctions In recent years auctions have become more and more important in  the field of multiagent systems as useful mechanisms for resource allocation and  task assignment. In many cases the Vickrey (second-price sealed-bid) auction  is used as a protocol that prescribes how the individual agents have to interact  in order to come to an agreement. We show that the Vickrey auction, despite  its theoretical benefits, is inappropriate if "antisocial" agents participate in the  auction process. More specifically, an antisocial attitude for economic agents that  makes reducing the profit of competitors their main goal besides maximizing their  own profit is introduced. Under this novel condition, agents need to deviate from  the dominant truth-telling strategy. This paper presents a strategy for bidders in  repeated Vickrey auctions who are intending to inflict losses to fellow agents in  order to be more successful, not in absolute measures, but relatively to the group  of bidders. The strategy is evaluated in a simple task allocation scenario.

Practical Guidelines for the Readability of IT-architecture Diagrams This paper presents the work done to establish guidelines for the creation of readable IT-architecture diagrams and gives some examples of guidelines and some examples of improved diagrams. These guidelines are meant to assist practicing IT-architects in preparing the diagrams to communicate their architectures to the various stakeholders. Diagramming has always been important in information technology (IT), but the recent interest in ITarchitecture, the widespread use of software and developments in electronic communication, make it necessary to again look at the rt of making diagrams'for this particular class and its users. The guidelines indicate how various visual attributes, like hierarchy, layout, color, form, graphics, etc. can contribute to the readability of IT-architecture diagrams. The emphasis is on the outward appearance of diagrams. Some additional support is given for the thinking/reasoning processes while designing or using a set of diagrams and an attempt is made to arrive at a rationale of these guidelines. An evaluation process has been performed with three groups of practicing IT-architects. The outcome of this evaluation is presented. This work is part of a more comprehensive research project on "Visualisation of IT- architecture".

Rough Set Theory: A Data Mining Tool for Semiconductor Manufacturing The growing volume of information poses interesting challenges and calls for tools that discover properties of data. Data mining has emerged as a discipline that contributes tools for data analysis, discovery of new knowledge, and autonomous decisionmaking. In this paper, the basic concepts of rough set theory and other aspects of data mining are introduced. The rough set theory offers a viable approach for extraction of decision rules from data sets. The extracted rules can be used for making predictions in the semiconductor industry and other applications. This contrasts other approaches such as regression analysis and neural networks where a single model is built. One of the goals of data mining is to extract meaningful knowledge. The power, generality, accuracy, and longevity of decision rules can be increased by the application of concepts from systems engineering and evolutionary computation introduced in this paper. A new rule-structuring algorithm is proposed. The concepts presented in the paper are illustrated with examples.

Support Vector Machines for Classification and Regression The problem of empirical data modelling is germane to many engineering applications. In empirical data modelling a process of induction is used to build up a model of the system, from which it is hoped to deduce responses of the system that have yet to be observed. Ultimately the quantity and quality of the observations govern the performance of this empirical model. By its observational nature data obtained is finite and sampled; typically this sampling is non-uniform and due to the high dimensional nature of the problem the data will form only a sparse distribution in the input space. Consequently the problem is nearly always ill posed (Poggio et al., 1985) in the sense of Hadamard (Hadamard, 1923). Traditional neural network approaches have suffered difficulties with generalisation, producing models that can overfit the data. This is a consequence of the optimisation algorithms used for parameter selection and the statistical measures used to select the ‚Äôbest‚Äô model. The foundations of Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been developed by Vapnik (1995) and are gaining popularity due to many attractive features, and promising empirical performance. The formulation embodies the Structural Risk Minimisation (SRM) principle, which has been shown to be superior, (Gunn et al., 1997), to traditional Empirical Risk Minimisation (ERM) principle, employed by conventional neural networks. SRM minimises an upper bound on the expected risk, as opposed to ERM that minimises the error on the training data. It is this difference which equips SVM with a greater ability to generalise, which is the goal in statistical learning. SVMs were developed to solve the classification problem, but recently they have been extended to the domain of regression problems (Vapnik et al., 1997). In the literature the terminology for SVMs can be slightly confusing. The term SVM is typically used to describe classification with support vector methods and support vector regression is used to describe regression with support vector methods. In this report the term SVM will refer to both classification and regression methods, and the terms Support Vector Classification (SVC) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) will be used for specification. This section continues with a brief introduction to the structural risk

Learning with Deictic Representation Most reinforcement learning methods operate on propositional representations of the world state. Such representations are often intractably large and generalize poorly. Using a deictic representation is believed to be a viable alternative: they promise generalization while allowing the use of existing reinforcement-learning methods. Yet, there are few experiments on learning with deictic representations reported in the literature. In this paper we explore the effectiveness of two forms of deictic representation and a na√Øve propositional representation in a simple blocks-world domain. We find, empirically, that the deictic representations actually worsen performance. We conclude with a discussion of possible causes of these results and strategies for more effective learning in domains with objects. 1

Context Filters for Document-Based Information Filtering In this paper we propose a keyPhrase-sense disambiguation methodology called "context filters" for use in keyPhrase based information filtering systems. A context filter finds whether an input keyPhrase has occurred in the required context. Context filters consider various factors of ambiguity. Some of these factors are special to information filtering and they are handled in a structured fashion. The proposed context filters are very comprehensibile. Context filters consider varieties of contexts which are not considered in existing word-sense disambiguation methods but these are all needed for information filtering. The ideas on context filters that we report in this paper form important elements of an Instructible Information Filtering Agent that we are developing. 1.

Gaia: Enabling Active Spaces Ubiquitous computing promotes physical spaces with hundreds of specialized embedded devices that increase our productivity, alleviate some specific everyday tasks and provide new ways of interacting with the computational environment. Personal computers lose the focus of attention due to the fact that the computational environment is spread across the physical space. Therefore, the users' view of the computational environment is finally extended beyond the physical limits of the computer. Physical spaces become computer systems, or in other terms, Active Spaces.

Fuzzy Concepts and Formal Methods: A Fuzzy Logic Toolkit for Z It has been recognised that formal methods are useful as a modelling tool in requirements engineering. Specification languages such as Z permit the precise and unambiguous modelling of system properties and behaviour. However some system problems, particularly those drawn from the IS problem domain, may be difficult to model in crisp or precise terms. It may also be desirable that formal modelling should commence as early as possible, even when our understanding of parts of the problem domain is only approximate. This paper suggests fuzzy set theory as a possible representation scheme for this imprecision or approximation. We provide a summary of a toolkit that defines the operators, measures and modifiers necessary for the manipulation of fuzzy sets and relations. We also provide some examples of the laws which establishes an isomorphism between the extended notation presented here and conventional Z when applied to boolean sets and relations.

Choosing Good Distance Metrics and Local Planners for Probabilistic Roadmap Methods This paper presents a comparative evaluation of different distance metrics and local planners within the context of probabilistic roadmap methods for motion planning. Both C-space and Workspace distance metrics and local planners are considered. The study concentrates on cluttered three-dimensional Workspaces typical, e.g., of mechanical designs. Our results include recommendations for selecting appropriate combinations of distance metrics and local planners for use in motion planning methods, particularly probabilistic roadmap methods. Our study of distance metrics showed that the importance of the translational distance increased relative to the rotational distance as the environment become more crowded. We find that each local planner makes some connections than none of the others do ‚Äî indicating that better connected roadmaps will be constructed using multiple local planners. We propose a new local planning method we call rotate-at-s that outperforms the common straight-line in C-space method in crowded environments.

A Tutorial on Support Vector Machines for Pattern Recognition Abstract. The tutorial starts with an overview of the concepts of VC dimension and structural risk minimization. We then describe linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs) for separable and non-separable data, working through a non-trivial example in detail. We describe a mechanical analogy, and discuss when SVM solutions are unique and when they are global. We describe how support vector training can be practically implemented, and discuss in detail the kernel mapping technique which is used to construct SVM solutions which are nonlinear in the data. We show how Support Vector machines can have very large (even infinite) VC dimension by computing the VC dimension for homogeneous polynomial and Gaussian radial basis function kernels. While very high VC dimension would normally bode ill for generalization performance, and while at present there exists no theory which shows that good generalization performance is guaranteed for SVMs, there are several arguments which support the observed high accuracy of SVMs, which we review. Results of some experiments which were inspired by these arguments are also presented. We give numerous examples and proofs of most of the key theorems. There is new material, and I hope that the reader will find that even old material is cast in a fresh light.

PicASHOW: Pictorial Authority Search by Hyperlinks on the Web We describe PicASHOW, a fully automated WWW image retrieval system that is based on several link-structure analyzing algorithms. Our basic premise is that a page # displays (or links to) an image when the author of # considers the image to be of value to the viewers of the page. Wethus extend some well known link-based WWW #### ######### schemes to the context of image retrieval.  PicASHOW's analysis of the link structure enables it to retrieve relevant images even when those are stored in les with meaningless names. The same analysis also allows it to identify ##### ########## and ##### ####. We dene these as Web pages that are rich in relevant images, or from which many images are readily accessible.  PicASHOW requires no image analysis whatsoever and no creation of taxonomies for pre-classication of the Web's images. It can be implemented by standard WWW search engines with reasonable overhead, in terms of both computations and storage, and with no change to user query formats. It can thus be used to easily add image retrieving capabilities to standard search engines.  Our results demonstrate that PicASHOW, while relying almost exclusively on link analysis, compares well with dedicated WWW image retrieval systems. We conclude that link analysis, a bona-de eective technique for Web page search, can improve the performance of Web image retrieval, as well as extend its denition to include the retrieval of image hubs and containers.

The best performance was achieved by the feature selection methods based on the feature scoring measure called Odds ratio that is known from information retrieval.

Criterion Functions for Document Clustering: Experiments and Analysis In recent years, we have witnessed a tremendous growth in the volume of text documents available on the Internet,  digital libraries, news sources, and company-wide intranets. This has led to an increased interest in developing  methods that can help users to effectively navigate, summarize, and organize this information with the ultimate  goal of helping them to find what they are looking for. Fast and high-quality document clustering algorithms play an  important role towards this goal as they have been shown to provide both an intuitive navigation/browsing mechanism  by organizing large amounts of information into a small number of meaningful clusters as well as to greatly improve  the retrieval performance either via cluster-driven dimensionality reduction, term-weighting, or query expansion. This  ever-increasing importance of document clustering and the expanded range of its applications led to the development  of a number of new and novel algorithms with different complexity-quality trade-offs. Among them, a class of  clustering algorithms that have relatively low computational requirements are those that treat the clustering problem  as an optimization process which seeks to maximize or minimize a particular clustering criterion function defined  over the entire clustering solution.

Focused Crawls, Tunneling, and Digital Libraries Crawling the Web to build collections of documents related  to pre-specified topics became an active area of research during the late  1990's after crawler technology was developed for the benefit of search  engines. Now, Web crawling is being seriously considered as an important  strategy for building large scale digital libraries. This paper considers  some of the crawl technologies that might be exploited for collection  building. For example, to make such collection-building crawls more effective,  focused crawling was developed, in which the goal was to make  a "best-first" crawl of the Web. We are using powerful crawler software  to implement a focused crawl but use tunneling to overcome some of the  limitations of a pure best-first approach. Tunneling has been described  by others as not only prioritizing links from pages according to the page's  relevance score, but also estimating the value of each link and prioritizing  on that as well. We add to this mix by devising a tunneling focused  crawling strategy which evaluates the current crawl direction on the fly to  determine when to terminate a tunneling activity. Results indicate that  a combination of focused crawling and tunneling could be an e#ective  tool for building digital libraries.

The work in this experiment was characterized by several full group meetings (for planning and coordination) interspersed with periods of individual activity (asychronous work) and smaller coordination meetings of two or three team members around the "hand-off" of output from a task used as input for another task.  Collected Data  The native version of TW produces a server-based log-file that contains information about the identity of users entering the distributed application, the identity of the rooms through which users navigate, file uploads, and message passing between users. This set of interactions was deemed too rudimentary for capturing the type of data needed for usability analysis. Since the source co

Learning and Evaluating Visual Features for Pose Estimation We present a method for learning a set of visual landmarks which are useful for pose estimation. The landmark learning mechanism is designed to be applicable to a wide range of environments, and generalized for different approaches to computing a pose estimate. Initially, each landmark is detected as a local extremum of a measure of distinctiveness and represented by a principal components encoding which is exploited for matching. Attributes of the observed landmarks can be parameterized using a generic parameterization method and then evaluated in terms of their utility for pose estimation. We present experimental evidence that demonstrates the utility of the method. 1 Introduction In this paper, we develop an approach to visionbased robot localization by learning a set of imagedomain landmarks in the robot's environment. The landmarks are learned from a representative set of images obtained during an initial exploration of the environment. No a priori assumptions are made about the...

Real-Time Scheduling for Distributed Agents Providing an environment for a software agent to execute  is very similar to building an operating system for  the execution of general purpose applications. In the  same fashion that an operating system provides a set  of services for the execution of a user request, an agent  framework provides a similar set of services for the execution  of agent actions. Such services include the ability  to communicate with other agents, maintaining the  current state of an executing agent, and selecting an  execution path from a set of possible execution paths.  The particular focus of this paper is the study of Soft  Real-Time agentscheduling in the context of a framework  for the execution of intelligent software agents;  acharacterization of agent performance; and developmentofanenvironment  for testing and comparing the  performance of agent activities.

Constraints and Agents in MADEsmart As part of the DARPA Rapid Design Exploration and Optimization (RaDEO) program, Boeing, Philadelphia, is involved in an on-going concurrent design engineering research project called MADEsmart which seeks to partially automate the Integrated Product Team (IPT) concept used by Boeing for organizing the design engineering process, with the aid of intelligent agent technology. Although currently only in an early stage of development, the project is expected to crucially employ a constraint-centered System Design Management Agent developed by the University of Toronto's IE Department in conjunction with Boeing. The SDMA will use the constraint-based Toronto Ontologies for a Virtual Enterprise (TOVE) ontologies, and its domain theories for design engineering and dependent underlying theories, phrased as KIF/Ontolingua assertions in an axiomatic system running in the constraint logic system ECLiPSe, as its primary knowledge resource to monitor an ongoing design project, offering resource-all...

Scalable Algorithms for Large-Scale Temporal Aggregation The ability to model time-varying natures is essential to many database applications such as data warehousing and mining. However, the temporal aspects provide many unique characteristics and challenges for query processing and optimization. Among the challenges is computing temporal aggregates, which is complicated by having to compute temporal grouping. In this paper, we introduce a variety of temporal aggregation algorithms that overcome major drawbacks of previous work. First, for small-scale aggregations, both the worst-case and average-case processing time have been improved significantly. Second, for large-scale aggregations, the proposed algorithms can deal with a database that is substantially larger than the size of available memory. Third, the parallel algorithm designed on a shared-nothing architecture achieves scalable performance by delivering nearly linear scale-up and speed-up. The contributions made in this paper are particularly important because the rate of increase ...

Automatic Multi-Lingual Information Extraction Information Extraction (IE) is a burgeoning technique because of the explosion of internet. So far, most of the IE systems are focusing on English text; and most of them are in the supervised learning framework, which requires large amount of human labor; and most of them can only work in narrow domain, which is domain dependent. These systems are difficult to be ported to other languages, other domains because of these inherent shortcomings. Currently, besides western languages like English, there are many other Asian languages which are much di erent from English. In English, words are delimited by white-spaces so computer can easily tokenize the input text string. In many languages like Chinese, Japanese, Thai and Korea, they do not have word boundaries between words. This poses a difficult problem for the information extraction for those languages. In this thesis, we intend to implement a self-contained, language independent automatic IE system. The system is automatic because we are using a unsupervised learning framework in which no labeled data is required for training or a semi-supervised learning framework in which small amount of labeled data and large amount of unlabeled data are used. Specifically, we deal with Chinese and English languages name entity recognition and entity relation extraction, but the system can be easily extended to any other languages and other tasks. We implement an unsupervised Chinese word segmenter, a Chinese POS tagger, and we extend maximum entropy models to incorporate unlabeled data for general information extraction.

The Vagabond Parallel Temporal Object-Oriented Database System: Versatile Support for Future Applications . In this paper, we discuss features that future database systems should support to deliver  the required functionality and performance to future applications. The most important features are  efficient support for: 1) large objects, 2) isochronous delivery of data, 3) queries on large data sets,  4) full text indexing, 5) multidimensional data, 6) sparse data, and 7) temporal data and versioning.  To efficiently support these features in one integrated system, a new database architecture is needed.

Cooperative Learning over Composite Search Spaces: Experiences with a Multi-agent Design System We suggest the use of two learning techniques --- short term and long term --- to enhance search efficiency in a multi-agent design system by letting the agents learn about non-local requirements on the local search process. The first technique allows an agent to accumulate and apply constraining information about global problem solving, gathered as a result of agent communication, to further problem solving within the same problem instance. The second technique is used to classify problem instances and appropriately index and retrieve constraining information to apply to new problem instances. These techniques will be presented within the context of a multi-agent parametricdesign application called STEAM. We show that learning conclusively improves solution quality and processingtime results.

Beyond Euclidean Eigenspaces: Bayesian Matching for Visual Recognition We propose a novel technique for direct visual matching of images for the purposes of face  recognition and database search. Speci#cally,we argue in favor of a probabilistic measure of  similarity, in contrast to simpler methods which are based on standard Euclidean L2 norms #e.g.,  template matching# or subspace-restricted norms #e.g., eigenspace matching#. The proposed  similarity measure is based on a Bayesian analysis of image di#erences: we model twomutually  exclusive classes of variation between two facial images: intra-personal #variations in appearance  of the same individual, due to di#erent expressions or lighting# and extra-personal #variations in  appearance due to a di#erence in identity#. The high-dimensional probability density functions  for each respective class are then obtained from training data using an eigenspace density  estimation technique and subsequently used to compute a similarity measure based on the a  posteriori probability of membership in the intra-personal class, which is used to rank matches  in the database. The performance advantage of this probabilistic matching technique over  standard Euclidean nearest-neighbor eigenspace matching is demonstrated using results from  ARPA's 1996 #FERET" face recognition competition, in which this algorithm was found to be  the top performer.

Fuzzy Concepts and Formal Methods: Some Illustrative Examples It has been recognised that formal methods are useful as a modelling tool in requirements engineering. Specification languages such as Z permit the precise and unambiguous modelling of system properties and behaviour. However some system problems, particularly those drawn from the IS problem domain, may be difficult to model in crisp or precise terms. It may also be desirable that formal modelling should commence as early as possible, even when our understanding of parts of the problem domain is only approximate. This paper identifies the problem types of interest and argues that they are characterised by uncertainty and imprecision. It suggests fuzzy set theory as a useful formalism for modelling aspects of this imprecision. The paper illustrates how a fuzzy logic tooklit for Z can be applied to such problem domains. Several examples are presented illustrating the representation of imprecise concepts as fuzzy sets and relations, soft pre- conditions and system requirements as a series of linguistically quantified propositions. 1

Constructing and Transforming CBR Implementations: Techniques for Corporate Memory Management Achieving widespread case-based reasoning support for corporate memories will require the flexibility to integrate implementations with existing organizational resources and infrastructure. Case-based reasoning implementations as currently constructed tend to fall into three categories, characterized by implementation constraints: task-based (task constraints alone), enterprise (integrating databases), and web-based (integrating web representations) . These implementation types represent the possible targets in constructing corporate memory systems, and it is important to understand the strengths of each, how they are built, and how one may be constructed by transforming another. This paper describes a framework that relates the three types of CBR implementation, discusses their typical strengths and weaknesses, and describes practical strategies for building corporate CBR memories to meet new requirements by transforming and synthesizing existing resources.  1 Introduction  Constructi...

Using Database Optimization Techniques for Nonmonotonic Reasoning In this paper a program rewriting technique for disjunctive datalog is proposed, which descends from query optimization techniques in relational algebra and reduces the size of the ground instantiation of a program in many cases. As a consequence, the time for generating the ground instantiation and the time for subsequent operations on the ground program is shortened. A part of this technique has already been implemented as a preprocessing step in the Disjunctive Deductive Database System dlv. Using a recently published application, we show that a signicant reduction of the ground program size and a tremendous overall speedup can be achieved. 1 Introduction dlv is a Disjunctive Deductive Database System implementing the Consistent Answer Sets Semantics.

Effective Site Finding using Link Anchor Information Link-based ranking methods have been described in the literature and applied in commercial Web search engines. However, according to recent TREC experiments, they are no better than traditional content-based methods. We conduct a different type of experiment, in which the task is to find the main entry point of a specific Web site. In our experiments, ranking based on link anchor text is twice as effective as ranking based on document content, even though both methods used the same BM25 formula. We obtained these results using two sets of 100 queries on a 18.5 million docu- ment set and another set of 100 on a 0.4 million document set. This site finding effectiveness begins to explain why many search engines have adopted link methods. It also opens a rich new area for effectiveness improvement, where traditional methods fail.

Composable Agents for Patient Flow Control - Preliminary Concepts In this article we describe our research efforts in coping with a trade-off that can be often found in the control and optimization of todays business processes. Though centralized control may achieve better results in controlling the system behavior, there are usually social, technical and security constraints on applying centralized control. Distributed control on the other hand may cope with these constraints but also entails suboptimal results and communicational overhead. Our concept of composable agents tries to allow a dynamic and fluent transition between globalization and localization in business process control by adapting to the current real-world system structure. We are currently evaluating this concept in the framework of a patient flow control project at Charit'e Berlin.

A Query Calculus for Spatio-Temporal Object Databases The development of any comprehensive proposal for spatio-temporal databases involves significant extensions to many aspects of a non-spatio-temporal architecture. One aspect that has received less attention than most is the development of a query calculus that can be used to provide a semantics for spatio-temporal queries and underpin an effective query optimization and evaluation framework. In this paper, we show how a query calculus for spatiotemporal object databases that builds upon the monoid calculus proposed by Fegaras and Maier for ODMG-compliant database systems can be developed. The paper shows how an extension of the ODMG type system with spatial and temporal types can be accommodated into the monoid approach. It uses several queries over historical (possibly spatial) data to illustrate how, by mapping them into monoid comprehensions, the way is open for the application of a logical optimizer based on the normalization algorithm proposed by Fegaras and Maier.

We discuss the tradeoffs involved in control of complex articulated agents, and present three implemented controllers for a complex task: a physically-based humanoid torso dancing the Macarena. The three controllers are drawn from animation, biological models, and robotics, and illustrate the issues of joint-space vs. Cartesian space task specification and implementation.

Segment-Based Approach for Subsequence Searches in Sequence Databases This paper investigates the subsequence searching problem under time warping in sequence databases. Time warping enables to find sequences with similar changing patterns even when they are of different lengths. Our work is motivated by the observation that subsequence searches slow down quadratically as the total length of data sequences increases. To resolve this problem, we propose the SegmentBased Approach for Subsequence Searches (SBASS), which modifies the similarity measure from time warping to piecewise time warping and limits the number of possible subsequences to be compared with a query sequence.  For efficient retrieval of similar subsequences without false dismissal  1  , we extract feature vectors from all data segments exploiting their monotonically changing properties, and build a multi-dimensional index such as R-tree or R  - tree. Using this index, queries are processed with four steps: 1) index filtering, 2) feature filtering, 3) successor filtering, and 4) post-proce...

Scenario Customization for Information Extraction Information Extraction (IE) is an emerging NLP technology, whose function is to process unstructured, natural language text, to locate specific pieces of information, or facts, in the text, and to use these facts to fill a database. IE systems today are commonly based on pattern matching. The core IE engine uses a cascade of sets of patterns of increasing linguistic complexity. Each pattern consists of a regular expression and an associated mapping from syntactic to logical form. The pattern sets are customized for each new topic, as defined by the set of facts to be extracted. Construction of a pattern base for a new topic is recognized as a time-consuming and expensive process---a principal roadblock to wider use of IE technology in the large. An e#ective pattern base must be precise and have wide coverage. This thesis addresses the portability probl...

Integrity Constraints: Semantics and Applications this paper.) Finally, by having ICs expressed in logic, one can use deduction and logic as one's basic and natural tools for handling, and reasoning over, database specifications (facts, rules, queries, and ICs). This applies for relational databases, with or without rules, and can be applied to object-oriented and object-relational databases as well. There is a broad body of work on logic and relational databases, and a general consensus on what databases (facts and rules) and queries mean. However, there is less work on the meaning of integrity constraints, and certainly no consensus. What is meant by an IC can differ widely. For instance, one may define that ICs must be consistent with the database, or define that they must be provable statements, deducible from the database. (This distinction is discussed in more detail in Section 3.2.) Another view is that ICs really represent meta-knowledge---knowledge about the database itself---and should, perhaps, be written in a nonclassical logic. The general situation becomes more complex when we permit databases to contain indefinite or disjunctive information or to use negation, as with IC 2 above. Subtle but profound differences in meaning can arise due to different interpretations of ICs. In many systems, the semantics for ICs is never made clear; at times, one interpretation seems intended, while at other times, another interpretation is evident. This ambiguity is dangerous, and could allow a database to become corrupt in unanticipated ways. In this chapter, we introduce integrity constraints in a logical framework and overview the various work that has been done on ICs in this context. Section 2 presents the basic definitions for databases and integrity constraints for the chapter. We consider various semantics of ICs,...

Theme-Based Retrieval of Web News Efficient information retrieval of highly dynamic information, such as Web news, is a complex task. As a result, search and retrieval environments for continuously updated news from other sources than the largest media conglomerates are almost absent on the Internet. Global search engines do not index or classify news information from smaller network communities. To address this problem, I developed NewsSearch, a news information management environment designed to improve retrieval efficiency of online news for the smaller networked communities.  NewsSearch search achieves its goal through a combination of techniques:  . Multiple indexing queues, defining multiple gathering schedules, to deal with different publication periodicities.  . Information Retrieval techniques to news, in order to classify them into a pre-defined set of themes.  . Support Vector Machines, which proved to be a fast and reliable classification technique.  NewsSearch proved to be a scalable solution with acceptable storage needs even while managing a fairly large collection of daily publications. A combination of fine tuning of training strategies, noise filtering of Web news documents and multiple classifications, enable NewsSearch to achieve a classification accuracy of 95%.

Learning reactive robot behaviors with Neural-Q_leaning The purpose of this paper is to propose a Neural-Q_learning approach designed for online learning of simple and reactive robot behaviors. In this approach, the Q_function is generalized by a multi-layer neural network allowing the use of continuous states and actions. The algorithm uses a database of the most recent learning samples to accelerate and guarantee the convergence. Each Neural-Q_learning function represents an independent, reactive and adaptive behavior which maps sensorial states to robot control actions. A group of these behaviors constitutes a reactive control scheme designed to fulfill simple missions. The paper centers on the description of the Neural-Q_learning based behaviors showing their performance with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in a target following mission. Simulated experiments demonstrate the convergence and stability of the learning system, pointing out its suitability for online robot learning. Advantages and limitations are discussed.

Towards Flexible Multi-Agent Decision-Making Under Time Pressure Abstract ‚Äî Autonomous agents need considerable computational resources to perform rational decision-making. These demands are even more severe when other agents are present in the environment. In these settings, the quality of an agent‚Äôs alternative behaviors depends not only on the state of the environment, but also on the actions of other agents, which in turn depend on the others ‚Äô beliefs about the world, their preferences, and further on the other agents‚Äô beliefs about others, and so on. The complexity becomes prohibitive when large number of agents are present and when decisions have to be made under time pressure. In this paper we investigate strategies intended to tame the computational burden by using off-line computation in conjunction with on-line reasoning. We investigate two approaches. First, we use rules compiled off-line to constrain alternative actions considered during on-line reasoning. This method minimizes overhead, but is not sensitive to changes in realtime demands of the situation at hand. Second, we use performance profiles computed off-line and the notion of urgency (i.e., the value of time) computed on-line to choose the amount of information to be included during on-line deliberation. This method can adjust to various levels of real-time demands, but incurs some overhead associated with iterative deepening. We test our framework with experiments in a simulated anti-air defense domain. The experiments show that both procedures are effective in reducing computation time while offering good performance under time pressure.

Relevance Feedback and Query Expansion for Searching the Web: A Model for Searching a Digital Library :  A fully operational large scale digital library is likely to be based on a distributed architecture and because of this it is likely that a number of independent search engines may be used to index different overlapping portions of the entire contents of the library. In any case, different media, text, audio, image, etc., will be indexed for retrieval by different search engines so techniques which provide a coherent and unified search over a suite of underlying independent search engines are thus likely to be an important part of navigating in a digital library. In this paper we present an architecture and a system for searching the world's largest DL, the world wide web. What makes our system novel is that we use a suite of underlying web search engines to do the bulk of the work while our system orchestrates them in a parallel fashion to provide a higher level of information retrieval functionality. Thus it is our meta search engine and not the underlying direct search engines th...

On Case-Based Representability and Learnability of Languages . Within the present paper we investigate case-based representability as well as case-based learnability of indexed families of uniformly recursive languages. Since we are mainly interested in case-based learning with respect to an arbitrary fixed similarity measure, case-based learnability of an indexed family requires its representability, first. We show that every indexed family is case-based representable by positive and negative cases. If only positive cases are allowed the class of representable families is comparatively small. Furthermore, we present results that provide some bounds concerning the necessary size of case bases. We study, in detail, how the choice of a case selection strategy influences the learning capabilities of a case-based learner. We define different case selection strategies and compare their learning power to one another. Furthermore, we elaborate the relations to Gold-style language learning from positive and both positive and negative examples. 1 Introdu...

In this paper, we study ECA rules in the  context of XML data. We define a simple language for specifying ECA rules on XML  repositories. The language is illustrated by means of some examples, and its syntax and  semantics are then specified more formally. We then investigate methods for analysing and  optimising these ECA rules, a task which has added complexity in this XML setting compared  with conventional active databases.  1

Maximum Likelihood Estimation for Filtering Thresholds Information filtering systems based on statistical retrieval models usually compute a numeric score indicating how well each document matches each profile. Documents with scores above profile-specific dissemination thresholds are delivered.  An optimal dissemination threshold is one that maximizes a given utility function based on the distributions of the scores of relevant and non-relevant documents. The parameters of the distribution can be estimated using relevance information, but relevance information obtained while filtering is biased. This paper presents a new method of adjusting dissemination thresholds that explicitly models and compensates for this bias. The new algorithm, which is based on the Maximum Likelihood principle, jointly estimates the parameters of the density distributions for relevant and nonrelevant documents and the ratio of the relevant document in the corpus. Experiments with TREC-8 and TREC-9 Filtering Track data demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.  Keywords  Information Filtering, Dissemination Threshold, Maximum Likelihood Estimation.  1.

Using Labeled and Unlabeled Data to Learn Drifting Concepts For many learning tasks, where data is collected  over an extended period of time, one has to cope  two problems. The distribution underlying the data  is likely to change and only little labeled training  data is available at each point in time. A typical  example is information filtering, i. e. the adaptive  classification of documents with respect to a particular  user interest. Both the interest of the user  and the document content change over time. A filtering  system should be able to adapt to such concept  changes. Since users often give little feedback,  a filtering system should also be able to achieve a  good performance, even if only few labeled training  examples are provided. This paper proposes a  method to recognize and handle concept changes  with support vector machines and to use unlabeled  data to reduce the need for labeled data. The  method maintains windows on the training data,  whose size is automatically adjusted so that the estimated  generalization error is minimized. The approach  is both theoretically well-founded as well  as effective and efficient in practice. Since it does  not require complicated parameterization, it is simpler  to use and more robust than comparable heuristics.  Experiments with simulated concept drift scenarios  based on real-world text data compare the  new method with other window management approaches  and show that it can effectively select an  appropriate window size in a robust way. In order  to achieve an acceptable performance with fewer  labeled training examples, the proposed method exploits  unlabeled examples in a transductive way.  1

Relating Chemical Structure to Activity: An Application of the Neural Folding Architecture : This paper is based on the neural folding architecture (FA). The FA is a recurrent neural network architecture which is especially suited for adaptive structure processing, i.e. learning approximations of mappings from symbolic term structures to IR  n  . The main objective of this paper is to demonstrate that the FA can be successfully applied to approximate quantitative structure activity relationships (QSARs), which play an important role during a drug design process. Several approaches for the conversion of a QSAR problem to suitable learning tasks for the FA are presented. Finally the FA is applied to a well-known QSAR benchmark, viz. the inhibition of E. coli dihydrofolate reductase by triazines. The achieved results are compared with results of other machine learning approaches on the same QSAR benchmark, and prove that the FA is significantly better.

Complex Aggregation at Multiple Granularities . Datacube queries compute simple aggregates at multiple granularities. In this paper we examine the more general and useful problem of computing a complex subquery involving multiple dependent aggregates at multiple granularities. We call such queries "multi-feature cubes." An example is "Broken down by all combinations of month and customer, find the fraction of the total sales in 1996 of a particular item due to suppliers supplying within 10% of the minimum price (within the group), showing all subtotals across each dimension." We classify multi-feature cubes based on the extent to which fine granularity results can be used to compute coarse granularity results; this classification includes distributive, algebraic and holistic multi-feature cubes. We provide syntactic sufficient conditions to determine when a multi-feature cube is either distributive or algebraic. This distinction is important because, as we show, existing datacube evaluation algorithms can be used to compute multif...

A Cellular System for Pattern Recognition using Associative Neural Networks : A cellular system for pattern recognition is presented in this paper. The cells are placed in a two dimensional array and they are capable of performing basic symbolic processing and exchanging messages about their state. Following a cellular automata like operation the aim of the system is to transform an initial symbolic description of a pattern to a correspondent object level representation. To this end, a hierarchical approach for the description of the structure of the patterns is followed. The underlying processing engine of the system is the AURA model of associative memory. The system is endowed with a learning mechanism utilizing the distributed nature of the architecture. A dedicated hardware platform is also available. 1 Introduction One of the basic characteristics of cellular automata [1] is their ability for parallel and distributed processing.

A Data Mining Framework for Building Intrusion Detection Models There is often the need to update an installed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) due to new attack methods or upgraded computing environments. Since many current IDSs are constructed by manual encoding of expert knowledge, changes to IDSs are expensive and slow. In this paper, we describe a data mining framework for adaptively building Intrusion Detection (ID) models. The central idea is to utilize auditing programs to extract an extensive set of features that describe each network connection or host session, and apply data mining programs to learn rules that accurately capture the behavior of intrusions and normal activities. These rules can then be used for misuse detection and anomaly detection. New detection models are incorporated into an existing IDS through a meta-learning (or co-operative learning) process, which produces a meta detection model that combines evidence from multiple models. We discuss the strengths of our data mining programs, namely, classification, meta-learning...

TrIAs: Trainable Information Assistants for Cooperative Problem Solving Software agents are intended to perform certain tasks on behalf of their users. In many cases, however, the agent's competence is not sufficient to produce the desired outcome. This paper presents an approach to cooperative problem solving in which an information agent and its user try to support each other in the achievement of a particular goal. As a side effect the user can extend the agent's capabilities in a programming-by-demonstration dialog, thus enabling it to autonomously perform similar tasks in the future.  1 Introduction  Software agents are intended to autonomously perform certain tasks on behalf of their users. In many cases, however, the agent's competence might not be sufficient to produce the desired outcome.

The Effect of Network Hierarchy Structure on Performance of ATM PNNI Hierarchical Routing Networks deploying hierarchical routing are recursively partitioned into sub-networks that do not reveal the full details of their internal structure outside their domains. Instead, an aggregated view of certain parameters that are associated with traversal within such sub-networks between their border nodes is advertised. The ATM PNNI standard and the Internet Nimrod architecture both adopt this approach for routing.  This paper studies the effectiveness of ATM hierarchical routing protocols on networks with different hierarchical structures by simulation. Our study shows that, in general, the hierarchical source routing performs well compared to the global routing strategy which imposes no hierarchy, while utilizing less storage and communication overhead. For certain networks and topologies, the hierarchical routing performs better than the global routing. Different hierarchies imposed on the same topologies have significantly different performance on the throughput and routing dela...

Web Document Clustering: A Feasibility Demonstration Abstract Users of Web search engines are often forced to sift through the long ordered list of document ‚Äúsnippets‚Äù returned by the engines. The IR community has explored document clustering as an alternative method of organizing retrieval results, but clustering has yet to be deployed on the major search engines. The paper articulates the unique requirements of Web document clustering and reports on the first evaluation of clustering methods in this domain. A key requirement is that the methods create their clusters based on the short snippets returned by Web search engines. Surprisingly, we find that clusters based on snippets are almost as good as clusters created using the full text of Web documents. To satisfy the stringent requirements of the Web domain, we introduce an incremental, linear time (in the document collection size) algorithm called Suffix Tree Clustering (STC). which creates clusters based on phrases shared between documents. We show that STC is faster than standard clustering methods in this domain, and argue that Web document clustering via STC is both feasible and potentially beneficial. 1

We have integrated these tools within a modular architecture based on a generic model allowing us on the one hand flexible annotation of the corpus with the output of NLP and statistical tools and on the other hand retracing the results of these tools through the annotation layers back to the primary textual data. This allows us to justify our interpretations.  1. Introduction  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is increasingly dependent on corpus-based methods.

Execution Monitoring of High-Level Robot Programs. Imagine a robot that is executing a program  on-line, and, insofar as it is reasonable to do  so, it wishes to continue with this on-line  program execution, no matter what exogenous  events occur in the world. Execution  monitoring is the robot's process of observing  the world for discrepancies between the  actual world and its internal representation  of it, and recovering from such discrepancies.  We provide a situation calculus-based account  of such on-line program executions,  with monitoring. This account relies on a  specification for a single-step interpreter for  the logic programming language Golog . The  theory is supported by an implementation  that is illustrated by a standard blocks world  in which a robot is executing a Golog program  to build a suitable tower. The monitor  makes use of a simple kind of planner for  recovering from malicious exogenous actions  performed by another agent. After performing  the sequence of actions generated by the  recovery procedure, th...

Discovering Informative Content Blocks from Web Documents In this paper, we propose a new approach to discover informative contents from a set of tabular documents (or Web pages) of a Web site. Our system, InfoDiscoverer, first partitions a page into several content blocks according to HTML tag <TABLE> in a Web page. Based on the occurrence of the features (terms) in the set of pages, it calculates entropy value of each feature. According to the entropy value of each feature in a content block, the entropy value of the block is defined. By analyzing the information measure, we propose a method to dynamically select the entropy-threshold that partitions blocks into either informative or redundant. Informative content blocks are distinguished parts of the page, whereas redundant content blocks are common parts. Based on the answer set generated from 13 manually tagged news Web sites with a total of 26,518 Web pages, experiments show that both recall and precision rates are greater than 0.956. That is, using the approach, informative blocks (news articles) of these sites can be automatically separated from semantically redundant contents such as advertisements, banners, navigation panels, news categories, etc. By adopting InfoDiscoverer as the preprocessor of information retrieval and extraction applications, the retrieval and extracting precision will be increased, and the indexing size and extracting complexity will also be reduced.

The Diagnosis Frontend of the dlv System This paper presents the Diagnosis Frontend of dlv, which is a knowledge representation system under development at the Technische Universit√§t Wien. The kernel language of the system is an extension of disjunctive logic programming (DLP) by integrity constraints; it offers frontends to several advanced knowledge representation formalisms. The formal model of diagnosis employed in the frontend includes both abductive diagnosis (over DLP theories) and consistency-based diagnosis. For each of the two diagnosis modalities, generic diagnoses, single error diagnoses, and subset minimal diagnoses are considered. We illustrate the use of the frontend by showing the dlv encodings of several diagnosis problems. Thereafter, we discuss implementation issues. Diagnostic reasoning is implemented on the dlv engine through suitable translations of diagnostic problems into disjunctive logic programs, such that their stable models correspond to diagnoses. For the six kinds of diagnostic reasoning problems emerging from above, such reductions are provided

Integrating Case Based Reasoning and Tabu Search for Solving Optimisation Problems Tabu search is an established heuristic optimisation technique for problems where exact algorithms are not available. It belongs to the same family as simulated annealing or genetic algorithms. It extends the basic iterative improvement scheme by adding control learning. A technique of this kind, intensification, captures experience established on a frequency-based analysis of past search. Experience is reused while the same optimisation process is going on in order to guide search to better solutions.  In this paper, we introduce a case-based reasoning approach for control learning in tabu search. Search experience concerns operator selection and is represented by cases. The aim of case reuse is to improve conflict resolution. While the proposed method is domain independent, we present its application to the NPhard uncapacitated facility location problem. Experimental results show that adding our approach to a basic tabu search optimisation significantly improves solution quality on t...

Representing and Querying XML with Incomplete Information We study the representation and querying of XML with incomplete information. We consider a simple model for XML data and their DTDs, a very simple query language, and a representation system for incomplete information in the spirit of the representations systems developed by Imielinski and Lipski for relational databases. In the scenario we consider, the incomplete information about an XML document is continuously enriched by successive queries to the document. We show that our representation system can represent partial information about the source document acquired by successive queries,  and that it can be used to intelligently answer new queries.  We also consider the impact on complexity of enriching our representation system or query language with additional features. The results suggest that our approach achieves a practically appealing balance between expressiveness and tractability. The research presented here was motivated by the Xyleme project at INRIA, whose objectiveittodevelop a data warehouse for Web XML documents.  1.

Feature Extraction and Learning Vector Quantization for Data Structures During the last years, folding architecture networks and the closely related concept of recursive neural networks have been developed for solving supervised learning tasks on data structures.

Furthermore, a new method for supervised learning for data structures which combines ideas from learning vector quantization and folding architecture networks is suggested. 1 Introduction  In almost all fields of scientific and technical reasoning, people and systems assisting them have to deal with structured objects .

Patterns in Property Specifications for Finite-State Verification Model checkers and other finite-state verification tools allow developers to detect certain kinds of errors automatically. Nevertheless, the transition of this technology from research to practice has been slow. While there are a number of potential causes for reluctance to adopt such formal methods, we believe that a primary cause is that practitioners are unfamiliar with specification processes, notations, and strategies. In a recent paper, we proposed a pattern-based approach to the presentation, codification and reuse of property specifications for finite-state verification. Since then, we have carried out a survey of available specifications, collecting over 500 examples of property specifications. We found that most are instances of our proposed patterns. Furthermore, we have updated our pattern system to accommodate new patterns and variations of existing patterns encountered in this survey.

Second Order Sufficient Conditions for Optimal Control Problems with Free Final Time: The Riccati Approach . Second order sufficient conditions (SSC) for control problems with control--state constraints and free final time are presented. Instead of deriving such SSC de initio, the control problem with free final time is tranformed into an augmented control problem with fixed final time for which well-known SSC exist. SSC are then expressed as a condition on the positive definiteness of the second variation. A convenient numerical tool for verifying this condition is based on the Riccati approach where one has to find a bounded solution of an associated Riccati equation satisfying specific boundary conditions. The augmented Riccati equations for the augmented control problem are derived and their modifications on the boundary of the control--state constraint are discussed. Two numerical examples, (1) the classical Earth-Mars orbit transfer in minimal time, (2) the Rayleigh problem in electrical engineering, demonstrate that the Riccati equation approach provides a viable numerical test of SS...

Mining Optimized Support Rules for Numeric Attributes Mining association rules on large data sets has received considerable attention in recent years. Association rules are useful for determining correlations between attributes of a relation and have applications in marketing, financial and retail sectors. Furthermore, optimized association rules  are an effective way to focus on the most interesting characteristics involving certain attributes. Optimized association rules are permitted to contain uninstantiated attributes and the problem is to determine instantiations such that either the support, confidence or gain of the rule is maximized. In this paper, we generalize the optimized support association rule problem by permitting rules to contain disjunctions over uninstantiated numeric attributes. Our generalized association rules enable us to extract more useful information about seasonal and local patterns involving the uninstantiated attribute.

WSQ/DSQ: A Practical Approach for Combined Querying of Databases and the Web www-db.stanford.edu We present WSQ/DSQ (pronounced ‚Äúwisk-disk‚Äù), a new approach for combining the query facilities of traditional databases with existing search engines on the Web. WSQ, for Web-Supported (Database) Queries, leverages results from Web searches to enhance SQL queries over a relational database. DSQ, for Database-Supported (Web) Queries, uses information stored in the database to enhance and explain Web searches. This paper focuses primarily on WSQ, describing a simple, low-overhead way to support WSQ in a relational DBMS, and demonstrating the utility of WSQ with a number of interesting queries and results. The queries supported by WSQ are enabled by two virtual tables, whose tuples represent Web search results generated dynamically during query execution. WSQ query execution may involve many high-latency calls to one or more search engines, during which the query processor is idle. We present a lightweight technique called asynchronous iteration that can be integrated easily into a standard sequential query processor to enable concurrency between query processing and multiple Web search requests. Asynchronous iteration has broader applications than WSQ alone, and it opens up many interesting query optimization issues. We have developed a prototype implementation of WSQ by extending a DBMS with virtual tables and asynchronous iteration; performance results are reported. 1

Evolving Swimming Controllers for a Simulated Lamprey With Inspiration From Neurobiology This paper presents how neural swimming controllers for a simulated lamprey can be developed using evolutionary algorithms. A Genetic Algorithm is used for evolving the architecture of a connectionist model which determines the muscular activity of a simulated body. This work is inspired by the biological model developed by Ekeberg which reproduces the Central Pattern Generator observed in the real lamprey [Ekeberg 93]. In evolving artificial controllers, we demonstrate that a Genetic Algorithm can be an interesting design technique for neural controllers and that there exist alternative solutions to the biological connectivity. A variety of neural controllers are evolved which can produce the pattern of oscillations necessary for swimming. These patterns can be modulated through the external excitation applied to the network in order to vary the speed and the direction of swimming.

Human factors in ATC alarms and notifications design: an experimental evaluation With the growing use of computerised working position, alarm design on air traffic control displays is a concern as events to be notified increase in number and diversity. Safety requires visual notifications that can be efficiently detected and understood. It also requires that no information on the radar display is obscured by the visual notifications. We also need to design hierarchies of notifications, from most severe to benign. Taking advantage of the current graphical capabilities of computers, we have identified and explored various dimensions in visual alarm design. We present in this paper an experimental evaluation, in terms of detection time and precision, of several of those dimensions: opacity, size, temporal profile of animation and signal frequency. From our results, we conclude that opacity, size and temporal profile of animation are well suited to introduce some nuances in the way we convey notifications on visual displays. We also show that detection of a given signa...

Integrating Keyword Search into XML Query Processing Due to the popularity of the XML data format, several query languages for XML have been proposed, specially devised to handle data whose structure is unknown, loose, or absent. While these languages are rich enough to allow for querying the content and structure of an XML document, a varying or unknown structure can make formulating queries a very difficult task. We propose an extension to XML query languages that enables keyword search at the granularity of XML elements, that helps novice users formulate queries, and also yields new optimization opportunities for the query processor. We present an implementation of this extension on top of a commercial RDBMS; we then discuss implementation choices and performance results.  Keywords  XML query processing, full-text index  1 Introduction  There is no doubt that XML is rapidly becoming one of the most important data formats. It is already used for scientific data (e.g., DNA sequences), in linguistics (e.g., the Treebank database at the U...

Methods for Sampling Pages Uniformly from the World Wide Web We present two new algorithms for generating uniformly  random samples of pages from the World Wide Web, building  upon recent work by Henzinger et al. (Henzinger et al.  2000) and Bar-Yossef et al. (Bar-Yossef et al. 2000). Both  algorithms are based on a weighted random-walk methodology.  The first algorithm (DIRECTED-SAMPLE) operates  on arbitrary directed graphs, and so is naturally applicable  to the web. We show that, in the limit, this algorithm  generates samples that are uniformly random. The second  algorithm (UNDIRECTED-SAMPLE) operates on undirected  graphs, thus requiring a mechanism for obtaining inbound  links to web pages (e.g., access to a search engine). With  this additional knowledge of inbound links, the algorithm  can arrive at a uniform distribution faster than DIRECTEDSAMPLE,  and we derive explicit bounds on the time to convergence.  In addition, we evaluate the two algorithms on  simulated web data, showing that both yield reliably uniform  samples of pages. We also compare our results with those of  previous algorithms, and discuss the theoretical relationships  among the various proposed methods.

Gradient-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradientbased learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of two dimensional (2-D) shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation, recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN‚Äôs), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank check is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal checks. It is deployed commercially and reads several million checks per day.

On the Emergence of Macro Spatial Structures in Dissipative Cellular Automata, and its Implications for Agent-based Distributed Computing This paper describes the peculiar behavior observed in a class of cellular automata that we have defined as "dissipative", i.e., cellular automata that are "open" and makes it possible for the environment to influence the evolution of the automata. Peculiar in the dynamic evolution of this class of cellular automata is that stable macro-level spatial structures emerge from local interactions among cells, a behavior that does not emerge when the cellular automaton is "closed", i.e., when the state of a cell is not influenced by the external world. On this basis, the paper discusses the relations of the performed experiments with the area of open distributed computing, and in particular of agent-based distributed computing. The basic intuition is that dissipative cellular automata express characteristics that strongly resembles those of wide-area open distributed systems based on autonomous and situated active components -- as agents are. Accordingly, similar sorts of macrolevel behaviors are likely to emerge and need to be studied, controlled, and possibly fruitfully exploited.

Robust Classification Systems for Imprecise Environments In real-world environments it is usually difficult to specify target operating conditions precisely. This uncertainty makes building robust classification systems problematic. We show that it is possible to build a hybrid classifier that will perform at least as well as the best available classifier for any target conditions. This robust performance extends across a wide variety of comparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy, expected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. In some cases, the performance of the hybrid can actually surpass that of the best known classifier. The hybrid is also efficient to build, to store, and to update. Finally, we provide empirical evidence that a robust hybrid classifier is needed for many real-world problems. Introduction  Traditionally, classification systems have been built by experimenting with many different classifiers, comparing their performance and choosing the classifier that performs best....

Intelligent Retrieval Of Digital Images From Large Geospatial Databases In this paper we present the development of a spatial data management system utilizing sketch-based queries for the content-based retrieval of digital images from topographic databases. We discuss our overall strategy and associated algorithmic and implementational aspects, and present the associated database design issues. The query tools devised in this research are employing user-provided sketches of the shape and spatial configuration of the object(s) which should appear in the images to be retrieved. Our strategy is scaleindependent. It is inspired by least-squares matching (lsm), and represents an extension of lsm to function with a variety of raster representations. The results are ranked according to statistical scores and the user can subsequently narrow or broaden his/her search according to the previously obtained results and the purpose of the search. 1 INTRODUCTION  Intelligent image retrieval from large databases is one of the novel applications which are receiving increa...

Containment of Conjunctive Regular Path Queries with Inverse Reasoning on queries is a basic problem both in knowledge representation and databases. A fundamental form of reasoning on queries is checking containment, i.e., verifying whether one query yields necessarily a subset of the result of another query. Query containment is crucial in several contexts, such as query optimization, knowledge base verification, information integration, database integrity checking, and cooperative answering. In this paper we address the problem of query containment in the context of semistructured knowledge bases, where the basic querying mechanism, namely regular path queries, asks for all pairs of objects that are connected by a path conforming to a regular expression. We consider conjunctive regular path queries with inverse, which extend regular path queries with the possibility of using both the inverse of binary relations, and conjunctions of atoms, where each atom specifies that one regular path query with inverse holds between two v...

Flexible Distributed Database Management with AgentTeam . Ideally, distributed management of relational data should enable the sharing of consistent data and provide system transparency. In contrast to information retrieval, users can access compact data and utilise it for further relational processing. However, distributed database management is still a challenging research area that involves bridging syntactic and semantic heterogeneity of data as well as of functionality. Since, existing distributed database management systems were usually built with a focus on the implementation of some dedicated protocols for distributed database management, they are inflexible for major modifications or exchange of the protocols. In addition, their software architecture usually does not comply with well-known design paradigms, which could facilitate the maintenance of the software system. We present an agent-based approach for flexible distributed database management, where independent distributed database management protocols and methods are...

Modeling Temporal Consistency in Data Warehouses Real-world changes are generally discovered delayed by computer systems. The typical update patterns for traditional data warehouses on an overnight or even weekly basis enlarge this propagation delay until the information is available to knowledge workers. The main contribution of the paper is the identification of two different temporal characterizations of the information appearing in a data warehouse: one is the classical description of the time instant when a given fact occurred, the other represents the instant when the information has been entered into the system. We present an approach for modeling conceptual time consistency problems and introduce a data model that deals with timely delays and supports knowledge workers to determine what the situation was in the past, knowing only the information available at a given instant of time. 1

Layout Rules for Graphical Web Documents The number of companies, institutions, and individuals competing for attention in the World-Wide Web is growing exponentially. This makes designing informative, easy-to-grasp, and visually appealing documents not only important for userfriendly information presentation, but also the key to success for any information provider. In this paper, we present layout guidelines for textual and graphical, static and dynamic, 2-D and 3-D Web documents which are drawn from fields as diverse as typography, Gestalt psychology, architecture, hypertext authoring, and human-computer interaction. Web documents are classified into five basic types, and our layout rules are applied to each of these.

Implementing Incremental Code Migration with XML We demonstrate how XML and related technologies can be used for code mobility at any granularity, thus overcoming the restrictions of existing approaches. By not fixing a particular granularity for mobile code, we enable complete programs as well as individual lines of code to be sent across the network. We define the concept of incremental code mobility as the ability to migrate and add, remove, or replace code fragments (i.e., increments) in a remote program. The combination of fine-grained and incremental migration achieves a previously unavailable degree of flexibility. We examine the application of incremental and fine-grained code migration to a variety of domains, including user interface management, application management on mobile thin clients, for example PDAs, and management of distributed documents.

Foundations for Bayesian networks Bayesian networks are normally given one of two types of foundations: they are either treated purely formally as an abstract way of representing probability functions, or they are interpreted, with some causal interpretation given to the graph in a network and some standard interpretation of probability given to the probabilities specified in the network. In this chapter I argue that current foundations are problematic, and put forward new foundations which involve aspects of both the interpreted and the formal approaches. One standard approach is to interpret a Bayesian network objectively: the graph in a Bayesian network represents causality in the world and the specified probabilities are objective, empirical probabilities. Such an interpretation founders when the Bayesian network independence assumption (often called the causal Markov condition) fails to hold. In ¬ß2 I catalogue the occasions when the independence assumption fails, and show that such failures are pervasive. Next, in ¬ß3, I show that even where the independence assumption does hold objectively, an agent‚Äôs causal knowledge is unlikely to satisfy the assumption with respect to her subjective probabilities, and that slight differences between an agent‚Äôs subjective Bayesian network and an objective Bayesian network can lead to large differences between probability distributions determined by these networks. To overcome these difficulties I put forward logical Bayesian foundations in ¬ß5. I show that if the graph and probability specification in a Bayesian network are thought of as an agent‚Äôs background knowledge, then the agent is most rational if she adopts the probability distribution determined by the

How to Avoid Knowing It All Beliefs have been formally modelled in the last decades using doxastic logics. The possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they seem to commit us to model agents that are logically omniscient (they believe every classical tautology) and perfect reasoners (their beliefs are closed under classical deductive closure). Thus, this model would not be appropriate to model non-ideal agents, that have resource limitations that prevent them from attaining such levels of doxastic competence.

Data Mining Models as Services on the Internet The goal of this article is to raise a debate on the usefulness of providing data mining models as services on the internet. These services can be provided by anyone with adequate data and expertise and made available on the internet for anyone to use. For instance, Yahoo or Altavista, given their huge categorized document collection, can train a document classifier and provide the model as a service on the internet. This way data mining can be made accessible to a wider audience instead of being limited to people with the data and the expertise. A host of practical problems need to be solved before this idea can be made to work. We identify them and close with an invitation for further debate and investigation.  1.

Management and Query Processing of one dimensional Intervals with the UB-Tree The management and query processing of one dimensional intervals is a special case of extended object handling. One dimensional intervals play an important role in temporal databases and they can also be used for fuzzy matching, fuzzy logic and measuring quality classes, etc. Most existing multidimensional access methods for extended objects do not address this special problem and most of them are main memory access methods that do not support e#cient access to secondary storage.  The research in the application of the UB-Tree to extended objects is part of my doctoral work.

Defining Views In An Image Database System : A view mechanism can help handle the complex semantics in emerging  application areas such as image databases. This paper presents the view  mechanism we defined for the DISIMA image database system. Since DISIMA is  being developed on top of an object-oriented database system, we first propose  apowerful object-oriented view mechanism based on the separation between  types (interface functions) and classes that manage objects of the same type.  The image view mechanism uses our object-oriented view mechanism to allow  us to give differentsemantics to the same image. The solution is based on the  distinction between physical salient objects which are interesting objects in an  image and logical salient objects which are the meanings of these objects.  14.1 INTRODUCTION  Views have been widely used in relational database management systems to extend modeling capabilities and to provide data independence.

Furthermore, the relationships between topics is mapped out in order to build a predictive model of link content. Among the many applications of this approach are information retrieval and search, topic identification, query disambiguation, focused web crawling, web authoring, and bibliometric analysis.

MIND: An architecture for multimedia information retrieval in federated digital libraries Introduction  Today, people have routine access to a huge number of heterogeneous and distributed digital libraries. To satisfy an information need, relevant libraries have to be selected, the information need has to be reformulated for every library w. r. t. its schema and query syntax, and the results have to be fused. This is an ineffective manual task for which accurate tools are desirable.  MIND (which we are currently developing in an EU project) is an end-to-end solution for federated digital libraries which covers all these issues. We start from information retrieval approaches which focus on retrieval quality, but mostly only consider monomedial and homogeneous sources. We will extend these approaches for dealing with different kinds of media (text, facts, images and transcripts of speech recognition) as well as handling heterogeneous libraries (e.g., with different schemas). Another innovation is that MIND also considers non-co-operating libraries which only provide the

Multi-Robot Target Acquisition using Multiple Objective Behavior Coordination In this paper we propose an approach to multi-robot coordination in the context of cooperative target acquisition. The approach is based on multiple objective behavior coordination extended to multiple robots. It provides mechanisms for distributed command fusion across a group of robots to pursue multiple goals of multiple robots in parallel. The mechanisms enable each robot to select actions that not only benefit itself but also benefit the group as a whole. Experimental results with two mobile robots validate that, by using this method, a group of robots can successfully track and acquire a moving target. 1 Introduction Cooperation of a team of robots in unknown settings poses complex control problems which require solutions that guarantee a suitable trade-off between a multitude of (potentially) conflicting task objectives within and among the robots. For instance, an action that is optimal with respect to a particular robot might be unacceptable with respect to the others. Thus ...

Mixtures of Linear Subspaces for Face Detection We present two methods using mixtures of linear subspaces for face detection in gray level images. One method uses a mixture of factor analyzers to concurrently perform clustering and, within each cluster, perform local dimensionality reduction. The parameters of the mixture model are estimated using an EM algorithm. A face is detected if the probability of an input sample is above a predened threshold. The other mixture of subspaces method uses Kohonen 's self-organizing map for clustering and Fisher Linear Discriminant to nd an optimal projection and a Gaussian distribution to model the class-conditional density function of the projected samples for each class.

Curio: A Novel Solution for Efficient Storage and Indexing in Data Warehouses Efficient query processing is a critical requirement for data warehousing systems as decision support applications often require interactive response times to answer complex, ad-hoc queries (e.g., aggregations, multi-way joins) over vast repositories of data (e.g., hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes in size). The most common approach used to improve On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) query performance is to utilize indexes or access structures to quickly access the base data. A major drawback to this approach is that it often incurs significant overhead as the access structures must be stored in addition to the base data.

In this paper, we argue that embodiment can serve an even stronger function if system designers use actual human conversational protocols in the design of the interface. Communicative behaviors such as salutations and farewells, conversational turn-taking with interruptions, and referring to objects using pointing gestures are examples of protocols that all native speakers of a language already know how to perform and that can thus be leveraged in an intelligent interface. We discuss how these protocols are integrated into Rea, an embodied, multi-modal conversational interface agent who acts as a real-estate salesperson, and we show why embodiment is required for their successful implementation.

The effectiveness of the approach proposed is evaluated on a standard benchmark for prediction models, the Mackey--Glass series. 1.

Increasing the Expressiveness of Analytical Performance Models for Replicated Databases . The vast number of design options in replicated databases requires efficient analytical performance evaluations so that the considerable overhead of simulations or measurements can be focused on a few promising options. A review of existing analytical models in terms of their modeling assumptions, replication schemata considered, and network properties captured, shows that data replication and intersite communication as well as workload patterns should be modeled more accurately. Based on this analysis, we define a new modeling approach named 2RC (2-dimensional replication model with integrated communication). We derive a complete analytical queueing model for 2RC and demonstrate that it is of higher expressiveness than existing models. 2RC also yields a novel bottleneck analysis and permits to evaluate the trade-off between throughput and availability. 1 Introduction  Replication management in distributed databases concerns the decision when and where to allocate physical copies of ...

Autonomous Helicopter Control using Reinforcement Learning Policy Search Methods Many control problems in the robotics field can be cast as Partially Observed Markovian Decision Problems (POMDPs), an optimal control formalism. Finding optimal solutions to such problems in general, however is known to be intractable. It has often been observed that in practice, simple structured controllers suffice for good sub-optimal control, and recent research in the artificial intelligence community has focused on policy search methods as techniques for finding sub-optimal controllers when such structured controllers do exist. Traditional model-based reinforcement learning algorithms make a certainty equivalence assumption on their learned models and calculate optimal policies for a maximumlikelihood Markovian model. In this work, we consider algorithms that evaluate and synthesize controllers under distributions of Markovian models.

Distributed control of a team of mobile robots presents a number of unique challenges, including highly unreliable communication, real world task and safety constraints, scalability, dynamic reconfigurability, heterogenous platforms, and a lack of standardized tools or techniques.

Query Rewriting for Semistructured Data We address the problem of query rewriting for TSL, a language for querying semistructured data. We develop and present an algorithm that, given a semistructured query q and a set of semistructured views V, finds rewriting queries, i.e., queries that access the views and produce the same result as q.  Our algorithm is based on appropriately generalizing containment mappings, the chase, and unification  -- techniques that were developed for structured, relational data. We also develop an algorithm for equivalence checking of TSL queries. We show that the algorithm is sound and complete for TSL, i.e., it always finds every TSL rewriting query of q, and we discuss its complexity. We extend the rewriting algorithm to use available structural constraints (such as DTDs) to find more opportunities for query rewriting. We currently incorporate the algorithm in the TSIMMIS system. 1 Introduction  Recently, many semistructured data models, query and view definition languages have been proposed [2...

The development of the underlying concepts has been driven by investigations in certain problems of case-based learning. Therefore, the present development of the target concepts is accompanied by an in-depth discussion of related learning problems. Logical case memory systems provide some formal framework for the investigation and for the application of structural similarity concepts. Those concepts have some crucial advantage over traditional numerical similarity concepts: The result of determining a new case's similarity to some formerly experienced case can be directly taken as a basis for performing case adaptation.

Our approach deforms a prototype mesh containing vector-based delineated muscles to fit one or more geometric models obtained from stereo image pairs of a specific person's head. The resulting personalized mesh facilitates animation with the same realism and predictability as the original prototype mesh. The model construction requires some manual interaction, however automatic refinement methods reduce the need for precision. The sensing process is passive and no physical markers are needed on the person's face. Models produced by our method are suited to realistic animations of specific individuals for applications in special effects, games, and 3D teleconferencing.  1. Introduction  Ever since the pioneering work of Frederic I. Parke [1] in 1972, researchers have attempted to generate realistic facial models and animation. Recent inte...

Learning Hierarchical Task Models by Defining and Refining Examples Task models are used in many areas of computer science including planning, intelligent tutoring, plan recognition, interface design, and decision theory. However, developing task models is a significant practical challenge. We present a task model development environment centered around a machine learning engine that infers task models from examples. A novel aspect of the environment is support for a domain expert to refine past examples as he or she develops a clearer understanding of how to model the domain. Collectively, these examples constitute a "test suite" that the development environment manages in order to verify that manual changes to the evolving task model do not have unintended consequences. 1.

Vector-Based Natural Language Call Routing This paper describes a domain independent, automatically trained natural language call router for directing incoming calls in a call center. Our call router directs customer calls based on their response to an open-ended "How may I direct your call?" prompt. Routing behavior is trained from a corpus of transcribed and hand-routed calls and then carried out using vectorbased information retrieval techniques. Terms consist of n-gram sequences of morphologically reduced content words, while documents representing routing destinations consists of weighted term frequencies derived from calls to that destination in the training corpus. Based on the statistical discriminating power of the n-gram terms extracted from the caller's request, the caller is 1) routed to the appropriate destination, 2) transferred to a human operator, or 3) asked a disambiguation question. In the last case, the system dynamically generates queries tailored to the caller's request and the destinations with which it is consistent, based on our extension of the vector model. Evaluation of the call router performance over a financial services call center using both accurate transcriptions of calls and fairly noisy speech recognizer output demonstrated robustness in the face of speech recognition errors. Furthermore, our system showed a substantial improvement in performance over existing systems by correctly routing 93.8% of the calls after punting 10.2% of all calls to a human operator on transcription, with approximately 4% degradation in performance when using speech recognizer output with a 23% word error rate.

Glove-TalkII: A neural network interface which maps gestures to parallel formant speech synthesizer controls Glove-TalkII is a system which translates hand gestures to speech through an adaptive interface. Hand gestures are mapped continuously to 10 control parameters of a parallel formant speech synthesizer. The mapping allows the hand to act as an artificial vocal tract that produces speech in real time. This gives an unlimited vocabulary in addition to direct control of fundamental frequency and volume. Currently, the best version of GloveTalkII uses several input devices (including a Cyberglove, a ContactGlove, a 3-space tracker, and a foot-pedal), a parallel formant speech synthesizer and 3 neural networks. The gesture-to-speech task is divided into vowel and consonant production by using a gating network to weight the outputs of a vowel and a consonant neural network. The gating network and the consonant network are trained with examples from the user. The vowel network implements a fixed, user-defined relationship between hand-position and vowel sound and does not require any training ...

Active Rule Analysis And Optimisation In The Rock & Roll Deductive Object-Oriented Database Active database systems provide facilities that monitor and respond to changes of  relevance to the database. Active behaviour is normally described using Event Condition Action rules  (ECA-rules), and a number of systems have been developed, based upon different data models, that  support such rules. However, experience using active databases shows that while such systems are  powerful and potentially useful in many applications, they are hard to program and liable to exhibit  poor performance at runtime. This document addresses both of these issues by examining both analysis  and optimisation of active rules in the context of a powerful active database system. It is shown how  rule analysis methods developed for straightforward active rule languages for relational data models  can be extended to take account of rich event description languages and more powerful execution  models. It is also shown how the results of analyses can be exploited by rule optimisers, and that  multiple quer...

Towards a Highly-Scalable and Effective Metasearch Engine A metasearch engine is a system that supports unified access to multiple local search engines. Database selection is one of the main challenges in building a large-scale metasearch engine. The problem is to efficiently and accurately determine a small number of potentially useful local search engines to invoke for each user query. In order to enable accurate selection, metadata that reect the contents of each search engine need to be collected and used. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable and accurate database selection method. This method has several novel features. First, the metadata for representing the contents of all search engines are organized into a single integrated representative. Such a representative yields both computation efficiency and storage efficiency. Second, our selection method is based on a theory for ranking search engines optimally. Experimental results indicate that this new method is very effective. An operational prototype system has been built based on the proposed approach.

Word Sense Disambiguation And Its Application To Internet Search ambiguation method presented here is that it provides a ranking of possible associations between words senses, rather than a binary yes/no decision for a possible sense combination. This proves to be particularly useful for Natural Language Processing tasks such as retrieving information related to a particular input question. An important task which can highly benet from a Word Sense Disambiguation method is the Internet search. This thesis presents a possible application of Word Sense Disambiguation techniques for improving the quality of the search on the Internet. Knowing the sense of the words in the input question enables the creation of similarity lists which contain words semantically related to the original keywords, and which can be further used for query extension. The extended query, together with the new lexical operators dened for information extraction, improve both the  precision and the resolution of a search on the Internet. iv  Speci

One approach to manage  such relationships consists of using an explicit representation of them, allowing  each agent to choose its actions based on them. Previous work in the area have  considered ideal situations, such as fully known environments, static relationships  and shared mental states. In this paper we propose to represent relationships  among agents and entities in a multi-agent system by using influence diagrams.

A Simple Neural Network Models Categorical Perception of Facial Expressions The performance of a neural network that categorizes facial expressions is compared with human subjects over a set of experiments using interpolated imagery. The experiments for both the human subjects and neural networks make use of interpolations of facial expressions from the Pictures of Facial Affect Database [Ekman and Friesen, 1976]. The only difference in materials between those used in the human subjects experiments [Young et al., 1997] and our materials are the manner in which the interpolated images are constructed -- image-quality morphs versus pixel averages. Nevertheless, the neural network accurately captures the categorical nature of the human responses, showing sharp transitions in labeling of images along the interpolated sequence. Crucially for a demonstration of categorical perception [Harnad, 1987], the model shows the highest discrimination between transition images at the crossover point. The model also captures the shape of the reaction time curves of the human s...

To make querying easy, visual query languages have been proposed. Most of these languages have a low expressive power and have their own query processors. Efforts have been made to design query languages with proper semantics to facilitate query optimization and processing in existing database systems. The majority of multimedia database systems are built on top of object or object-relational database systems with the underlying query facilities inherited. The DISIMA system is being built on top of a commercial OODBMS and we have chosen to extend the standard object-oriented query language OQL with some multimedia functionalities.

Concept Hierarchy Based Text Database Categorization Document categorization as a technique to improve the retrieval of useful documents has been extensively investigated. One important issue in a large-scale metasearch engine is to select text databases that are likely to contain useful documents for a given query. We believe that database categorization can be a potentially effective technique for good database selection, especially in the Internet environment where short queries are usually submitted. In this paper, we propose and evaluate several database categorization algorithms. This study indicates that while some document categorization algorithms could be adopted for database categorization, algorithms that take into consideration the special characteristics of databases may be more effective. Preliminary experimental results are provided to compare the proposed database categorization algorithms. A prototype database categorization system based on one of the proposed algorithms has been developed.

An analysis of WebWho: How does awareness of presence affect written messages? We present preliminary results from a study of how awareness of presence affects instant messaging in a computer lab. The easily accessible web based awareness tool, WebWho, visualizes a large university computer lab, allowing students to virtually locate one another and communicate via an instant messaging system. Messages can be sent anonymously, by a conscious act of ticking a box. Cross analyses of sender location (collocated, distributed, and distant), sender status (anonymous vs. identified) and message content were made. Results show that awareness of both physical presence and virtual presence affect the messages, and that these factors affect the text differently.

We propose that this new science should be grounded, theoretically on a richer conception of sociality, and methodologically on the extensive use of computational modelling for real-world applications and social simulations. Here, the steps we set forth towards meeting that challenge are mainly theoretical. In this respect, we provide a new model of multi-agent systems that reflects a fully explicated conception of cognition, both at the individual and the collective level. Finally, the mechanisms and principles underpinning the model will be examined with particular emphasis on the contributions provided by contemporary organisation theory.  1.

Shaping a CBR view with XML . Case Based Reasoning has found increasing application on the  Internet as an assistant in Internet commerce stores and as a reasoning agent for  online technical support. The strength of CBR in this area stems from its reuse  of the knowledge base associated with a particular application, thus providing  an ideal way to make personalised configuration or technical information  available to the Internet user. Since case data may be one aspect of a company's  entire corporate knowledge system, it is important to integrate case data easily  within a company's IT infrastructure, using industry specific vocabulary.

Kernel Expansions With Unlabeled Examples Modern classification applications necessitate supplementing the few available labeled examples with unlabeled examples to improve classification performance. We present a new tractable algorithm for exploiting unlabeled examples in discriminative classification. This is achieved essentially by expanding the input vectors into longer feature vectors via both labeled and unlabeled examples. The resulting classification method can be interpreted as a discriminative kernel density estimate and is readily trained via the EM algorithm, which in this case is both discriminative and achieves the optimal solution. We provide, in addition, a purely discriminative formulation of the estimation problem by appealing to the maximum entropy framework. We demonstrate that the proposed approach requires very few labeled examples for high classification accuracy. 1 Introduction In many modern classification problems such as text categorization, very few labeled examples are available but a...

Managing Intervals Efficiently in Object-Relational Databases Modern database applications show a growing demand  for efficient and dynamic management of intervals,  particularly for temporal and spatial data  or for constraint handling. Common approaches  require the augmentation of index structures  which, however, is not supported by existing relational  database systems. By design, the new Relational  Interval Tree  1  (RI-tree) employs built-in  indexes on an as-they-are basis and is easy to implement.  Whereas the functionality and efficiency  of the RI-tree is supported by any off-the-shelf relational  DBMS, it is perfectly encapsulated by the  object-relational data model.  The RI-tree requires O(n/b) disk blocks of size b to  store n intervals, O(log b n) I/O operations for insertion  or deletion, and O(h log b n + r/b) I/Os for an  intersection query producing r results.

Error-Correcting Output Coding for Text Classification This paper applies error-correcting output coding (ECOC) to the task of document categorization. ECOC, of recent vintage in the AI literature, is a method for decomposing a multiway classification problem into many binary classification tasks, and then combining the results of the subtasks into a hypothesized solution to the original problem. There has been much recent interest in the machine learning community about algorithms which integrate "advice" from many subordinate predictors into a single classifier, and error-correcting output coding is one such technique. We provide experimental results on several real-world datasets, extracted from the Internet, which demonstrate that ECOC can offer significant improvements in accuracy over conventional classification algorithms. 1 Introduction Error-correcting output coding is a recipe for solving multi-way classification problems.

Scalable Feature Selection, Classification and Signature Generation for Organizing Large Text Databases Into Hierarchical Topic Taxonomies   We explore how to organize large text databases hierarchically by topic to aid better searching, browsing and filtering. Many corpora, such as internet directories, digital libraries, and patent databases are manually organized into topic hierarchies, also called taxonomies. Similar to indices for relational data, taxonomies make search and access more efficient. However, the exponential growth in the volume of on-line textual information makes it nearly impossible to maintain such taxonomic organization for large, fast-changing corpora by hand.  We describe an automatic system that starts with a small sample of the corpus in which topics have been assigned by hand, and then updates the database with new documents as the corpus grows, assigning topics to these new documents with high speed and accuracy.  To do this, we use techniques from statistical pattern recognition to efficiently separate the feature words, or discriminants, from the noise words at each node of the taxonomy. Usi...

Three Ways to Grow Designs: A Comparison of Evolved Embryogenies for a Design Problem This paper explores the use of growth processes, or embryogenies, to map genotypes to phenotypes within evolutionary systems. Following a summary of the significant features of embryogenies, the three main types of embryogenies in Evolutionary Computation are then identified and explained: external, explicit and implicit. An experimental comparison between these three different embryogenies and an evolutionary algorithm with no embryogeny is performed. The problem set to the four evolutionary systems is to evolve tessellating tiles. In order to assess the scalability of the embryogenies, the problem is increased in difficulty by enlarging the size of tiles to be evolved. The results are surprising, with the implicit embryogeny outperforming all other techniques by showing no significant increase in the size of the genotypes or decrease in accuracy of evolution as the scale of the problem is increased. 1.

DrawCAD: Using Deductive Object-Relational Databases in CAD Computer-Aided Design (CAD) involves the use of computers in the various stages of engineering design. It has large volumes of data with complex structures that needs to be stored and managed efficiently and properly. In CAD, graphical objects with complex structures can be created by reusing previously created objects. The data of these objects have the references to the other objects they contain. Deductive object-relational databases can be used to compute the complete data of graphical objects that reuse other objects. This is the idea behind the development of the DrawCAD system. DrawCAD is a CAD system built on top of the Relationlog object-relational deductive database system. It facilitates the creation of graphical objects by reusing previously created objects. The DrawCAD system illustrates how CAD systems can be developed, using deductive object-relational databases to store and manage data and also perform the computations that are normally performed by the application program.

Minimization in Cooperative Response to Failing Database Queries When a query fails, it is more cooperative to identify the cause of failure, rather than just to report the empty answer set. If there is not a cause for the query's failure, it is worthwhile to report the part of the query which failed. To identify a minimal failing subquery (MFS) of the query is the best way to do this. (This MFS is not unique; there may be many of them.) Likewise, to identify a maximal succeeding subquery (MSS) can help a user to recast a new query that leads to a non-empty answer set. Database systems do not provide the functionality of these types of cooperative responses. This may be, in part, because algorithmic approaches to finding the MFSs and the MSSs to a failing query are not obvious. The search space of subqueries is large. Despite work on MFSs in the past, the algorithmic complexity of these identification problems had remained uncharted. This paper shows the complexity profile of MFS and MSS identification.

Facilitating the Exchange of Explicit Knowledge Through Ontology Mappings In this paper, we give an overview of a system (CAIMAN) that can facilitate the exchange of relevant documents between geographically dispersed people in Communities of Interest. The nature of Communities of Interest prevents the creation and enforcement of a common organizational scheme for documents, to which all community members adhere. Each community member organizes her documents according to her own categorization scheme (ontology). CAIMAN exploits this personal ontology, which is essentially the perspective of a user on a domain, for information retrieval. Related documents are retrieved on a concept granularity level from a central community document repository. To find the related concepts in the queried ontology, CAIMAN performs an ontology mapping. The ontology mapping in CAIMAN is based on a novel approach, which considers the concepts in an ontology implicitly represented by the documents assigned to each concept. Using machine learning techniques for text classification, a concept in a personal ontology is mapped to a concept in a community ontology. The CAIMAN system uses this mapping to provide document publishing and retrieval services both for the community and the user. First results of the prototype system showed that this approach can be a valid alternative to existing techniques for information retrieval.

Implementing a Knowledge Date-a-Base Knowledge-based systems are very useful, but can be  dicult to design because of the complexity of the realworld  knowledge they represent. This paper compares  the experiences of building the same knowledge base by  hand in two dierent systems, Otter and CLIPS. The  knowledge base considered is that of people's preferences  towards others, in the interests of nding a \dating  match." Finally, this paper considers Horn theorems  and their impact on the usefulness of knowledge  systems.  Introduction  Because technology and automation are increasingly becoming a part of everyday life, it is benecial to enable technology to \understand" its application area. An obvious way of doing this is to implement and embed a knowledge base in an application. However, designing a good knowledge base is not trivial. A good knowledge base needs to be general so it can be reused, complete to avoid bad models, and ecient in description and time.  This paper presents the authors' experiences implement...

Jazz: An Extensible Zoomable User Interface Graphics Toolkit in Java In this paper we investigate the use of scene graphs as a general approach for implementing two-dimensional (2D) graphical applications, and in particular Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs). Scene graphs are typically found in three-dimensional (3D) graphics packages such as Sun's Java3D and SGI's OpenInventor. They have not been widely adopted by 2D graphical user interface toolkits.  To explore the effectiveness of scene graph techniques, we have developed Jazz, a general-purpose 2D scene graph toolkit. Jazz is implemented in Java using Java2D, and runs on all platforms that support Java 2. This paper describes Jazz and the lessons we learned using Jazz for ZUIs. It also discusses how 2D scene graphs can be applied to other application areas.  Keywords  Zoomable User Interfaces (ZUIs), Animation, Graphics, User Interface Management Systems (UIMS), Pad++, Jazz.

Designing Agent-Oriented Systems by Analysing Agent Interactions . We propose a preliminary methodology for agent-oriented software  engineering based on the idea of agent interaction analysis. This approach uses  interactions between undetermined agents as the primary component of analysis  and design. Agents as a basis for software engineering are useful because they  provide a powerful and intuitive abstraction which can increase the comprehensiblity  of a complex design. The paper describes a process by which the designer  can derive the interactions that can occur in a system satisfying the given requirements  and use them to design the structure of an agent-based system, including  the identification of the agents themselves. We suggest that this approach has the  flexibility necessary to provide agent-oriented designs for open and complex applications,  and has value for future maintenance and extension of these systems.  1

Component Based Agent Construction . In this paper, an agent architecture is proposed that can be used to integrate pre-existing components that provide the domain dependent agent functionality. The key integrating feature of the agent is an active message board that is used for inter-component, hence intra-agent communication. The board is active because it automatically forwards messages to components, they do not have to poll the message board. It does this on the basis of message pattern functions that components place on the board using advertisement messages. These functions can contain component provided semantic tests on the content of the message, they can also communicate with any other component whilst they are being applied. In addition an agent management toolkit, called ALFA, is described which offers a set of agent management services. This toolkit consists of a number of servers for storing the code of the components and symbolic descriptions of agents regarding their component makeup. A third server use...

Searching Documents on the Intranet Searching for documents on the internet with today‚Äôs search engines, which are mainly based on words in a document, is not satisfactory. Results can be improved by also taking the content of a document into account. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) enables us to do semantic tagging and to make the structure of a document explicit. But this describes a document only at the syntactical level. A more ideal situation would be when the XML tagging is also used to define the document at the semantical level. To realize this we allow an author of a document to describe the relevant concepts by means of tags like he would design an object-oriented database schema. In our approach a user searching for a particular document is presented a graphical description of such a schema, that describes the concepts defined for the webspace of an intranet. Via this interface the user can formulate OO-like queries or navigate to relevant web pages. To realize our ideas we are building an architecture based on the concept of an index-database. A prototype is up and running.

CiteSeer: An Autonomous Web Agent for Automatic Retrieval and Identification of Interesting Publications Published research papers available on the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) are often poorly organized, often exist in non-text form (e.g. Postscript) documents, and increase in quantity daily. Significant amounts of time and effort are commonly needed to find interesting and relevant publications on the Web. We have developed a Web based information agent that assists the user in the process of performing a scientific literature search. Given a set of keywords, the agent uses Web search engines and heuristics to locate and download papers. The papers are parsed in order to extract information features such as the abstract and individually identified citations which are placed into an SQL database. The agent's Web interface can be used to find relevant papers in the database using keyword searches, or by navigating the links between papers formed by the citations. Links to both "citing" and "cited" publications can be followed. In addition to simple browsing and keyword searches, the agent ...

Future Multimedia User Interfaces this article, we examine some of the work that has been done in these two fields and explore where they are heading. First, we review their often-confusing terminology and provide a brief historical overview. Since both fields rely largely on relatively unusual, and largely immature, hardware technologies, we next provide a high-level introduction to important hardware issues. This is followed by a description of the key approaches to system architecture used by current researchers. We then build on the background provided by these sections to lay out a set of current research issues and directions for future work. Throughout, we attempt to emphasize the many ways in which virtual environments and ubiquitous computing can complement each other, creating an exciting new form of multimedia computing that is far more powerful than either approach would make possible alone.

The SDCC Framework For Integrating Existing Algorithms for Diverse Data Warehouse Maintenance Tasks Recently proposed view maintenance algorithms tackle the problem of concurrent data updates happening at different autonomous ISs, whereas the EVE system addresses the maintenance of a data warehouse after schema changes of ISs. The concurrency of schema changes and data updates still remains an unexplored problem however. This paper now provides a first solution that guarantees concurrent view definition evolution and view extent maintenance of a DW defined over distributed ISs. For this problem, we introduce a framework called SDCC (Schema change and Data update Concurrency Control) system. SDCC integrates  existing algorithms designed to address view maintenance subproblems, such as view extent maintenance after IS data updates, view definition evolution after IS schema changes, and view extent adaptation after view definition changes, into one system by providing  protocols that enable them to correctly co-exist and collaborate. SDCC tracks any potential faulty updates of the DW ca...

eMediator: A Next Generation Electronic Commerce Server This paper presents eMediator, an electronic commerce server prototype that demonstrates ways in which algorithmic support and game-theoretic incentive engineering can jointly improve the efficiency of ecommerce. eAuctionHouse, the configurable auction server, includes a variety of generalized combinatorial auctions and exchanges, pricing schemes, bidding languages, mobile agents, and user support for choosing an auction type. We introduce two new logical bidding languages for combinatorial markets: the XOR bidding language and the OR-of-XORs bidding language. Unlike the traditional OR bidding language, these are fully expressive. They therefore enable the use of the Clarke-Groves pricing mechanism for motivating the bidders to bid truthfully. eAuctionHouse also supports supply/demand curve bidding. eCommitter, the leveled commitment contract optimizer, determines the optimal contract price and decommitting penalties for a variety of leveled commitment contracting mechanisms, taking into account that rational agents will decommit strategically in Nash equilibrium. It also determines the optimal decommitting strategies for any given leveled commitment contract. eExchangeHouse, the safe exchange planner, enables unenforced anonymous exchanges by dividing the exchange into chunks and sequencing those chunks to be delivered safely in alternation between the buyer and the seller.

Intelligent Crawling on the World Wide Web with Arbitrary Predicates The enormous growth of the world wide web in recent years has made it important to perform resource discovery efficiently. Consequently, several new ideas have been proposed in recent years; among them a key technique is focused crawling which is able to crawl particular topical portions of the world wide web quickly without having to explore all web pages. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of intelligent crawling which actually learns characteristics of the linkage structure of the world wide web while performing the crawling. Specifically, the intelligent crawler uses the inlinking web page content, candidate URL structure, or other behaviors of the inlinking web pages or siblings in order to estimate the probability that a candidate is useful for a given crawl. This is a much more general framework than the focused crawling technique which is based on a pre-defined understanding of the topical structure of the web. The techniques discussed in this paper are applicable for crawling web pages which satisfy arbitrary user-defined predicates such as topical queries, keyword queries or any combinations of the above. Unlike focused crawling, it is not necessary to provide representative topical examples, since the crawler can learn its way into the appropriate topic. We refer to this technique as intelligent crawling because of its adaptive nature in adjusting to the web page linkage structure. The learning crawler is capable of reusing the knowledge gained in a given crawl in order to provide more efficient crawling for closely related predicates.

OILing the way to Machine Understandable Bioinformatics Resources The complex questions and analyses posed by biologists, as well as the diverse data resources they develop, require the fusion of evidence from different, independently developed and heterogeneous resources. The web as an enabler for interoperability has been an excellent mechanism for data publication and transportation. Successful exchange and integration of information, however, depends on a shared language for communication (a terminology) and a shared understanding of what the data means (an ontology). Without this kind of understanding, semantic heterogeneity remains a problem for both humans and machines. One means of dealing with heterogeneity in bioinformatics resources is through terminology founded upon an ontology. Bioinformatics resources tend to be rich in human readable and understandable annotation, with each resource using its own terminology. These resources are machine readable, but not machine understandable. Ontologies have a role in increasing this machine understanding, reducing the semantic heterogeneity between resources and thus promoting the flexible and reliable interoperation of bioinformatics resources. This paper describes a solution derived from the semantic web (a machine understandable WWW), the Ontology Inference Layer (OIL), as a solution for semantic bioinformatics resources. The nature of the heterogeneity problems are presented along with a description of how metadata from domain ontologies can be used to alleviate this problem. A companion paper in this issue gives an example of the development of a bioontology using OIL. Keywords:  Ontology; OIL; semantics; interoperation; heterogeneity; understanding. 1

Tractable Query Answering in Indefinite Constraint Databases: Basic Results and Applications to Querying Spatiotemporal Information . We consider the scheme of indefinite constraint databases  proposed by Koubarakis. This scheme can be used to represent indefinite  information arising in temporal, spatial and truly spatiotemporal  applications. The main technical problem that we address in this paper is  the discovery of tractable classes of databases and queries in this scheme.  We start with the assumption that we have a class of constraints C with  satisfiability and variable elimination problems that can be solved in  PTIME. Under this assumption, we show that there are several general  classes of databases and queries for which query evaluation can be done  with PTIME data complexity. We then search for tractable instances of  C in the area of temporal and spatial constraints. Classes of constraints  with tractable satisfiability problems can be easily found in the literature.  The largest class that we consider is the class of Horn disjunctive  linear constraints over the rationals. Because variable eliminati...

Generating, Executing and Revising Schedules for Autonomous Robot Office Couriers Scheduling the tasks of an autonomous robot office courier and carrying out the scheduled tasks reliably and efficiently pose challenging problems for autonomous robot control. To carry out their jobs reliably and efficiently many autonomous mobile service robots acting in human working environments have to view their jobs as everyday activity: they should accomplish longterm efficiency rather than optimize problem-solving episodes. They should also exploit opportunities and avoid problems flexibly because often robots are forced to generate schedules based on partial information. We propose to implement the controller for scheduled activity by employing concurrent reactive plans that reschedule the course of action whenever necessary and while performing their actions. The plans are represented modularly and transparently to allow for easy transformation. Scheduling and schedule repair methods are implemented as plan transformation rules.

Special features of mobile interaction include changing orientation and position, changing venues, the use of computing as auxiliary to ongoing, real-world activities like talking to a colleague, and the general intimacy of use for such devices. We introduce and integrate a set of sensors into a handheld device, and demonstrate several new functionalities engendered by the sensors, such as recording memos when the device is held like a cell phone, switching between portrait and landscape display modes by holding the device in the desired orientation, automatically powering up the device when the user picks it up the device to start using it, and scrolling the display using tilt.

Self-Adaptive Operator Scheduling using the Religion-Based EA The optimal choice of the variation operators mutation and crossover and their parameters can be decisive for the performance of evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Usually the type of the operators (such as Gaussian mutation) remains the same during the entire run and the probabilistic frequency of their application is determined by a constant parameter, such as a fixed mutation rate. However, recent studies have shown that the optimal usage of a variation operator changes during the EA run. In this study, we combined the idea of self-adaptive mutation operator scheduling with the Religion-Based EA (RBEA), which is an agent model with spatially structured and variable sized subpopulations (religions). In our new model (OSRBEA), we used a selection of different operators, such that each operator type was applied within one specific subpopulation only. Our results indicate that the optimal choice of operators is problem dependent, varies during the run, and can be handled by our self-adaptive OSRBEA approach. Operator scheduling could clearly improve the performance of the already very powerful RBEA and was superior compared to a classic and other advanced EA approaches.

Predicting Telecommunication Equipment Failures from Sequences of Network Alarms The computer and telecommunication industries rely heavily on knowledge-based  expert systems to manage the performance of their networks. These expert systems are  developed by knowledge engineers, who must first interview domain experts to extract  the pertinent knowledge. This knowledge acquisition process is laborious and costly,  and typically is better at capturing qualitative knowledge than quantitative knowledge.  This is a liability, especially for domains like the telecommunication domain, where  enormous amounts of data are readily available for analysis. Data mining holds  tremendous promise for the development of expert systems for monitoring network  performance since it provides a way of automatically identifying subtle, yet important,  patterns in data. This case study describes a project in which a temporal data mining  system called Timeweaver is used to identify faulty telecommunication equipment from  logs of network alarm messages.

Dynamic on-line clustering and state extraction: An approach to symbolic learning Researchers often try to understand the representations that develop in the hidden layers of a neural network during training. Interpretation is difficult because the representations are typically highly distributed and continuous. By "continuous," we mean that if one constructed a scatter plot over the hidden unit activity space of patterns obtained in response to various inputs, examination at any scale would reveal the patterns to be broadly distributed over the space. Such continuous representations are naturally obtained if the input space and activation dynamics are continuous. Continuous representations are not always appropriate. Many task domains might benefit from discrete representations -- representations selected from a finite set of alternatives. Example domains include finite-state machine emulation, data compression, language and higher cognition (involving discrete symbol processing), and categorization. In such domains, standard neural...

A Behavior-Based Intelligent Control Architecture with Application to Coordination of Multiple Underwater Vehicles The paper presents a behavior-based intelligent control architecture for designing controllers which, based on their observation of sensor signals, compute the discrete control actions. These control actions then serve as the "set-points" for the lower level controllers. The behavior-based approach yields an intelligent controller which is a cascade of a perceptor and a response controller. The perceptor extracts the relevant symbolic information from the incoming continuous sensor signals, which enables the execution of one of the behaviors. The response controller is a discrete event system that computes the discrete control actions by executing one of the enabled behaviors. The behavioral approach additionally yields a hierarchical two layered response controller, which provides better complexity management. The inputs from the perceptor are used to first compute the higher level activities, called behaviors, and next to compute the corresponding lower level activities, called actio...

Equality, Type and Word Constraints As a generalization of inclusion dependencies that are found in relational databases, word constraints have been studied for semistructured data [6] as well as for an objectoriented model [10]. In both contexts, it is assumed that each data entity has a unique identity, and two entities are equal if and only if they have the same identify. In this setting, the decidability of the implication and finite implication problems for word constraints has been established. A question left open is whether these problems are still decidable in the context of an object-oriented model M  √ü  which supports complex values with nested structures and complex value equality. This paper provides an answer to that question. We characterize a schema in M  √ü  in terms of a type constraint and an equality constraint, and investigate the interaction between these constraints and word constraints. We show that in the presence of equality and type constraint, the implication and finite implication problems for...

A Distributed Pi-Calculus with Local Areas of Communication This paper introduces a process calculus designed to capture the phenomenon of names which are known universally but always refer to local information. Our system extends the #-calculus so that a channel name can have within its scope several disjoint local areas. Such a channel name may be used for communication within an area, it may be sent between areas, but it cannot itself be used to transmit information from one area to another. Areas are arranged in a hierarchy of levels, distinguishing for example between a single application, a machine, or a whole network. We give an operational semantics for the calculus, and develop a type system that guarantees the proper use of channels within their local areas. We illustrate with models of an internet service protocol and a pair of distributed agents. 1

By investigating all 2way, 3-way, 4-way and 10-way combinations of 10 IR systems on 10 queries, we show that: (1) one can expect potentially significant amounts of improvement in performance over the best system used in the combination if enough systems are used, (2) for this number of candidate systems, the point of diminishing returns is reached when around four systems are used in the combination, (3) queries generally have too few relevant documents, causing little correlation in performance between the training set and test set; thus making it difficult to get test set improvement even when multiple systems are used, and (4) if one knows the relative past performance of the candidate s...

Normal Forms for Defeasible Logic Defeasible logic is an important logic-programming based nonmonotonic reasoning formalism which has an efficient implementation. It makes use of facts, strict rules, defeasible rules, defeaters, and a superiority relation. Representation results are important because they can help the assimilation of a concept by confining attention to its critical aspects. In this paper we derive some representation results for defeasible logic. In particular we show that the superiority relation does not add to the expressive power of the logic, and can be simulated by other ingredients in a modular way. Also, facts can be simulated by strict rules. Finally we show that we cannot simplify the logic any further in a modular way: Strict rules, defeasible rules, and defeaters form a minimal set of independent ingredients in the logic. 1 Introduction  Normal forms play an important role in computer science.

ITR: A Framework for Environment-Aware, Massively Distributed Computing physical environment in real-time, and the need to reason about emerging aggregate properties as opposed to individual component behavior. In this research we propose to develop theory, methods and tools for massively distributed, environment-aware computing (more succinctly referred to as swarm computing).  The state of swarm computing today is similar to that of sequential computing in the early 1950s. Developers painstakingly produce swarm programs by designing and programming the actions of individual devices, and converge on an acceptable program through extensive simulation and experimentation. In the pre-compiler era, skeptical programmers believed that a mechanical process could not possibly produce code of comparable quality to that produced by highly skilled machine coders and that the cost of machine time is high enough to outweigh any possible savings in programmer effort. The state of swarm programming today is similar: devices are still expensive enough an

Human Behavior Models for Game-Theoretic Agents: Case of Crowd Tipping This paper describes an effort to integrate human behavior models from a range of ability, stress, emotion, decision theoretic, and motivation literatures into a game-theoretic framework. Our goal is to create a common mathematical framework (CMF) and a simulation environment that allows one to research and explore alternative behavior models to add realism to software agents -- e.g., human reaction times,  constrained rationality, emotive states, and cultural influences. Our CMF is based on a dynamical, gametheoretic approach to evolution and equilibria in Markov chains representing states of the world that the  agents can act upon. In these worlds the agents' utilities (payoffs) are derived by a deep model of cognitive appraisal of intention achievement including assessment of emotional activation/decay relative to concern ontologies, and subject to (integrated) stress and related constraints. We present the progress to date on the mathematical framework, and on an environment for editing the various elements of the cognitive appraiser, utility generators, concern ontologies, and Markov chains. We summarize a prototype of an example training game for counter-terrorism and crowd management. Future research needs are elaborated including validity issues and the gaps in the behavioral literatures that agent developers must struggle with.

The View Holder Approach: Utilizing Customized Materialized Views To Create Database Services Suitable For Mobile Database Applications among mobile devices (i.e., a laptop vs. a pager) and the amount of information available from today's database environments and the Internet.  To this end, this dissertation presents the development of customizable view maintenance services, called the View Holder approach, whose middleware mechanism within the fixed network dynamically maintains versions of the views so that to meet the data consistency and currency requirements of a particular mobile client. In a general form, a View Holder can support a community of mobile clients with common interests. The motivation for maintaining versions is to compensate for the data changes that occurred to the materialized views that were used during disconnection as well as to reduce the cost of wireless communication. In order to maintain these views, customized view maintenance is performed at the data sources by translating the mobile machine's request into a materialization program containing a triggering

Community Search Assistant This paper describes a new software agent, the community  search assistant, which recommends related searches to  users of search engines. The community search assistant  enables communities of users to search in a collaborative  fashion. All queries submitted by the community are stored  in the form of a graph. Links are made between queries that  are found to be related. Users can peruse the network of  related queries in an ordered way: following a path from a  first cousin, to a second cousin to a third cousin, etc. to a set  of search results. The first key idea behind the use of query  graphs is that the determination of relatedness depends on  the documents returned by the queries, not on the actual  terms in the queries themselves. The second key idea is that  the construction of the query graph transforms single user  usage of information networks (e.g. search) into  collaborative usage: all users can tap into the knowledge  base of queries submitted by others.

Applying Formal Concepts to Learning Systems Validation In the problem area of evaluating complex software systems, there are two distinguished areas of research, development, and application  identified by the two buzzwords validation and verification, respectively. From the perspective adopted by the authors, verification is usually  more formally based and, thus, can be supported by formal reasoning tools like theorem provers, for instance.  The scope of verification approaches is limited by the difficulty of finding a sufficiently complete formalization to built upon. In paramount realistic problem domains, validation seems to be more appropriate, although it is less stringent in character and, therefore, validation results are often less definite. The aim of this paper is to exemplify a validation approach based on a clear and thoroughly formal theory. In this way, validation and  verification should be brought closer to each other.  To allow for precise and sufficiently clear results, the authors have selected the applicatio...

Design and Implementation of Expressive Footwear As an outgrowth of our interest in dense wireless sensing and expressive applications of wearable computing, we have developed the world's most versatile human-computer interface for the foot. By dense wireless sensing, we mean the remote acquisition of many different parameters with a compact, autonomous sensor cluster. We have developed such a low-power sensor card to measure over 16 continuous quantities and transmit them wirelessly to a remote base station, updating all variables at 50 Hz. We have integrated a pair of these devices onto the feet of dancers and athletes, measuring continuous pressure at 3 points near the toe, dynamic pressure at the heel, bidirectional bend of the sole, height of each foot off conducting strips in the stage, angular rate of each foot about the vertical, angular position of each foot about the Earth's local magnetic field, as well as their tilt and low-G acceleration, 3-axis shock acceleration (from kicks and jumps), and position (via an integrated s...

Ontobroker: How to make the WWW Intelligent . The World Wide Web can be viewed as the largest knowledge base  that has ever existed. However, its support in query answering and automated  inference is very limited. We propose formalized ontologies as means to enrich  web documents for representing semantic information to overcome this  bottleneck. Ontologies enable informed search as well as the derivation of new  knowledge that is not represented in the WWW. The paper describes a software  tool called Ontobroker that provides the necessary support in realizing this idea.  Basically it provides formalisms and tools for formulating queries, for defining  ontologies, and for annotating HTML documents with ontological information.  1 Introduction  The World Wide Web (WWW) contains huge amounts of knowledge about most subjects one can think of.

Creatures: Entertainment Software Agents with Artificial Life We present a technical description of Creatures, a commercial home-entertainment software package. Creatures provides a simulatedenvironment in which exist a number of synthetic agents that a user can interact with in real-time. The agents (known as "creatures") are intended as sophisticated "virtual pets". The internal architecture of the creatures is strongly inspired by animal biology. Each creature has a neural network responsible for sensory-motorcoordinationand behavior selection, and an "artificial biochemistry" that models a simple energy metabolism along with a "hormonal" system that interacts with the neural network to model diffuse modulation of neuronal activity and staged ontogenetic development. A biologically inspired learning mechanism allows the neural network to adapt during the lifetime of a creature. Learning includes the ability to acquire a simple verb--object language.

Managing Time Consistency for Active Data Warehouse Environments Abstract. Real-world changes are generally discovered delayed by computer systems. The typical update patterns for traditional data warehouses on an overnight or even weekly basis enlarge this propagation delay until the information is available to knowledge workers. Typically, traditional data warehouses focus on summarized data (at some level) rather than detail data. For active data warehouse environments, also detailed data about individual entities are required for checking the data conditions and triggering actions. Hence, keeping data current and consistent in that context is not an easy task. In this paper we present an approach for modeling conceptual time consistency problems and introduce a data model that deals with timely delays. It supports knowledge workers, to find out, why (or why not) an active system responded to a certain state of the data. Therefore the model enables analytical processing of detail data (enhanced by valid time) based on a knowledge state at a specified instant of time. All states that were not yet knowable to the system at that point in time are consistently ignored. 1.

NiagaraCQ: A Scalable Continuous Query System for Internet Databases Continuous queries are persistent queries that allow users to receive new results when they become available. While continuous query systems can transform a passive web into an active environment, they need to be able to support millions of queries due to the scale of the Internet. No existing systems have achieved this level of scalability. NiagaraCQ addresses this problem by grouping continuous queries based on the observation that many web queries share similar structures. Grouped queries can share the common computation, tend to fit in memory and can reduce the I/O cost significantly. Furthermore, grouping on selection predicates can eliminate a large number of unnecessary query invocations. Our grouping technique is distinguished from previous group optimization approaches in the following ways. First, we use an incremental group optimization strategy with dynamic re-grouping. New queries are added to existing query groups, without having to regroup already installed queries. Second, we use a query-split scheme that requires minimal changes to a general-purpose query engine. Third, NiagaraCQ groups both change-based and timer-based queries in a uniform way. To insure that NiagaraCQ is scalable, we have also employed other techniques including incremental evaluation of continuous queries, use of both pull and push models for detecting heterogeneous data source changes, and memory caching. This paper presents the design of NiagaraCQ system and gives some experimental results on the system‚Äôs performance and scalability. 1.

CABINS: A Framework of Knowledge Acquisition and Iterative Revision for Schedule Improvement and Reactive Repair Practical scheduling problems generally require allocation of resources in the presence of a large, diverse and typically conflicting set of constraints and optimization criteria. The ill-structuredness of both the solution space and the desired objectives make scheduling problems difficult to formalize. This paper describes a case-based learning method for acquiring context-dependent user optimization preferences and tradeoffs and using them to incrementally improve schedule quality in predictive scheduling and reactive schedule management in response to unexpected execution events. The approach, implemented in the CABINS system, uses acquired user preferences to dynamically modify search control to guide schedule improvement. During iterative repair, cases are exploited for: (1) repair action selection, (2) evaluation of intermediate repair results and (3) recovery from revision failures. The method allows the system to dynamically switch between repair heuristic actions, each of whi...

Are you ready for Yottabytes? StorHouse - Federated and Object/Relational Solution This paper describes how federated and object/relational database systems can exploit cost-effective active storage hierarchies. By active storage hierarchy we mean a database system that uses all storage media (i.e. optical, tape, and disk) to store and retrieve data and not just disk. A detailed discussion of the Atomic Data Store data warehouse concept can be found in [CB 99]. These also describe a commercial relational database product, StorHouse/Relational Manager (RM), that executes SQL queries directly against data stored in a complete storage hierarchy. This paper focuses on applications that can use, and may even require the use of, emerging federated and object/relational database technologies. Our analysis is based on two products now in development. We will refer to these as StorHouse/Fed (a federated database system that includes StorHouse/RM) and StorHouse/ORM (an Object-Relational database system). We conclude by describing candidate applications (with an emphasis on the federal sector) that can exploit the combination of costeffective active storage hierarchy with federated and/or object/relational database technology.

Efficient and Effective Metasearch for a Large Number of Text Databases Metasearch engines can be used to facilitate ordinary users for retrieving information from multiple local sources (text databases). In a metasearch engine, the contents of each local database is represented by a representative. Each user query is evaluated against the set of representatives of all databases in order to determine the appropriate databases to search. When the number of databases is very large, say in the order of tens of thousands or more, then a traditional metasearch engine may become inefficient as each query needs to be evaluated against too many database representatives. Furthermore, the storage requirement on the site containing the metasearch engine can be very large. In this paper, we propose to use a hierarchy of database representatives to improve the efficiency. We provide an algorithm to search the hierarchy. We show that the retrieval effectiveness of our algorithm is the same as that of evaluating the user query against all database representatives. We als...

The rules are contextual rewriting rules with a  restricted form of negation. They allow to underspecify text segments not  considered relevant to a given task and to base decisions upon context. A parser  for these rules is presented and consistence and completeness issues are  discussed. Some results of an implementation of this parser with a set of rules  oriented to the segmentation of texts in propositions are shown.

Algebraic rewritings for optimizing regular path queries Rewriting queries using views is a powerful technique that has applications in query optimization, data integration, data warehousing etc. Query rewriting in relational databases is by now rather well investigated. However, in the framework of semistructured data the problem of rewriting has received much less attention. In this paper we focus on extracting as much information as possible from algebraic rewritings for the purpose of optimizing regular path queries. The cases when we can find a complete exact rewriting of a query using a set a views are very "ideal." However, there is always information available in the views, even if this information is only partial. We introduce "lower" and "possibility" partial rewritings and provide algorithms for computing them. These rewritings are algebraic in their nature, i.e. we use only the algebraic view definitions for computing the rewritings. This fact makes them a main memory product which can be used for reducing secondary memory and remote access. We give two algorithms for utilizing the partial lower and partial possibility rewritings in the context of query optimization.

Mobile Agents for Information Integration . The large amount of information that is spread over the Internet is an  important resource for all people but also introduces some issues that must be  faced. The dynamism and the uncertainty of the Internet, along with the heterogeneity  of the sources of information are the two main challanges for the  today's technologies. This paper proposes an approach based on mobile agents  integrated in an information integration infrastructure. Mobile agents can significantly  improve the design and the development of Internet applications thanks  to their characteristics of autonomy and adaptability to open and distributed environments,  such as the Internet. MOMIS (Mediator envirOnment for Multiple  Information Sources) is an infrastructure for semi-automatic information integration  that deals with the integration and query of multiple, heterogeneous information  sources (relational, object, XML and semi-structured sources). The aim of  this paper is to show the advantage of the introduction in the MOMIS infrastructure  of intelligent and mobile software agents for the autonomous management  and coordination of the integration and query processes over heterogeneous data  sources.  1

Protein Structure Prediction With Evolutionary Algorithms Evolutionary algorithms have been successfully applied to a variety of molecular structure prediction problems. In this paper we reconsider the design of genetic algorithms that have been applied to a simple protein structure prediction problem. Our analysis considers the impact of several algorithmic factors for this problem: the conformational representation, the energy formulation and the way in which infeasible conformations are penalized. Further we empirically evaluate the impact of these factors on a small set of polymer sequences. Our analysis leads to specific recommendations for both GAs as well as other heuristic methods for solving PSP on the HP model. 1 INTRODUCTION  A protein is a chain of amino acid residues that folds into a specific native tertiary structure under certain physiological conditions. A protein's structure determines its biological function. Consequently, methods for solving protein structure prediction (PSP) problems are valuable tools for modern molecula...

Visual Exploration of Temporal Object Databases Two complementary families of users' tasks may be identified during database visualization: data  browsing and data analysis. On the one hand, data browsing involves extensively exploring a subset  of the database using navigational interaction techniques. Classical object database browsers provide  means for navigating within a collection of objects and amongst objects by way of their relationships.  In temporal object databases, these techniques are not sufficient to adequately support time-related  tasks, such as studying a snapshot of a collection of objects at a given instant, or detecting changes  within temporal attributes and relationships. Visual data analysis on the other hand, is dedicated to  the extraction of valuable knowledge by exploiting the human visual perception capabilities. In temporal  databases, examples of data analysis tasks include observing the layout of a history, detecting  regularities and trends, and comparing the evolution of the values taken by two or more histories. In  this paper, we identify several users' tasks related to temporal database exploration, and we propose  three novel visualization techniques addressing them. The first of them is dedicated to temporal object  browsing, while the two others are oriented towards the analysis of quantitative histories. All  three techniques are shown to satisfy several ergonomic properties.  Keywords: temporal database, object database, data browsing and analysis, visualization technique.  1

Towards a Layered Approach for Agent Infrastructure: The Right Tools for the Right Job It is clear by now that the take-up of agent technologies and the wide use of such technologies in open environments depends on the provision of appropriate infrastructure to support the rapid development of applications. In this paper, we argue that the elements required for the development of infrastructure span three different fields, which, nevertheless, have a great degree of overlap. Middleware technologies, mobile agent and intelligent agent research all have significant contributions to make towards a holistic approach to infrastructure development, but it is necessary to make clear distinctions between the requirements at each level and explain how they can be integrated so as to provide a clearer focus and allow the use of existing technologies. Our view of the requirements for infrastructure to support agent-based systems has been formed through experience with developing an agent implementation environment based on a formal agent framework. We argue that in order to provide support to developers, this infrastructure must address both conceptual concerns relating the different types of entities, and relationships between agent and non-agent entities in the environment, as well as more technical concerns. This paper describes the general requirements for infrastructure, the specific contributions from different areas, and our own efforts in progressing towards them. 1.

Boosting Applied to Word Sense Disambiguation . In this paper Schapire and Singer's AdaBoost.MH boosting  algorithm is applied to the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem.  Initial experiments on a set of 15 selected polysemous words show that  the boosting approach surpasses Naive Bayes and Exemplar--based approaches,  which represent state--of--the--art accuracy on supervised WSD.  In order to make boosting practical for a real learning domain of thousands  of words, several ways of accelerating the algorithm by reducing the  feature space are studied. The best variant, which we call LazyBoosting,  is tested on the largest sense--tagged corpus available containing 192,800  examples of the 191 most frequent and ambiguous English words. Again,  boosting compares favourably to the other benchmark algorithms.  1 Introduction  Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the problem of assigning the appropriate meaning (sense) to a given word in a text or discourse.

Characterizing Operating System Activity In Specjvm98 Benchmarks : Complete system simulation to understand the influence of architecture and  operating systems on application execution has been identified to be crucial for  systems design. This problem is particularly interesting in the context of Java  since it is not only the application that can invoke kernel services, but so does  the underlying Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation which runs these  programs. Further, the JVM style (JIT compiler or interpreter) and the manner in  which the different JVM components (such as the garbage collector and class  loader) are exercised, can have a significant impact on the kernel activities. To  investigate these issues, this chapter uses complete system simulation of the  SPECjvm98 benchmarks on the SimOS simulation platform. The execution of  these benchmarks on both JIT compilers and interpreters is profiled in detail.  The kernel activity of SPECjvm98 applications constitutes up to 17% of the  execution time in the large dataset and up to 31% i...

The DEDALE System for Complex Spatial Queries This paper presents dedale, a spatial database system intended to overcome some limitations of current systems by providing an abstract and non-specialized data model and query language for the representation and manipulation of spatial objects. dedale relies on a logical model based on linear constraints, which generalizes the constraint database model of [KKR90]. While in the classical constraint model, spatial data is always decomposed into its convex components, in dedale holes are allowed to fit the need of practical applications. The logical representation of spatial data although slightly more costly in memory, has the advantage of simplifying the algorithms. dedale relies on nested relations, in which all sorts of data (thematic, spatial, etc.) are stored in a uniform fashion. This new data model supports declarative query languages, which allow an intuitive and efficient manipulation of spatial objects. Their formal foundation constitutes a basis for practical query optimizati...

SimRank: A Measure of Structural-Context Similarity The problem of measuring "similarity" of objects arises in  many applications, and many domain-specific measures  have been developed, e.g., matching text across documents  or computing overlap among item-sets. We propose  a complementary approach, applicable in any domain  with object-to-object relationships, that measures similarity  of the structural context in which objects occur, based  on their relationships with other objects. Effectively, we  compute a measure that says "two objects are similar if  they are related to similar objects." This general similarity  measure, called SimRank, is based on a simple and intuitive  graph-theoretic model. For a given domain, SimRank  can be combined with other domain-specific similarity  measures. We suggest techniques for efficient computation  of SimRank scores, and provide experimental results  on two application domains showing the computational  feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.

Syntactic Autonomy - Or Why There is no Autonomy Without Symbols and how Self-Organization Systems Might Evolve Them Two different types of agency are discussed based on dynamically coherent and incoherent couplings with an environment respectively. I propose that until a private syntax (syntactic autonomy) is discovered by dynamically coherent agents, there are no significant or interesting types of closure or autonomy. When syntactic autonomy is established, then, because of a process of description-based selected self-organization, open-ended evolution is enabled. At this stage, agents depend, in addition to dynamics, on localized, symbolic memory, thus adding a level of dynamical incoherence to their interaction with the environment. Furthermore, it is the appearance of syntactic autonomy which enables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the same syntax. To investigate how we can study the emergence of syntax from dynamical systems, experiments with cellular automata leading to emergent computation to solve non-trivial tasks are discussed.

A String-based Model for Infinite Granularities (Extended Abstract) )  Jef Wijsen  Universit'e de Mons-Hainaut  Jef.Wijsen@umh.ac.be  Abstract  In the last few years, the concept of time granularity  has been defined by several researchers, and a glossary  of time granularity concepts has been published. These  definitions often view a time granularity as a (mostly  infinite) sequence of time granules. Although this view  is conceptually clean, it is extremely inefficient or even  practically impossible to represent a time granularity  in this manner. In this paper, we present a practical  formalism for the finite representation of infinite granularities.  The formalism is string-based, allows symbolic  reasoning, and can be extended to multiple dimensions  to accommodate, for example, space.  Introduction  In the last few years, formalisms to represent and to reason about temporal and spatial granularity have been developed in several areas of computer science. Although several researchers have used different definitions of time granularity, they comm...

Maximizing Coverage of Mediated Web Queries Over the Web, mediators are built on large collections of sources to provide integrated access  to Web content (e.g., meta-search engines). In order to minimize the expense of visiting a large  number of sources, mediators need to choose a subset of sources to contact when processing  queries. As fewer sources participate in processing a mediated query, the coverage of the query  goes down. In this paper, we study this trade-off and develop techniques for mediators to  maximize the coverage for their queries while at the same time visiting a subset of their sources.  We formalize the problem; study its complexity; propose algorithms to solve it; and analyze the  theoretical performance guarantees of the algorithms. We also study the performance of our  algorithms through simulation experiments.  1 Introduction  Web sources often provide limited information "coverage."

Broadcast of Consistent Data to Read-Only Transactions from Mobile Clients In this paper, we study the data inconsistency problem in data broadcast to mobile transactions. While data items in a mobile computing system are being broadcast, update transactions may install new values for the data items. If the executions of update transactions and broadcast of data items are interleaved without any control, the transactions generated by mobile clients, called mobile transactions, may observe inconsistent data values. In this paper, we propose a new protocol, called Update-First with Order (UFO), for concurrency control between read-only mobile transactions and update transactions. We show that although the protocol is simple, all the schedules are serializable when the UFO protocol is applied. Furthermore, the new protocol possesses many desirable properties for mobile computing systems such as the mobile transactions do not need to set any lock before they read a data item from the "air" and the protocol can be applied to different broadcast algorithms. Its performance has been investigated with extensive simulation experiment. The results show that the protocol can maximize the freshness of the data items provided to mobile transactions and the broadcast overhead is not heavy especially when the arrival rate of the update  transactions is not very high.

Process- and Agent-Based Modelling Techniques for Dialogue Systems and Virtual Environments This text presents results of ongoing research, which is aimed at developing a framework for developing multimodal natural language dialogue systems operating within virtual environments. The aspects of multimodality and presence in a virtual environment are chosen as the main focus of this research. It may be argued that specification techniques would form the basis of such a framework. Therefore, a general overview and evaluation is given of existing specification techniques for interactive systems, based on both literature and previous research results. This includes the object-oriented model, process algebras, interactor models, and agent systems. Agent systems are further subdivided into intentional logics, production rule systems, agent communication languages, agent platforms, and agent architectures. A new agent system is proposed, which is based on update notification mechanisms as found in interactor models, and the `facilitator' function as found in some agent platfo...

Probabilistic Deduction with Conditional Constraints over Basic Events We study the problem of probabilistic deduction with conditional constraints over basic events. We show that globally complete probabilistic deduction with conditional constraints over basic events is NP-hard. We then concentrate on the special case of probabilistic deduction in conditional constraint trees. We elaborate very efficient techniques for globally complete probabilistic deduction. In detail, for conditional constraint trees with point probabilities, we present a local approach to globally complete probabilistic deduction, which runs in linear time in the size of the conditional constraint trees. For conditional constraint trees with interval probabilities, we show that globally complete probabilistic deduction can be done in a global approach by solving nonlinear programs. We show how these nonlinear programs can be transformed into equivalent linear programs, which are solvable in polynomial time in the size of the conditional constraint trees. 1.

A Mobile Agent-Based Active Network Architecture Active networks enable customization of network functionality without the lengthy standard-mediated committee processes. Most of the works in the literature utilize the capsules or active packets as the means to transfer code information across active networks. In this paper, we propose an active network infrastructure based on mobile agents technologies. In our prototype implementation, mobile agents are the building blocks of carrying functional customizations, and the active nodes offer software application layers, the Agent Servers, to process mobile agent-specific customizations to facilitate network functionality. Both integrated and discrete operational models of network customizations are supported. In addition, for the application-specific protocol development and deployment, an abstract protocol structure and a protocol loading mechanism are presented. Furthermore, we provide an agent management/control mechanism and devise a protocol management /control mechanism. As a result, improved network functionality can be achieved.  1

Extraction and Classification of Visual Motion Patterns for Hand Gesture Recognition We present a new method for extracting and classifying motion patterns to recognize hand gestures. First, motion segmentation of the image sequence is generated based on a multiscale transform and attributed graph matching of regions across frames. This produces region correspondences and their affine transformations. Second, color information of motion regions is used to determine skin regions. Third, human head and palm regions are identified based on the shape and size of skin areas in motion. Finally, affine transformations defining a region's motion between successive frames are concatenated to construct the region's motion trajectory. Gestural motion trajectories are then classified by a time-delay neural network trained with backpropagation learning algorithm. Our experimental results show that hand gestures can be recognized well using motion patterns.  1 Introduction  This paper is concerned with the problem of detecting two-dimensional motion across image frames and classifyi...

Temporal Objects for Spatio-Temporal Data Models and a Comparison of Their Representations Abstract: Currently, there are strong efforts to integrate spatial and temporal database technology into spatio-temporal database systems. This paper views the topic from a rather fundamental perspective and makes several contributions. First, it reviews existing temporal and spatial data models and presents a completely new approach to temporal data modeling based on the very general notion of temporal object. The definition of temporal objects is centered around the observation that anything that changes over time can be expressed as a function over time. For the modeling of spatial objects the well known concept of spatial data types is employed. As specific subclasses, linear temporal and spatial objects are identified. Second, the paper proposes the database embedding of temporal objects by means of the abstract data type (ADT) approach to the integration of complex objects into databases. Furthermore, we make statements about the expressiveness of different temporal and spatial database embeddings. Third, we consider the combination of temporal and spatial objects into spatio-temporal objects in (relational) databases. We explain various alternatives for spatio-temporal data models and databases and compare their expressiveness. Spatio-temporal objects turn out to be specific instances of temporal objects. 1

Using Digital but Physical Surrogates to Mediate Awareness, Communication and Privacy in Media Spaces Digital but physical surrogates are tangible representations of remote people, typically members of small intimate teams, positioned within an office and under digital control. Surrogates selectively collect and present awareness information about the people they represent. They also react to people's explicit and implicit physical actions: a person's explicit acts include grasping and moving them, while implicit acts include one's proximity to the surrogate. By responding appropriately to these physical actions of people, surrogates can control the communication capabilities of a media space in a natural way. This enables the smooth transition from awareness to casual interaction while mitigating concerns about privacy.

For evaluation purposes a usability test was conducted proving  the suitability of the implemented special needs adaptations. The future goal of this work is a user  interface for all (UI4All) for a standard Webbrowser. With regard to this perspective, the WebAdapter  is still an reactive approach in that it only reacts to shortcomings of common Webbrowsers instead of  proactively integrating a standardized software layer between the user front-end and underlying  applications by which the I/O-Interface can easily and universally be adapted to a variety of different  personal needs of handicapped as well as able-bodied end-users. Thus, the WebAdapter only illustrates...

Text Mining with Information Extraction The popularity of the Web and the large number of documents available in electronic form has motivated the search for hidden knowledge in text collections. Consequently, there is growing research interest in the general topic of text mining. In this paper, we develop a text-mining system by integrating methods from Information Extraction (IE) and Data Mining (Knowledge Discovery from Databases or KDD). By utilizing existing IE and KDD techniques, text-mining systems can be developed relatively rapidly and evaluated on existing text corpora for testing IE systems. We present a general text-mining framework called DiscoTEX which employs an IE module for transforming natural-language documents into structured data and a KDD module for discovering prediction rules from the extracted data. When discovering patterns in extracted text, strict matching of strings is inadequate because textual database entries generally exhibit variations due to typographical errors, misspellings, abbreviations, and other

On Supporting Containment Queries in Relational Database Management Systems Virtually all proposals for querying XML include a class of query we term ‚Äúcontainment queries‚Äù. It is also clear that in the foreseeable future, a substantial amount of XML data will be stored in relational database systems. This raises the question of how to support these containment queries. The inverted list technology that underlies much of Information Retrieval is well-suited to these queries, but should we implement this technology (a) in a separate loosely-coupled IR engine, or (b) using the native tables and query execution machinery of the RDBMS? With option (b), more than twenty years of work on RDBMS query optimization, query execution, scalability, and concurrency control and recovery immediately extend to the queries and structures that implement these new operations. But all this will be irrelevant if the performance of option (b) lags that of (a) by too much. In this paper, we explore some performance implications of both options using native implementations in two commercial relational database systems and in a special purpose inverted list engine. Our performance study shows that while RDBMSs are generally poorly suited for such queries, under certain conditions they can outperform an inverted list engine. Our analysis further identifies two significant causes that differentiate the performance of the IR and RDBMS implementations: the join algorithms employed and the hardware cache utilization. Our results suggest that contrary to most expectations, with some modifications, a native implementation in an RDBMS can support this class of query much more efficiently.

Subspace Information Criterion for Non-Quadratic Regularizers - Model Selection for Sparse Regressors Non-quadratic regularizers, in particular the # 1 norm regularizer can yield sparse solutions that generalize well. In this work we propose the Generalized Subspace Information Criterion (GSIC) that allows to predict the generalization error for this useful family of regularizers. We show that under some technical assumptions GSIC is an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the generalization error. GSIC is demonstrated to have a good performance in experiments with the # 1 norm regularizer as we compare with the Network Information Criterion and cross-validation in relatively large sample cases. However in the small sample case, GSIC tends to fail to capture the optimal model due to its large variance. Therefore, also a biased version of GSIC is introduced, which achieves reliable model selection in the relevant and challenging scenario of high dimensional data and few samples.

An Evaluation of Real-Time Transaction Management Issues in Mobile Database Systems A critical issue in mobile data management is to respond to real-time data access requirements of the supported application. However, it is difficult to handle real-time constraints in a mobile computing environment due to the physical constraints imposed by the mobile computer hardware and the wireless network technology. In this paper, we present a mobile database system model that takes into account the timing requirements of applications supported by mobile computing systems. We provide a transaction execution model with two alternative execution strategies for mobile transactions and evaluate the performance of the system considering various mobile system characteristics, such as the number of mobile hosts in the system, the handoff process, disconnection, coordinator site relocation, and wireless link failure. Performance results are provided in terms of the fraction of real-time requirements that are satisfied.  1 Introduction  A mobile computing system is a dynamic type of trad...

A Shopping Agent That Automatically Constructs Wrappers for Semi-Structured Online Vendors . This paper proposes a shopping agent with a robust inductive  learning method that automatically constructs wrappers for semistructured  online stores. Strong biases assumed in many existing systems  are weakened so that the real stores with reasonably complex document  structures can be handled. Our method treats a logical line as a basic  unit, and recognizes the position and the structure of product descriptions  by finding the most frequent pattern from the sequence of logical  line information in output HTML pages. This method is capable of analyzing  product descriptions that comprise multiple logical lines, and  even those with extra or missing attributes. Experimental tests on over  60 sites show that it successfully constructs correct wrappers for most  real stores.  1 Introduction  A shopping agent is a mediator system that extracts the product descriptions from several online stores on a user's behalf. Since the stores are heterogeneous, a procedure for extracting the cont...

Exploiting Geographical Location Information of Web Pages Many information resources on the web are relevant primarily to limited geographical communities.  For instance, web sites containing information on restaurants, theaters, and apartment  rentals are relevant primarily to web users in geographical proximity to these locations.  In contrast, other information resources are relevant to a broader geographical community. For  instance, an on-line newspaper may be relevant to users across the United States. Unfortunately,  the geographical scope of web resources is largely ignored by web search engines. We  make the case for identifying and exploiting the geographical location information of web sites  so that web search engines can rank resources in a geographically sensitive fashion, in addition  to using more traditional information-retrieval strategies. In this paper, we first consider how  to compute the geographical location of web pages. Subsequently, we consider how to exploit  such information in one specific "proof-of-concept" appl...

Position Estimation for Mobile Robots in Dynamic Environments For mobile robots to be successful, they have to navigate safely in populated and dynamic environments. While recent research has led to a variety of localization methods that can track robots well in static environments, we still lack methods that can robustly localize mobile robots in dynamic environments, in which people block the robot‚Äôs sensors for extensive periods of time or the position of furniture may change. This paper proposes extensions to Markov localization algorithms enabling them to localize mobile robots even in densely populated environments. Two different filters for determining the ‚Äúbelievability ‚Äù of sensor readings are employed. These filters are designed to detect sensor readings that are corrupted by humans or unexpected changes in the environment. The technique was recently implemented and applied as part of an installation, in which a mobile robot gave interactive tours to visitors of the ‚ÄúDeutsches Museum Bonn. ‚Äù Extensive empirical tests involving datasets recorded during peak traffic hours in the museum demonstrate that this approach is able to accurately estimate the robot‚Äôs position in more than 98 % of the cases even in such highly dynamic environments.

Incorporating Quality Metrics in Centralized/Distributed Information Retrieval on the World Wide Web Most information retrieval systems on the Internet rely primarily on similarity ranking algorithms based solely on term frequency statistics. Information quality is usually ignored. This leads to the problem that documents are retrieved without regard to their quality. We present an approach that combines similarity-based similarity ranking with quality ranking in centralized and distributed search environments. Six quality metrics, including the currency, availability, information-to-noise ratio, authority, popularity, and cohesiveness, were investigated. Search effectiveness was significantly improved when the currency, availability, information-to-noise ratio and page cohesiveness metrics were incorporated in centralized search. The improvement seen when the availability, information-to-noise ratio, popularity, and cohesiveness metrics were incorporated in site selection was also significant.

Filtering Algorithms and Implementation for Very Fast Publish/Subscribe Systems Publish/Subscribe is the paradigm in which users express long-term interests (\subscriptions") and some agent \publishes " events (e.g., oers). The job of Publish/Subscribe software is to send events to the owners of subscriptions satis  ed by those events. For example, a user subscription may consist of an interest in an airplane of a certain type, not to exceed a certain price. A published event may consist of an oer of an airplane with certain properties including price. Each subscription consists of a conjunction of (attribute, comparison operator, value) predicates. A subscription closely resembles a trigger in that it is a longlived conditional query associated with an action (usually, informing the subscriber). However, it is less general than a trigger so novel data structures and implementations may enable the creation of more scalable, high performance publish /subscribe systems. This paper describes an attempt at the construction of such algorithms and its implementation. Using a combination of data structures, application-speci  c caching policies, and application-speci  c query processing our system can handle 600 events per second for a typical workload containing 6 million subscriptions.

What Shall We Teach Our Pants? If a wearable device can register what the wearer is currently doing, it can anticipate and adjust its behavior to avoid redundant interaction with the user. However, the relevance and properties of the activities that should be recognized depend on both the application and the user. This requires an adaptive recognition of the activities where the user, instead of the designer, can teach the device what he/she is doing. As a case study we connected a pair of pants with accelerometers to a laptop to interpret the raw sensor data. Using a combination of machine learning techniques such as Kohonen maps and probabilistic models, we build a system that is able to learn activities while requiring minimal user attention. This approach to context awareness is more universal since it requires no a priori knowledge about the contexts or the user. 1.

Approximating Discrete Probability Distributions With Bayesian Networks I generalise the arguments of [Chow & Liu 1968] to show that a Bayesian network  satisfying some arbitrary constraint that best approximates a probability distribution  is one for which mutual information weight is maximised. I give a practical procedure  for nding an approximation network and evaluate its application on a range of data  sets.  Articial intelligence requires the ability to reach conclusions that may be far from certain. For example an expert system for medical diagnosis may be given the symptoms of some patient and asked to provide a diagnosis | even though the background knowledge and symptom information may not be enough to determine for sure which problem actually besets the patient. Probability theory provides a plausible model for reasoning under uncertainty, since one would expect a diagnosis to be relatively probable, given the symptoms.

The case study illustrates the value of model  management as a methodology for approaching meta-data related problems. It  also helps clarify the required semantics of key operations. These detailed  scenarios provide evidence that generic model management is useful and, very  likely, implementable.

A Database Approach for Modeling and Querying Video Data Indexing video data is essential for providing content based access. In this paper, we consider how database technology can offer an integrated framework for modeling and querying video data. As many concerns in video (e.g., modeling and querying) are also found in databases, databases provide an interesting angle to attack many of the problems. From a video applications perspective, database systems provide a nice basis for future video systems. More generally, database research will provide solutions to many video issues even if these are partial or fragmented. From a database perspective, video applications provide beautiful challenges. Next generation database systems will need to provide support for multimedia data (e.g., image, video, audio). These data types require new techniques for their management (i.e., storing, modeling, querying, etc.). Hence new solutions are significant.

Optimizing Queries with Object Updates Object-oriented databases (OODBs) provide powerful data abstractions and modeling facilities but they usually lack a suitable framework for query processing and optimization. Even though there is an increasing number of recent proposals on OODB query optimization, only few of them are actually focused on query optimization in the presence of object identity and destructive updates, features often supported by most realistic OODB languages. This paper presents a formal framework for optimizing object-oriented queries in the presence of side effects. These queries may contain object updates at any place and in any form. We present a language extension to the monoid comprehension calculus to express these object-oriented features and we give a formal meaning to these extensions. Our method is based on denotational semantics, which is often used to give a formal meaning to imperative programming languages. The semantics of our language extensions is expressed in terms of our monoid calculu...

Adding Compression to Block Addressing Inverted Indexes . Inverted index compression, block addressing and sequential search on compressed text are three techniques that have been separately developed for efficient, low-overhead text retrieval. Modern text compression techniques can reduce the text to less than 30% of its size and allow searching it directly and faster than the uncompressed text. Inverted index compression obtains significant reduction of their original size at the same processing speed. Block addressing makes the inverted lists point to text blocks instead of exact positions and pay the reduction in space with some sequential text scanning.  In this work we combine the three ideas in a single scheme. We present a compressed inverted file that indexes compressed text and uses block addressing. We consider different techniques to compress the index and study their performance with respect to the block size. We compare the index against three separate techniques for varying block sizes, showing that our index is superior to each isolated approach. For instance, with just 4% of extra space overhead the index has to scan less than 12% of the text for exact searches and about 20% allowing one error in the matches.

Using WG-Log to represent semistructured data: the example of OEM . In this paper we discuss the possibility to represent synthetically semistructured information via a loose notion of schema: we say that data are semistructured when, although some structure is present, it is not as strict, regular, or complete as the one required by the traditional database management systems. Our proposal is based on WG-Log, a graph based language for the representation of WWW site information. We show how information encoded in a typical semistructured information model, as OEM, can be represented and queried by means of the WG-Log language, and how the TSIMMIS and WG-Log Web Query System can be integrated to allow site content exploration and exploitation by means of WG-Log. 1 Introduction  We say that data are semistructured when, although some structure is present, it is not as strict, regular, or complete as the one required by the traditional database management systems (see [Abi97] for a survey on semistructured data).

Using Text Elements by Context to Display Search Results in Information Retrieval Systems - Model and Research Results Information retrieval systems display search results by various methods. This paper focuses on a model for displaying a list of search results by means of textual elements that utilize a new information unit that replaces the currently used information unit. The paper includes a short description of several studies that support the model.  1. Introduction  Because of the growth in the number and scope of global databases, a special approach is required to locating information, from the perspective of the user interface. The Internet, as it exists today, is an outstanding example of a broad-base, unfocused database. Most Internet search engines display their information as a serially ordered list of results (with a partial attempt at ranking the results). In most cases, this list includes the document title, URL and, at times, the first few lines of the document. The information, as currently displayed to the user, is incomplete and insufficiently focused on the search query. This requi...

Estimating Mixture Models of Images and Inferring Spatial Transformations Using the EM Algorithm Presented at the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, Ft. Collins, CO, June, 1999. Mixture modeling and clustering algorithms are effective, simple ways to represent images using a set of data centers. However, in situations where the images include background clutter and transformations such as translation, rotation, shearing and warping, these methods extract data centers that include clutter and represent dierent transformations of essentially the same data. Taking face images as an example, it would be more useful for the dierent clusters to represent dierent poses and expressions, instead of cluttered versions of dierent translations, scales and rotations. By including clutter and transformation as unobserved, latent variables in a mixture model, we obtain a new \transformed mixture of Gaussians", which is invariant to a specied set of transformations. We show how a linear-time EM algorithm can be used to t this model by jointly estimating a mixture mo...

A Data Preparation Framework based on a Multidatabase Language Integration and analysis of data from different sources have to deal with several problems resulting from potential heterogeneities. The activities addressing these problems are called data preparation and are supported by various available tools. However, these tools process mostly in a batch-like manner not supporting the iterative and explorative nature of the integration and analysis process. In this work we present a framework for important data preparation tasks based on a multidatabase language. This language offers features for solving common integration and cleaning problems as part of query processing. Combining data preparation mechanisms and multidatabase query facilities permits applying and evaluating different integration and cleaning strategies without explicit loading and materialization of data. The paper introduces the language concepts and discusses their application for individual tasks of data preparation.

Symbiotic Interfaces For Wearable Face Recognition We introduce a wearable face detection method that exploits constraints in face scale and orientation imposed by the proximity of participants in near social interactions. Using this method we describe a wearable system that perceives ‚Äúsocial engagement,‚Äù i.e., when the wearer begins to interact with other individuals. One possible application is improving the interfaces of portable consumer electronics, such as cellular phones, to avoid interrupting the user during face-to-face interactions. Our experimental system proved> 90 % accurate when tested on wearable video data captured at a professional conference. Over three hundred individuals were captured, and the data was separated into independent training and test sets. A goal is to incorporate user interface in mobile machine recognition systems to improve performance. The user may provide real-time feedback to the system or may subtly cue the system through typical daily activities, such as turning to face a speaker, as to when conditions for recognition are favorable. 1

First-Order Queries On Finite Structures Over The Reals We investigate properties of finite relational structures over the  reals expressed by first-order sentences whose predicates are the relations  of the structure plus arbitrary polynomial inequalities, and  whose quantifiers can range over the whole set of reals. In constraint  programming terminology, this corresponds to Boolean real polynomial  constraint queries on finite structures. The fact that quantifiers  range over all reals seems crucial; however, we observe that each sentence  in the first-order theory of the reals can be evaluated by letting  each quantifier range over only a finite set of real numbers without  changing its truth value. Inspired by this observation, we then show  that when all polynomials used are linear, each query can be expressed  uniformly on all finite structures by a sentence of which the quantifiers  range only over the finite domain of the structure. In other words,  linear constraint programming on finite structures can be reduced to  ordinary query evaluation as usual in finite model theory and databases.  Moreover, if only "generic" queries are taken into consideration,  we show that this can be reduced even further by proving that such  Dept.

PlanetP: Infrastructure Support for P2P Information Sharing Storage technology trends' are providing massive storage in extremely small packages while declining computing costs' are resulting in a rising number of devices' per person. The confluence of these trends' are presenting a new, critical challenge to storage and file system designers': how to enable users' to effectively manage, use, and share huge amounts' of data stored across a multitude of devices. In this paper, we present a novel middleware storage system, PlanetP, which is designed from first principles as' a peerto -peer (P2P), semantically indexed storage layer. PlanetP makes two novel design choices to meet the above challenge. First, PlanetP concentrates on content-based querying for information retrieval and assumes that the unit of storage is a shipper of XML, allowing it to index arbitrary data for search and retrieval regardless of the applications' used to create and manipulate the data. Second, PlanetP adopts' a P2P approach, avoiding centralization of storage and indexing. This' makes PlanetP particularly suitable for information sharing among ad hoc groups of users, each of which may have to manage data distributed across multiple devices'. PlanetP is' targeted for groups of up to 1000 users'; results' from studying communities of lO0-200 peers' running on a cluster of PCs indicates that PlanetP should scale well to the 1000-member threshold. Finally, we describe BreezeFS, a semantic file system that we have implemented to validate PlanetP's utility.

Simplifying the Development of Intelligent Agents Intelligent agents is a powerful Artificial Intelligence technology which shows considerable  promise as a new paradigm for mainstream software development. However, despite  their promise, intelligent agents are still scarce in the market place. A key reason for this  is that developing intelligent agent software requires significant training and skill: a typical  developer or undergraduate struggles to develop good agent systems using the Belief Desire  Intention (BDI) model (or similar models). This paper identifies the concept set which we  have found to be important in developing intelligent agent systems and the relationships between  these concepts. This concept set was developed with the intention of being clearer,  simpler, and easier to use than current approaches. We also describe briefly a (very simplified)  example from one of the projects we have worked on (RoboRescue), illustrating the  way in which these concepts are important in designing and developing intelligent software  agents.

Distance-From-Boundary As A Metric For Texture Image Retrieval A new metric is proposed for texture image retrieval, which is based on the signed distance of the images in the database to a boundary chosen by the query. This novel metric has three advantages: 1) the boundary distance measures are relatively insensitive to the sample distributions; 2) same retrieval results can be obtained with respect to different (but visually similar) queries; 3) retrieval performance can be improved. The boundaries are obtained by using a statistical learning algorithm called support vector machine (SVM), and hence the boundaries can be simply represented by some vectors and their combination coefficients. Experimental results on the Brodatz texture database indicate that a significantly better retrieval performance can be achieved as compared to the traditional Euclidean distance based approach. This technique can be further developed to learn pattern similarities among different texture classes and used in relevance feedback.

STARTS: Stanford Proposal for Internet Meta-Searching Document sources are available everywhere, both within the internal networks of organizations and on the Internet. Even individual organizations use search engines from different vendors to index their internal document collections.

An Efficient Index Structure for OID Indexing in Parallel Temporal Object-Oriented Database Systems . In an object-oriented database system based on logical OIDs, an OID index (OIDX) is necessary to convert from logical OID to physical location. In a temporal objectoriented database system (TOODB), this OIDX also contains the timestamps of the object versions. We have in a previous paper studied OIDX performance with a relatively simple index. The studies have shown that OIDX maintenance can be quite costly, especially objects updates, because in a temporal OODB, the OIDX needs to be updated every time an object is updated. This has convinced us that a new index structure, particularly suitable to TOODB requirements, is necessary. In this report, we describe an efficient OID index structure for TOODBs, which we call The Vagabond Temporal OID Index (VTOIDX). The main goals of the VTOIDX is 1) support for temporal data, while still having index performance close to a non-temporal/one version database system, 2) efficient object-relational operation, and 3) easy tertiary storage migrati...

General Cost Functions for Support Vector Regression The concept of Support Vector Regression is extended to a more general class of convex cost functions. Moreover it is shown how the resulting convex constrained optimization problems can be efficiently solved by a Primal--Dual Interior Point path following method. Both computational feasibility and improvement of estimation is demonstrated in the experiments. 1. Introduction  1.1. Risk Minimization  In the following we will consider the problem of regression estimation: For some probability density function p(x; y) on R  n\Omega  R and some cost function  C(¬∏) find a function f that minimizes the following risk functional.  R[f ] =  Z  C(y \Gamma f(x))p(x; y)dxdy (1) However we do not know p(x; y). Instead we only have observations f(x 1 ; y 1 ); : : : (x ` ; y ` )g; x i 2  R  n  ; y i 2 R at hand that have been drawn iid (independent identially distributed) from p(x; y). Hence the first guess would be to replace p by the empirical density derived from our observations and minimize the...

A Voxel Based Representation for Evolutionary Shape Optimisation AND KEYWORDS PAGE  Title: A Voxel Based Representation for Evolutionary Shape  Optimisation  Abstract  A voxel-based shape representation when integrated with an evolutionary algorithm offers a number of potential advantage for shape optimisation. Topology need not be predefined, geometric constraints are easily imposed and, with adequate resolution, any shape can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy. However, lack of boundary smoothness, length of chromosome and inclusion of small holes in the final shape have been stated as problems with this representation. This paper describes two experiments performed in an attempt to address some of these problems. Firstly, a design problem with only a small computational cost of evaluating candidate shapes was used as a testbed for designing genetic operators for this shape representation. Secondly, these operators were refined for a design problem using a more costly finite element evaluation. It was concluded that the voxel representation can, with careful design of genetic operators, be useful in shape optimisation.  Keywords: shape optimisation, evolutionary algorithms, voxel representation.  1.

Simultaneous Learning of Negatively Correlated Neural Networks A new approach to designing neural network ensembles has been proposed recently [1]. Experimental studies on some regression tasks have shown that the new approach performs significantly better than previous ones [1]. This paper presents a new algorithm for designing neural network ensembles for classification problems with noise. This new algorithm is different from that used for regression tasks although the idea is similar. The idea behind this new algorithm is to encourage different individual networks in an ensemble to learn different parts or aspects of the training data so that the whole ensemble can learn the whole training data better. Negatively correlated networks are trained with a novel correlation penalty term in the error function to encourage such specialisation. In our algorithm, individual networks are trained simultaneously rather than sequentially. This provides an opportunity for different networks to interact with other and to specialise. Experiments on two real-w...

Global Integration of Visual Databases Different visual databases have been designed in various locations. The global integration of such databases can enable users to access data across the world in a transparent manner. In this paper, we investigate an approach to the design and creation of an integrated information system which supports global visual query access to various visual databases over the Internet. Specifically, a metaserver including a hierarchical metadatabase, a metasearch agent, and a query manager is designed to support such an integration. The metadatabase houses abstracted data about individual remote visual databases. To support visual contentbased queries, the abstracted data in the metadatabase reflect the semantics of each visual database. The query manager extracts the feature contents from the queries. The metasearch agent processes the queries by matching their feature contents with the metadata. A list of relevant database sites is derived for efficient retrieval of the query in the selected dat...

Unsupervised Learning from Dyadic Data Dyadic data refers to a domain with two finite sets of objects in which observations are made for dyads, i.e., pairs with one element from either set. This includes event co-occurrences, histogram data, and single stimulus preference data as special cases. Dyadic data arises naturally in many applications ranging from computational linguistics and information retrieval to preference analysis and computer vision. In this paper, we present a systematic, domain-independent framework for unsupervised learning from dyadic data by statistical mixture models. Our approach covers different models with flat and hierarchical latent class structures and unifies probabilistic modeling and structure discovery. Mixture models provide both, a parsimonious yet flexible parameterization of probability distributions with good generalization performance on sparse data, as well as structural information about data-inherent grouping structure. We propose an annealed version of the standard Expectation Maximization algorithm for model fitting which is empirically evaluated on a variety of data sets from different domains.

Fast Approximate Evaluation of OLAP Queries for Integrated Statistical Data We have developed a mediator architecture that integrates statistical information about energy products  from several government agencies, such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Energy Information  Administration, and the California Energy Commission. Our architecture has a dual mode of operation.  First, our system can retrieve live data from databases and web sources from these agencies. This allows  the users to obtain completely up-to-date data. However, for complex analytical queries that typically  require large amounts of data and processing, live access does not offer the level of interactivity that  some users require. Second, our system can warehouse the information from the data sources to allow  for complex analytical queries to be executed much more efficiently. However, the data would be only  as recent as the last update to the data warehouse. In this paper we describe the architecture and focus on  how to perform analytical queries against the data warehouse very efficiently. We present results using  a fast wavelet-based technique for progressive evaluation of range-sum queries. This technique allows  for returning an approximate result to the query very efficiently and for fast convergence to the exact  result. We envision users exploring many complex queries using the very fast approximate results as  guidance and only obtaining the exact results for those queries that are deemed of interest. We present  experimental results showing the efficiency of both approximate and exact queries.  1

Spatial Agents Implemented in a Logical Expressible Language In this paper, we present a multi-layered architecture  for spatial and temporal agents. The focus is  laid on the declarativity of the approach, which  makes agent scripts expressive and well understandable.  They can be realized as (constraint) logic  programs. The logical description language is able  to express actions or plans for one and more autonomous  and cooperating agents for the RoboCup  (Simulator League). The system architecture hosts  constraint technology for qualitative spatial reasoning,  but quantitative data is taken into account, too.  The basic (hardware) layer processes the agent's  sensor information. An interface transfers this lowlevel  data into a logical representation. It provides  facilities to access the preprocessed data and supplies  several basic skills. The second layer performs  (qualitative) spatial reasoning. On top of this, the  third layer enables more complex skills such as  passing, offside-detection etc. At last, the fourth  layer establishes acting as a team both by emergent  and explicit cooperation. Logic and deduction provide  a clean means to specify and also to implement  teamwork behavior.  1

Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning In this paper we investigate the use of hierarchical reinforcement learning to speed up the acquisition of cooperative multi-agent tasks. We extend the MAXQ framework to the multi-agent case. Each agent uses the same MAXQ hierarchy to decompose a task into sub-tasks. Learning is decentralized, with each agent learning three interrelated skills: how to perform subtasks, which order to do them in, and how to coordinate with other agents. Coordination skills among agents are learned by using joint actions at the highest level(s) of the hierarchy. The Q nodes at the highest level(s) of the hierarchy are configured to represent the joint task-action space among multiple agents. In this approach, each agent only knows what other agents are doing at the level of sub-tasks, and is unaware of lower level (primitive) actions. This hierarchical approach allows agents to learn coordination faster by sharing information at the level of sub-tasks, rather than attempting to learn coordination taking into account primitive joint state-action values. We apply this hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm to a complex AGV scheduling task and compare its performance and speed with other learning approaches, including at multi-agent, single agent using MAXQ, selfish multiple agents using MAXQ (where each agent acts independently without communicating with the other agents), as well as several well-known AGV heuristics like "first come first serve", "highest queue first" and "nearest station first". We also compare the tradeoffs in learning speed vs. performance of modeling joint action values at multiple levels in the MAXQ hierarchy.

Generalized Isolation Level Definitions Commercial databases support different isolation levels to allow programmers to trade off consistency for a potential gain in performance. The isolation levels are defined in the current ANSI standard, but the definitions are ambiguous and revised definitions proposed to correct the problem are too constrained since they allow only pessimistic (locking) implementations. This paper presents new specifications for the ANSI levels. Our specifications are portable; they apply not only to locking implementations, but also to optimistic and multi-version concurrency control schemes. Furthermore, unlike earlier definitions, our new specifications handle predicates in a correct and flexible manner at all levels.  1. Introduction  This paper gives new, precise definitions of the ANSISQL isolation levels [6]. Unlike previous proposals [13, 6, 8], the new definitions are both correct (they rule out all bad histories) and implementation-independent. Our specifications allow a wide range of concurr...

Learning human arm movements by imitation: Evaluation of a biologically-inspired connectionist architecture . This paper is concerned with the evaluation of a model of human imitation of arm movements. The  model consists of a hierarchy of artificial neural networks, which are abstractions of brain regions involved in  visuo-motor control. These are the spinal cord, the primary and pre-motor cortexes (M1 & PM), the cerebellum,  and the temporal cortex. A biomechanical simulation is developed which models the muscles and the complete  dynamics of a 37 degree of freedom humanoid. Input to the model are data from human arm movements  recorded using video and marker-based tracking systems.  The model's performance is evaluated for reproducing reaching movements and oscillatory movements of the  two arms. Results show a high qualitative and quantitative agreement with human data. In particular, the model  reproduces the well known features of reaching movements in humans, namely the bell-shaped curves for the  velocity and quasi-linear hand trajectories. Finally, the model's performance is compar...

Differential Join Prices for Parallel Queues: Social Optimality, Dynamic Pricing Algorithms and Application to Internet Pricing We consider a system of identical parallel queues served by a single server and distinguished only by the price charged at entry. A Poisson stream of customers joins the queue by a greedy policy that minimizes a `disutility' that combines price and congestion. A special case of linear disutility is analyzed for which it is shown that the individually optimal greedy queue join policy is nearly socially optimal. For this queueing system, a Markov decision theoretic framework is formulated for dynamic pricing in the general case. This queueing system has application in the pricing of Internet services.

Detection of Heterogeneities in a Multiple Text Database Environment As the number of text retrieval systems (search engines) grows rapidly on the World Wide Web, there is an increasing need to build search brokers (metasearch engines) on top of them. Often, the task of building an effective and efficient metasearch engine is hindered by the heterogeneities among the underlying local search engines. In this paper, we first analyze the impact of various heterogeneities on building a metasearch engine. We then present some techniques that can be used to detect the most prominent heterogeneities among multiple search engines. Applications of utilizing the detected heterogeneities in building better metasearch engines will be provided.

Speaker Tracking in Broadcast Audio Material in the Framework of the THISL Project In this paper, we present a first approach to build an automatic system for broadcast news speaker-based segmentation. Based on a Chop-and-Recluster method, this system is developed in the framework of the THISL project. A metric-based segmentation is used for the Chop procedure and different distances have been investigated. The Recluster procedure relies on a  bottom-up clustering of segments obtained beforehand and represented by non-parametricmodels. Various hierarchical clustering schemes have been tested. Some experiments on BBC broadcast news recordings show that the system can detect real speaker changes with high accuracy (mean error ' 0.7s) and fair false alarm rate (mean false alarm rate ' 5.5% ). The Recluster  procedure can produce homogeneous clusters but it is not already robust enough to tackle too complex classification tasks. 1.

We have developed an architecture that augments existing search engines so that they support natural language question answering.

In this paper we describe some probabilistic approaches to the last three of these stages. We show how our techniques apply to a number of existing search en-1 Radev et al. 2 gines and we also present results contrasting three different methods for question answering. Our algorithm, probabilistic phrase reranking (PPR), uses proximity and question type features and achieves a total reciprocal document rank of.20 on the TREC8 corpus.

Recognition of Human Action Using Moment-Based Features The performance of different classification approaches is evaluated using a view-based approach for motion representation. The view-based approach uses computer vision and image processing techniques to register and process the video sequence [6, 23]. Two motion representations called Motion Energy Images and Motion History Images [6] are then constructed. These representations collapse the temporal component in a way that no explicit temporal analysis or sequence matching is needed. Statistical descriptions are then computed using momentbased features and dimensionality reduction techniques. For these tests, we used 7 Hu moments, which are invariant to scale and translation. Principal Components Analysis is used to reduce the dimensionality of this representation. The system is trained using different subjects performing a set of examples of every action to be recognized. Given these samples, K-nearest neighbor, Gaussian, and Gaussian mixture classifiers are used to recognize new acti...

Achieving Coordination through Combining Joint Planning and Joint Learning . There are two major approaches to activity coordination in multiagent systems. First, by endowing the agents with the capability to jointly plan, that is, to jointly generate hypothetical activity sequences. Second, by endowing the agents with the capability to jointly learn, that is, to jointly choose the actions to be executed on the basis of what they know from experience about the interdependencies of their actions. This paper describes a new algorithm called JPJL ("Joint Planning and Joint Learning") that combines both approaches. The primary motivation behind this algorithm is to bring together the advantages of joint planning and joint learning while avoiding their disadvantages. Experimental results are provided that illustrate the potential benefits and shortcomings of the JPJL algorithm. 1 Motivation  Multiagent Systems (MAS)---systems in which several interacting, intelligent and autonomous entities called agents pursue some set of goals or perform some set of tasks---have...

Guided Crossover: A New Operator for Genetic Algorithm Based Optimization Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been extensively used in different domains as a means of doing global optimization in a simple yet reliable manner. They have a much better chance of getting to global optima than gradient based methods which usually converge to local sub optima. However, GAs have a tendency of getting only moderately close to the optima in a small number of iterations. To get very close to the optima, the GA needs a very large number of iterations. Whereas gradient based optimizers usually get very close to local optima in a relatively small number of iterations. In this paper we describe a new crossover operator which is designed to endow the GA with gradient-like abilities without actually computing any gradients and without sacrificing global optimality. The operator works by using guidance from all members of the GA population to select a direction for exploration.

Jinni: Intelligent Mobile Agent Programming at the Intersection of Java and Prolog . Jinni (Java INference engine and Networked Interactor), is a lightweight, multi-threaded, logic programming language, intended to be used as a flexible scripting tool for gluing together knowledge processing components and Java objects in distributed applications. Jinni threads are coordinated through blackboards, local to each process. Associative search based on term unification (a variant of Linda) is used as the basic synchronization mechanism. Threads are controlled with tiny interpreters following a scripting language based on a subset of Prolog. Mobile threads, implemented by capturing first order continuations in a compact data structure sent over the network, allow Jinni to interoperate with remote high performance BinProlog servers for CPU-intensive knowledge processing and with other Jinni components over the Internet. The synergy of these features makes Jinni a convenient development platform for distributed AI, and in particular, for building intelligent autonomous agent...

Temporal Matching under Uncertainty Temporal matching is the problem of matching  observations to predefined temporal patterns  or templates. This problem arises  in many applications including medical and  model-based diagnosis, plan-recognition, and  temporal databases.

This technique is then applied to the problem  of finding the onset of infection with Toxoplasma   Gondii.  1 Introduction  Temporal matching is the process of matching a limited set of observations to known temporal evolution patterns in order to identify the stage of evolution or determine the onset of the temporally evolving pattern. Given a sequence of observations, and some temporal evolution patterns, a temporal match consistent with the sequence of observations maps observation times to particular points in a pattern.

Intelligent Driving Agents: The Agent Approach to Tactical Driving in Autonomous Vehicles and Traffic Simulation Computer traffic simulation is important for making new traffic-control strategies. Microscopic traffic simulators can model traffic flow in a realistic manner and are ideal for agent-based vehicle control. In this paper we describe a model of a reactive agent that is used to control a simulated vehicle. The agent is capable of tactical-level driving and has different driving styles. To ensure fast reaction times, the agent's driving task is divided in several competing and reactive behaviour rules. The agent is implemented and tested in a prototype traffic simulator program. The simulator consists of an urban environment with multi-lane roads, intersections, traffic lights, light controllers and vehicles. Every vehicle is controlled by a driving agent and all agents have individual behaviour settings. Preliminary experiments have shown that the agents exhibit human-like behaviour ranging from slow and careful to fast and aggressive driving behaviour.

A Critical Note on Stable Model Semantics In this paper, we argue that both the stable model semantics and  its three-valued version are conceptually flawed.  1 Introduction  The semantics of logic programming and deductive databases has been extensively studied in the past two decades. A whole spectrum of semantic theories for logic programs have been proposed, ranging from those that infer very little information from a logic program ("skeptical") to those that infer a great deal ("credulous"). The most skeptical semantics is the well-founded semantics [4] while the most credulous is the the stable model semantics [6] and its different but equivalent three-valued versions, including 3-stable models [8], partial stable models [9] and preferred extensions [2].  The chief drawback of the stable semantics is that a two-valued stable model is not defined for all logic programs. In the three-valued variant a model is always defined but that model may leave all atoms undetermined [8]. The original problem of the non-existence of a ...

We introduce a deformable, 3D brush model, which gives the user natural control of complex brush strokes. The force feedback enhances the sense of realism and provides tactile cues that enable the user to better manipulate the paint brush. We have also developed a bidirectional, two-layer paint model that, combined with a palette interface, enables easy loading of complex blends onto our 3D virtual brushes to generate interesting paint effects on the canvas. The resulting system, DAB, provides the user with an artistic setting, which is conceptually equivalent to a real-world painting environment.

Engineering AgentSpeak(L): A Formal Computational Model Perhaps the most successful agent architectures, and certainly the best known, are those based on the Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) framework. Despite the wealth of research that has accumulated on both formal and practical aspects of this framework, however, there remains a gap between the formal models and the implemented systems. In this paper, we build on earlier work by Rao aimed at narrowing this gap, by developing a strongly-typed, formal, yet computational model of the BDI-based AgentSpeak(L) language. AgentSpeak(L) is a programming language, based on the Procedural Reasoning System (PRS) and the Distributed Multi-Agent Reasoning System (dMARS), which determines the behaviour of the agents it implements. In developing the model, we add to Rao's work, identify some omissions, and progress beyond the description of a particular language by giving a formal specification of a general BDI architecture that can be used as the basis for providing further formal specifications of more sophisticated systems.

Modelling and Design of Multi-Agent Systems Abstract. Agent technologies are now being applied to the development of large-scale commercial and industrial software systems. Such systems are complex, involving hundreds, perhaps thousands of agents, and there is a pressing need for system modelling techniques that permit their complexity to be e ectively managed, and principled methodologies to guide the process of system design. Without adequate techniques to support the design process, such systems will not be su ciently reliable, maintainable or extensible, will be di cult to comprehend, and their elements will not be re-usable. In this paper, we present techniques for modelling agents and multi-agent systems which adapt and extend existing Object-Oriented representation techniques, and a methodology which provides a clear conceptual framework to guide system design and speci cation. We have developed these techniques for systems of agents based upon a particular Belief-Desire-Intention architecture, but have soughttoprovide a framework for the description of agent systems that is su ciently general to be applicable to other agent architectures, and which may be extended in various ways. 1

Automatic Text Summarization of Multiple Documents Scientists have retrieved what appear to be normal human eggs from human ovarian tissue that was grafted onto research mice. This is the first research group to obtain mature, potentially fertilizable eggs. Results of the research are being presented today at the conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. A report published last year demonstrated that ovarian tissue which was frozen and then replaced into a woman's body resulted in ovulation and menstruation. Such methods are being considered for women being treated for cancer with methods that would severely diminish or destroy their reproductive chances. However, there is concern that the retransplanted tissue might contain cancer cells. The current study proposes to reduce that risk. This is yet another step toward enabling women to freeze ovarian tissue in their early 20's, when it is generally most productive, to delay reproduction until their later years.

Accurate Estimation of the Cost of Spatial Selections Optimizing queries that involve operations on spatial data requires estimating the selectivity and cost of these operations. In this paper, we focus on estimating the cost of spatial selections, or window queries, where the query windows and data objects are general polygons. Cost estimation techniques previously proposed in the literature only handle rectangular query windows over rectangular data objects, thus ignoring the very significant cost of exact geometry comparison (the refinement step in a ‚Äúfilter and refine‚Äù query processing strategy). The cost of the exact geometry comparison depends on the selectivity of the filtering step and the average number of vertices in the candidate objects identified by this step. In this paper, we introduce a new type of histogram for spatial data that captures the complexity and size of the spatial objects as well as their location. Capturing these attributes makes this type of histogram useful for accurate estimation, as we experimentally demonstrate. We also investigate sampling-based estimation approaches. Sampling can yield better selectivity estimates than histograms for polygon data, but at the high cost of performing exact geometry comparisons for all the sampled objects. 1.

3D Spatial Layouts Using A-Teams Spatial layout is the problem of arranging a set of components in an enclosure such that a set of objectives and constraints is satisfied. The constraints may include non-interference of objects, accessibility requirements and connection cost limits. Spatial layout problems are found primarily in the domains of electrical engineering and mechanical engineering in the design of integrated circuits and mechanical or electromechanical artifacts. Traditional approaches include ad-hoc (or specialized) heuristics, Genetic Algorithms and Simulated Annealing. The A-Teams approach provides a way of synergistically combining these approaches in a modular agent based fashion. A-Teams are also open to the addition of new agents. Modifications in the task requirements translate to modifications in the agent mix. In this paper we describe how modular A-Team based optimization can be used to solve 3 dimensional spatial layout problems.

Smart-Its Friends: A Technique for Users to Easily Establish Connections between Smart Artefacts . Ubiquitous computing is associated with a vision of everything being  connected to everything. However, for successful applications to emerge, it will  not be the quantity but the quality and usefulness of connections that will  matter. Our concern is how qualitative relations and more selective connections  can be established between smart artefacts, and how users can retain control  over artefact interconnection. We propose context proximity for selective  artefact communication, using the context of artefacts for matchmaking. We  further suggest to empower users with simple but effective means to impose the  same context on a number of artefacts. To prove our point we have  implemented Smart-Its Friends, small embedded devices that become  connected when a user holds them together and shakes them.  1

Agent-Oriented Software Engineering Agent-oriented techniques represent an exciting new means of analysing, designing and building complex  software systems. They have the potential to significantly improve current practice in software  engineering and to extend the range of applications that can feasibly be tackled. Yet, to date, there have  been few serious attempts to cast agent systems as a software engineering paradigm. This paper seeks to  rectify this omission. Specifically, it will be argued that: (i) the conceptual apparatus of agent-oriented  systems is well-suited to building software solutions for complex systems and (ii) agent-oriented  approaches represent a genuine advance over the current state of the art for engineering complex systems.  Following on from this view, the major issues raised by adopting an agent-oriented approach to  software engineering are highlighted and discussed.

In image retrieval, we have very few labeled images from query and relevance feedback so that it is hard to automatically weight image features and select similarity metrics for image classification. This paper investigates the possibility of including an unlabeled data set to make up the insufficiency of labeled data. Different from most current research in image retrieval, the proposed approach tries to cast image retrieval as a transductive learning problem, in which the generalization of an image classifier is only defined on a set of images such as the given image database. Formulating this transductive problem in a probabilistic framework, the proposed algorithm, Discriminant-EM (D-EM), not only estimates the parameters of a generative model, but also finds a linear transformation to relax the assumption of pro...

Learning to Detect Salient Objects in Natural Scenes Using Visual Attention In the primate's visual system, selective attention rapidly selects conspicuous image locations to be analyzed in more details. Such selection is guided by several low-level feature extraction mechanisms, which detect candidate salient locations based on their local properties for a given feature type (e.g., intensity, color, orientation or motion). One difficulty which arises is how the information from different modalities should be combined into a single "saliency map" controlling where visual attention should be focused. Here, we quantitatively compare three feature combination strategies (simple summation, learned linear summation, and contents-based non-linear normalization) using three databases of natural color images. 1 Introduction  Bottom-up or saliency-based visual attention allows primates to detect, in real time, nonspecific conspicuous targets from cluttered visual environments. Reproducing such nonspecific target detection capability in artificial systems has important ...

Combining Collaborative Filtering with Personal Agents for Better Recommendations Information filtering agents and collaborative filtering both  attempt to alleviate information overload by identifying  which items a user will find worthwhile. Information  filtering (IF) focuses on the analysis of item content and  the development of a personal user interest profile.  Collaborative filtering (CF) focuses on identification of  other users with similar tastes and the use of their opinions  to recommend items. Each technique has advantages and  limitations that suggest that the two could be beneficially  combined.  This paper shows that a CF framework can be used to  combine personal IF agents and the opinions of a  community of users to produce better recommendations  than either agents or users can produce alone. It also  shows that using CF to create a personal combination of a  set of agents produces better results than either individual  agents or other combination mechanisms. One key  implication of these results is that users can avoid having  to select among ag...

A Multi-threaded Approach to Simulated Soccer Agents for the RoboCup Competition To meet the timing requirements set by the RoboCup soccer server simulator, this paper proposes a multi-threaded approach to simulated soccer agents for the RoboCup competition. At its higher level each agent works at three distinct phases: sensing, thinking and acting. Instead of the traditional single threaded approaches, POSIX threads have been used here to break down these phases and implement them concurrently. The details of how this parallel implementation can significantly improve the agent's responsiveness and its overall performance are described. Implementation results show that a multi-threaded approach clearly outperforms a singlethreaded one in terms of efficiency, responsiveness and scalability. The proposed approach will be very efficient in multi-processor systems.  1.

Using Software Agents to Support Evolution of Distributed Workflow Models This paper outlines a high-level design of how software agents can be used combined with an existing CAGIS Process Centred Environment to deal with evolution of distributed, fragmented workflow models. Our process centred environment allows process fragments of the same workflow model to be located in workspaces that are geographically distributed. These process fragments can be changed independently in local workspaces causing consistency problems. We propose to use software mobile agents, offering awareness services solving conflicting updates of process fragment. Our solution is illustrated using some scenarios.  Keywords: Process centred environments, software agents, workflow model consistency, workflow model evolution, distribution, fragmentation.  1 Introduction  Dealing with evolution of workflow processes is not a trivial matter. One simple solution to this problem is to have one centralised workflow model, that cannot be changed after it is instanciated. In practice, it is ho...

On Securely Scheduling A Meeting When people want to schedule a meeting, their agendas must be compared to find a time suitable for all participants. At the same time, people want to keep their agendas private. This paper presents several approaches which intend to solve this contradiction. A custom-made protocol for secure meeting scheduling and a protocol based on secure distributed computing are discussed. The security properties and complexity of these protocols are compared. A trade-off between trust and bandwidth requirements is shown to be possible by implementing the protocols using mobile agents.

Building Efficient and Effective Metasearch Engines Frequently a user's information needs are stored in the databases of multiple search engines. It is inconvenient and inefficient for an ordinary user to invoke multiple search engines and identify useful documents from the returned results. To support unified access to multiple search engines, a metasearch engine can be constructed. When a metasearch engine receives a query from a user, it invokes the underlying search engines to retrieve useful information for the user. Metasearch engines have other benefits as a search tool such as increasing the search coverage of the Web and improving the scalability of the search. In this article, we survey techniques that have been proposed to tackle several underlying challenges for building a good metasearch engine. Among the main challenges, the database selection problem is to identify search engines that are likely to return useful documents to a given query. The document selection problem is to determine what documents to retrieve from each identified search engine. The result merging problem is to combine the documents returned from multiple search engines. We will also point out some problems that need to be further researched.

An Experimental CLP Platform for Integrity Constraints and Abduction Integrity constraint and abduction are important in query-answering systems for enhanced query processing and for expressing knowledge in databases. A straightforward characterization of the two is given in a subset of the language CHR  _  , originally intended for writing constraint solvers to be applied for CLP languages. This subset has a strikingly simple computational model that can be executed using existing, Prolog-based technology. Together with earlier results, this confirms CHR  _  as a multiparadigm platform for experimenting with combinations of top-down and bottom-up evaluation, disjunctive databases and, as shown here, integrity constraint and abduction  1 Introduction  Constraint logic programming (CLP) [10] is established as an extension to logic programming that adds higher expressibility and in some cases more efficient query evaluation.

Knowledge Discovery from Client-Server Databases . The subject of this paper is the implementation of knowledge discovery in databases. Specifically, we assess the requirements for interfacing tools to client-server database systems in view of the architecture of those systems and of "knowledge discovery processes". We introduce the concept of a query frontier of an exploratory process, and propose a strategy based on optimizing the current query frontier rather than individual knowledge discovery algorithms. This approach has the advantage of enhanced genericity and interoperability. We demonstrate a small set of query primitives, and show how one example tool, the well-known decision tree induction algorithm C4.5, can be rewritten to function in this environment. 1 Introduction  Relational databases are the current dominant database technology in industry, and many organizations have collected large amounts of data in so-called  data warehouses expressly for the purpose of decision support and data mining.

Specifying Agent Behavior as Concurrent Tasks Approved for public release; distribution unlimited Software agents are currently the subject of much research in many interrelated fields. While much of the agent community has concentrated on building exemplar agent systems, defining theories of agent behavior and inter-agent communications, there has been less emphasis on defining the techniques required to build practical agent systems. While many agent researchers refer to tasks performed by roles within a multiagent system, few really define the what they mean by tasks. We believe that the definition of tasks is critical in order to completely define what an agent within a multiagent system. Tasks not only define the types of internal processing an agent must do, but also how interactions with other agents relate to those internal processes. In this report, we define concurrent tasks, which specify a single thread of control that defines a task that the agent can perform and integrates inter-agent as well as intra-agent interactions. We typically think of concurrent tasks as defining how a role decides what actions to take, not necessarily what the agent does. This is an important distinction when talking about agents since hard-coding specific behavior may not be the ideal case. Often agents incorporate the concept of plans and planning to

Agent-Based Distance Vector Routing Mobile Agents are being proposed for an increasing variety of applications. Distance Vector Routing (DVR) is an example of one application that can benefit from an agent-based approach. DVR algorithms, such as RIP, have been shown to cause considerable network resource overhead due to the large number of messages generated at each host/router throughout the route update process. Many of these messages are wasteful since they do not contribute to the route discovery process. However, in an agent-based solution, the number of messages is bounded by the number of agents in the system. In this paper, we present an agent-based solution to DVR. In addition, we will describe agent migration strategies that improve the performance of the route discovery process, namely Random Walk and Structured Walk.

Sensor Fault Detection and Identification in a Mobile Robot Multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) is used to detect and identify sensor failures in a mobile robot. Each estimator is a Kalman filter with a specific embedded failure model. The filter bank also contains one filter which has the nominal model embedded within it. The filter residuals are postprocessed to produce a probabilistic interpretation of the operation of the system. The output of the system at any given time is the confidence in the correctness of the various embedded models. As an additional feature the standard assumption that the measurements are available at a constant, common frequency, is relaxed. Measurements are assumed to be asynchronous and of varying frequency. The particularly difficult case of 'soft' sensor failure is also handled successfully. A system architecture is presented for the general problem of failure detection and identification in mobile robots. As an example, the MMAE algorithm is demonstrated on a Pioneer I robot in the case of three different sensor failures.

Revisiting and Versioning in Virtual Special Reports Adaptation/personalization is one of the main issues for web  applications and require large repositories. Creating adaptive web applications  from these repositories requires to have methods to facilitate web application  creation and management and to ensure reuse, sharing and exchange of data  through the internet/intranet. Virtual documents deal with these issues. In our  framework, we are interested in adaptive virtual documents for author-oriented  web applications providing several reading strategies to readers. These  applications have the following characteristics: authors have know-how which  enables them to choose document contents and to organize them in one or more  consistent ways. A reading strategy and the corresponding content are  semantically coherent and convey a particular meaning to the readers. Such  author's know-how can be represented at knowledge level and then be used for  generating web documents dynamically, for ensuring reader comprehension and  for sharing and reuse. Then an adaptive virtual document can be computed on  the fly by means of a semantic composition engine using: i) an overall  document structure -- for instance a narrative structure - representing a reading  strategy for which node contents are linked at run time, according to user's  needs for adaptation, ii) an intelligent search engine and semantic metadata  relying on semantic web initiative, and iv) a user model. In this paper, we focus  on a semantic composition engine enabling us to compute on the fly  adaptive/personalized web documents in the ICCARS project. Its main goal is  to assist the journalist in building adaptive special reports. In such a framework,  adaptation, personalization and reusability are central issues for delivering  adaptive special reports.

Estimating Frequency of Change Many online data sources are updated autonomously and independently. In this paper, we make the case for estimating the change frequency of the data, to improve web crawlers, web caches and to help data mining. We first identify various scenarios, where different applications have different requirements on the accuracy of the estimated frequency. Then we develop several "frequency estimators" for the identified scenarios. In developing the estimators, we analytically show how precise/effective the estimators are, and we show that the estimators that we propose can improve precision significantly. 1 Introduction With the explosive growth of the internet, many data sources are available online. Most of the data sources are autonomous and are updated independently of the clients that access the sources. For instance, popular news web sites, such as CNN and NY Times, update their contents periodically, whenever there are new developments. Also, many online stores update the price/availab...

Efficient Support for P-HTTP in Cluster-Based Web Servers This paper studies mechanisms and policies for supporting HTTP/1.1 persistent connections in cluster-based Web servers that employ content-based request distribution. We present two mechanisms for the efficient, content-based distribution of HTTP/1.1 requests among the back-end nodes of a cluster server. A trace-driven simulation shows that these mechanisms, combined with an extension of the locality-aware request distribution (LARD) policy, are effective in yielding scalable performance for HTTP/1.1 requests. We implemented the simpler of these two mechanisms, back-end forwarding. Measurements of this mechanism in connection with extended LARD on a prototype cluster, driven with traces from actual Web servers, confirm the simulation results. The throughput of the prototype is up to four times better than that achieved by conventional weighted round-robin request distribution. In addition, throughput with persistent connections is up to 26% better than without.

Human Performance on Clustering Web Pages: A Preliminary Study With the increase in information on the World Wide Web it has become difficult to quickly find desired information without using multiple queries or using a topic-specific search engine. One way to help in the search is by grouping HTML pages together that appear in some way to be related. In order to better understand this task, we performed an initial study of human clustering of web pages, in the hope that it would provide some insight into the difficulty of automating this task. Our results show that subjects did not cluster identically; in fact, on average, any two subjects had little similarity in their web-page clusters. We also found that subjects generally created rather small clusters, and those with access only to URLs created fewer clusters than those with access to the full text of each web page. Generally the overlap of documents between clusters for any given subject increased when given the full text, as did the percentage of documents clustered. When analyzing individual subjects, we found that each had different behavior across queries, both in terms of overlap, size of clusters, and number of clusters. These results provide a sobering note on any quest for a single clearly correct clustering method for web pages.

Integrating Light-Weight Workflow Management Systems within Existing Business Environments Workflow management systems support the efficient, largely au-  tomated execution of business processes. However, using a workflow management system typically requires implementing the  application's control flow exclusively by the workflow management  system. This approach is powerful if the control flow is specified and implemented from scratch, but it has severe drawbacks if a workflow management system is to be integrated within environments  with existing solutions for implementing control flow. Usual-  ly, the existing solutions are too complex to be substituted by the workflow management system at once. Hence, the workflow management system must support an incremental integration, i.e. the reuse of existing implementations of control flow as well as their in-  cremental substitution. Extending the workflow management system's functionality ac-  cording to future application needs, e.g. by worklist and history management, must also be possible.

Efficient and Extensible Algorithms for Multi Query Optimization Complex queries are becoming commonplace, with the growing use of decision support systems.  These complex queries often have a lot of common sub-expressions, either within a single query, or  across multiple such queries run as a batch. Multi-query optimization aims at exploiting common subexpressions  to reduce evaluation cost. Multi-query optimization has hither-to been viewed as impractical,  since earlier algorithms were exhaustive, and explore a doubly exponential search space.  In this paper we demonstrate that multi-query optimization using heuristics is practical, and provides  significant benefits. We propose three cost-based heuristic algorithms: Volcano-SH and Volcano-RU,  which are based on simple modifications to the Volcano search strategy, and a greedy heuristic. Our  greedy heuristic incorporates novel optimizations that improve efficiency greatly. Our algorithms are  designed to be easily added to existing optimizers.

When a background theory is written in a normal logic program, we introduce its transaction program for computing extended abduction. A transaction program is a set of non-deterministic production rules that declaratively specify addition and deletion of abductive hypotheses. Abductive explanations are then computed by the fixpoint of a transaction program using a bottom-up model generation procedure. The correctness of the proposed procedure is shown for the class of acyclic covered abductive logic programs.

Efficient Use of Signatures in Object-Oriented Database Systems . Signatures are bit strings, which are generated by applying some hash function on some or all of the attributes of an object. The signatures of the objects can be stored separately from the objects themselves, and can later be used to filter out candidate objects during perfect match queries. In an object-oriented database system (OODB) using logical OIDs, an object identifier index (OIDX) is needed to map from logical OID to the physical location of the object. In this report we show how the signatures can be stored in the OIDX, and used to reduce the average object access cost in a system. We also extend this approach to transaction time temporal OODBs (TOODB), where this approach is even more beneficial, because maintaining signatures comes virtually for free. We develop a cost model that we use to analyze the performance of the proposed approaches, and this analysis shows that substantial gain can be achieved.

Form-Based Proxy Caching for Database-Backed Web Sites  Web caching proxy servers are essential for improving web performance and scalability, and recent research has focused on making proxy caching work for database-backed web sites. In this paper, we explore a new proxy caching framework that exploits the query semantics of HTML forms. We identify two common classes of form-based queries from real-world database-backed web sites, namely, keyword-based queries and function-embedded queries. Using typical examples of these queries, we study two representative caching schemes within our framework: (i) traditional passive query caching, and (ii) active query caching, in which the proxy cache can service a request by evaluating a query over the contents of the cache. Results from our experimental implementation show that our form-based proxy is a general and flexible approach that efficiently enables active caching schemes for database-backed web sites. Furthermore, handling query containment at the proxy yields significant performance advantages over passive query caching, but extending the power of the active cache to do full semantic caching appears to be less generally effective.

A Reinforcement Learning Agent for Personalized Information Filtering This paper describes a method for learning user's interests in the Web-based personalized information filtering system called WAIR. The proposed method analyzes user's reactions to the presented documents and learns from them the profiles for the individual users. Reinforcement learning is used to adapt the term weights in the user profile so that user's preferences are best represented. In contrast to conventional relevance feedback methods which require explicit user feedbacks, our approach learns user preferences implicitly from direct observations of user behaviors during interaction. Field tests have been made which involved 7 users reading a total of 7,700 HTML documents during 4 weeks. The proposed method showed superior performance in personalized information filtering compared to the existing relevance feedback methods.

Empirically Evaluating an Adaptable Spoken Dialogue System Recent technological advances have made it possible to build real-time, interactive  spoken dialogue systems for a wide variety of applications. However, when users  do not respect the limitations of such systems, performance typically degrades. Although  users differ with respect to their knowledge of system limitations, and although different  dialogue strategies make system limitations more apparent to users, most current systems  do not try to improve performance by adapting dialogue behavior to individual users. This  paper presents an empirical evaluation of TOOT, an adaptable spoken dialogue system for  retrieving train schedules on the web. We conduct an experiment in which 20 users carry  out 4 tasks with both adaptable and non-adaptable versions of TOOT, resulting in a corpus  of 80 dialogues. The values for a wide range of evaluation measures are then extracted from  this corpus. Our results show that adaptable TOOT generally outperforms non-adaptable  TOOT, and that the utility of adaptation depends on TOOT's initial dialogue strategies.

This RAM, containing an artificial brain with up to 75 million neurons, is then updated  by the CBM at a rate of 130 billion CA cells per second. Such speeds will enable real time control of robots and  hopefully the birth of a new research field that we call "brain building". The first such artif...

A New Research Tool for Intrinsic Hardware Evolution . The study of intrinsic hardware evolution relies heavily on commercial FPGA devices which can be configured in real time to produce physical electronic circuits. Use of these devices presents certain drawbacks to the researcher desirous of studying fundamental principles underlying hardware evolution, since he has no control over the architecture or type of basic configurable element. Furthermore, analysis of evolved circuits is difficult as only external pins of FPGAs are accessible to test equipment. After discussing current issues arising in intrinsic hardware evolution, this paper presents a new test platform designed specifically to tackle them, together with experimental results exemplifying its use. The results include the first circuits to be evolved intrinsically at the transistor level. 1 Introduction  In recent years, evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been applied to the design of electronic circuitry with significant results being attained using both computer simulations...

Finding Related Pages in the World Wide Web When using traditional search engines, users have to formulate queries to describe their information need. This paper discusses a different approach toweb searching where the input to the search process is not a set of query terms, but instead is the URL of a page, and the output is a set of related web pages. A related web page is one that addresses the same topic as the original page. For example, www.washingtonpost.com is a page related to www.nytimes.com, since both are online newspapers. We describe two algorithms to identify related web pages. These algorithms use only the connectivity information in the web (i.e., the links between pages) and not the content of pages or usage information. We haveimplemented both algorithms and measured their runtime performance. To evaluate the e ectiveness of our algorithms, we performed a user study comparing our algorithms with Netscape's \What's Related " service [12]. Our study showed that the precision at 10 for our two algorithms are 73 % better and 51 % better than that of Netscape, despite the fact that Netscape uses both content and usage pattern information in addition to connectivity information.

A Search Engine for 3D Models As the number of 3D models available on the Web grows, there is an increasing need for a  search engine to help people find them. Unfortunately, traditional text-based search techniques  are not always effective for 3D data. In this paper, we investigate new shape-based search  methods. The key challenges are to develop query methods simple enough for novice users  and matching algorithms robust enough to work for arbitrary polygonal models. We present a  web-based search engine system that supports queries based on 3D sketches, 2D sketches, 3D  models, and/or text keywords. For the shape-based queries, we have developed a new matching  algorithm that uses spherical harmonics to compute discriminating similarity measures without  requiring repair of model degeneracies or alignment of orientations. It provides 46--245%  better performance than related shape matching methods during precision-recall experiments,  and it is fast enough to return query results from a repository of 20,000 models in under a  second. The net result is a growing interactive index of 3D models available on the Web (i.e.,  a Google for 3D models).

Redundancy and Inconsistency Detection in Large and Semi-structured Case Bases With the dramatic proliferation of case based reasoning systems in commercial applications, many case bases are now becoming legacy systems. They represent a significant portion of an organization's assets, but they are large and difficult to maintain. One of the contributing factors is that these case bases are often large and yet unstructured or semi-structured; they are represented in natural language text. Adding to the complexity is the fact that the case bases are often authored and updated by different people from a variety of knowledge sources, making it highly likely for a case base to contain redundant and inconsistent knowledge. In this paper, we present methods and a system for maintaining large and semi-structured case bases. We focus on two difficult problems in case-base maintenance: redundancy and inconsistency detection. These two problems are particularly pervasive when one deals with an semi-structured case base. We will discuss both algorithms and a system for solvi...

Verifying Sequential Consistency on Shared-Memory Multiprocessors by Model Checking The memory model of a shared-memory multiprocessor is a contract between the designer and programmer of the multiprocessor. The sequential consistency memory model specifies a total order among the memory (read and write) events performed at each processor. A trace of a memory system satisfies sequential consistency if there exists a total order of all memory events in the trace that is both consistent with the total order at each processor and has the property that every read event to a location returns the value of the last write to that location. Descriptions of shared-memory systems are typically parameterized by the number of processors, the number of memory locations, and the number of data values. It has been shown that even for finite parameter values, verifying sequential consistency on general shared-memory systems is undecidable. We observe that, in practice, shared-memory systems satisfy the properties of causality and data independence. Causality is the property that values of read events flow from values of write events. Data independence is the property that all traces can be generated by renaming data values from traces where the written values are distinct from each other. If a causal and data independent system also has the property that the logical order of write events to each location is identical to their temporal order, then sequential consistency can be verified algorithmically. Specifically, we present a model checking algorithm to verify sequential consistency on such systems for a finite number of processors and memory locations and an arbitrary number of data values.  1

Secure Communication for Secure Agent-Based Electronic Commerce Applications Although electronic commerce is a relatively new concept, it  has already become a normal aspect of our daily life. The software agent  technology is also relatively new. In the area of electronic commerce, software  agents could be used for example to search for the lowest prices and  the best services, to buy goods on behalf of a user, etc. These applications  involve a number of security issues, such as communications security, system  security, and application security, that have to be solved. This paper  describes how communications security is added to a lightweight agent  framework. Secure agent-based electronic commerce applications require  communications security services. Adding these services is a rst basis  and an important enabler for the framework in order to be used for secure  electronic commerce applications.

Evolving Rule-Based Trading Systems In this study, a market trading rulebase is optimised using genetic programming  (GP). The rulebase is comprised of simple relationships between technical  indicators, and generates signals to buy, sell short, and remain inactive. The  methodology is applied to prediction of the Standard & Poor's composite index  (02-Jan-1990 to 18-Oct-2001). Two potential market systems are inferred: a simple  system using few rules and nodes, and a more complex system. Results are  compared with a benchmark buy-and-hold strategy. Neither trading system was  found capable of consistently outperforming this benchmark. More complicated  rulebases, in addition to being difficult to understand, are susceptible to overfitting.

Towards a Network File System for Roaming Users Pervasive computing aims at offering access to user's data, anytime, anywhere, in a transparent manner. However, realizing such a vision necessitates several improvements in the way servers and user's terminals interact. Most notably, client terminals should not tightly rely on an information server which can be temporarily unavailable in a mobile situation. They should rather exploit all information servers available in a given context through loose coupling with both centralized servers and groups of terminals, in a serverless manner. In this position paper, we present the design rationale of a network file system that implements transparent adaptive file access according to the users' specific situations (e.g. device in use, network connectivity, etc).

A Probabilistic Framework for Memory-Based Reasoning In this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework for Memory-Based Reasoning (MBR). The framework allows us to clarify the technical merits and limitations of several recently published MBR methods and to design new variants. The proposed computational framework consists of three components: a specification language to define an adaptive notion of relevant context for a query; mechanisms for retrieving this context; and local learning procedures that are used to induce the desired action from this context. Based on the framework we derive several analytical and empirical results that shed light on MBR algorithms. We introduce the notion of an MBR transform, and discuss its utility for learning algorithms. We also provide several perspectives on memory-based reasoning from a multi-disciplinary point of view. 1 Introduction  Reasoning can be broadly defined as the task of deciding what action to perform in a particular state or in response to a given query.

Toward Generalized Organizationally Contexted Agent Control Generalized domain-independent approaches to agent control enable control components to be used for a wide variety of applications. This abstraction from the domain context implies that contextual behavior is not possible or that it requires violation of the domain-independent objective. We discuss how context is used in the generalized framework and our current focus on the addition of organizational context in agent control. 1 Introduction  From the vantage point of a long history of research in agents and agent control components for building distributed AI and multi-agent systems, we have focused our recent efforts on approaching agent control from a generalized domainindependent perspective.

Managing Change on the Web Increasingly, digital libraries are being defined that collect pointers to World-Wide Web based resources rather than hold the resources themselves. Maintaining these collections is challenging due to distributed document ownership and high fluidity. Typically a collection's maintainer has to assess the relevance of changes with little system aid. In this paper, we describe the Walden's Paths Path Manager, which assists a maintainer in discovering when relevant changes occur to linked resources. The approach and system design was informed by a study of how humans perceive changes of Web pages. The study indicated that structural changes are key in determining the overall change and that presentation changes are considered irrelevant.

Tumor Detection in Colonoscopic Images Using Hybrid Methods for on-Line Neural Network Training In this paper the effectiveness of a new Hybrid Evolutionary Algorithm in on-line Neural Network training for tumor detection is investigated. To this end, a Lamarck-inspired combination of Evolutionary Algorithms and Stochastic Gradient Descent is proposed. The Evolutionary Algorithm works on the termination point of the Stochastic Gradient Descent. Thus, the method consists in a Stochastic Gradient Descent-based on-line training stage and an Evolutionary Algorithm-based retraining stage. On-line training is considered eminently suitable for large (or even redundant) training sets and/or networks; it also helps escaping local minima and provides a more natural approach for learning nonstationary tasks. Furthermore, the notion of retraining aids the hybrid method to exhibit reliable and stable performance, and increases the generalization capability of the trained neural network. Experimental results suggest that the proposed hybrid strategy is capable to train on-line, efficiently and effectively. Here, an artificial neural network architecture has been successfully used for detecting abnormalities in colonoscopic video images.

External Memory Algorithms and Data Structures Data sets in large applications are often too massive to fit completely inside the computer's internal memory. The resulting input/output communication (or I/O) between fast internal memory and slower external memory (such as disks) can be a major performance bottleneck. In this paper, we survey the state of the art in the design and analysis of external memory algorithms and data structures (which are sometimes referred to as "EM" or "I/O" or "out-of-core" algorithms and data structures). EM algorithms and data structures are often designed and analyzed using the parallel disk model (PDM). The three machine-independent measures of performance in PDM are the number of I/O operations, the CPU time, and the amount of disk space. PDM allows for multiple disks (or disk arrays) and parallel CPUs, and it can be generalized to handle tertiary storage and hierarchical memory. We discuss several important paradigms for how to solve batched and online problems efficiently in external memory. Programming tools and environments are available for simplifying the programming task. The TPIE system (Transparent Parallel I/O programming Environment) is both easy to use and efficient in terms of execution speed. We report on some experiments using TPIE in the domain of spatial databases. The newly developed EM algorithms and data structures that incorporate the paradigms we discuss are significantly faster than methods currently used in practice.

Using Text Classifiers for Numerical Classification Consider a supervised learning problem in which examples contain both numerical- and text-valued features. To use traditional featurevector -based learning methods, one could treat the presence or absence of a word as a Boolean feature and use these binary-valued features together with the numerical features. However, the use of a text-classification system on this is a bit more problematic --- in the most straight-forward approach each number would be considered a distinct token and treated as a word. This paper presents an alternative approach for the use of text classification methods for supervised learning problems with numerical-valued features in which the numerical features are converted into bag-of-words features, thereby making them directly usable by text classification methods. We show that even on purely numerical-valued data the results of textclassification on the derived text-like representation outperforms the more naive numbers-as-tokens representation and, more importantly, is competitive with mature numerical classification methods such as C4.5 and Ripper.  1

Hierarchical Agent Interface for Animation Asynchronous, Hierarchical Agents (AHAs) provide a vertically structured multilevel abstraction hierarchy. In this paper, we argue that this multilevel hierarchy is a convenient way to create a human-agent interface at multiple levels of abstraction. In this way, the agent has several layers of specification (input) and visualization  (output) which facilitates users with problem solving, because such an interface parallels the hierarchical and iterative nature of human creative thought processes. The AHA interface presents an intuitive, intimate interface which supports interactions on a scale from direct manipulation to delegation, depending on the user's choice. Another feature of this interface is its two modes of interaction: direct device interaction (mouse clicking) and interpretive, command line or scripting mode. This way, agents can be "forced" to perform certain activities via mouse clicks (direct control), or they can be programmed via scripts on the fly. We present example...

Answering queries using views with arithmetic comparisons We consider the problem of answering queries using views, where queries and views are conjunctive queries with arithmetic comparisons (CQACs) over dense orders. Previous work only considered limited variants of this problem, without giving a complete solution. We have developed a novel algorithm to obtain maximally-contained rewritings (MCRs) for queries having left (or right) semi-interval-comparison predicates. For semi-interval queries, we show that the language of finite unions of CQAC rewritings is not sufficient to find a maximally-contained solution, and identify cases where datalog is sufficient. Finally, we show that it is decidable to obtain equivalent rewritings for CQAC queries.

TimeFinder includes windows for timebox queries, individual time-series, and details-on-demand. Other features include drag-and-drop support for query-by-example and graphical envelopes for displaying the extent of the entire data set and result set from a given query. Extensions involving increased expressive power and general temporal data sets are discussed.

Hierarchical Optimization of Policy-Coupled Semi-Markov Decision Processes One general strategy for approximately solving large Markov decision processes is "divide-and-conquer": the original problem is decomposed into sub-problems which interact with each other, but yet can be solved independently by taking into account the nature of the interaction. In this paper we focus on a class of "policy-coupled" semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs), which arise in many nonstationary real-world multi-agent tasks, such as manufacturing and robotics. The nature of the interaction among sub-problems (agents) is more subtle than that studied previously: the components of a sub-SMDP, namely the available states and actions, transition probabilities and rewards, depend on the policies used in solving the "neighboring" sub-SMDPs. This "strongly-coupled" interaction among subproblems causes the approach of solving each sub-SMDP in parallel to fail. We present a novel approach whereby many variants of each sub-SMDP are solved, explicitly taking into account the different mod...

Reasoning over Conceptual Schemas and Queries in Temporal Databases This paper introduces a new logical formalism,  intended for temporal conceptual modelling,  as a natural combination of the wellknown  description logic DLR and pointbased  linear temporal logic with Since and  Until. The expressive power of the resulting   DLRUS logic is illustrated by providing  a systematic formalisation of the most important  temporal entity-relationship data models  appeared in the literature. We define  a query language (where queries are nonrecursive  Datalog programs and atoms are  complex DLRUS expressions) and investigate  the problem of checking query containment  under the constraints defined by  DLRUS conceptual schemas, as well as the  problems of schema satisfiability and logical  implication. Although it is shown that reasoning  in full DLRUS is undecidable, we  identify the decidable (in a sense, maximal)  fragment DLR  US  by allowing applications  of temporal operators to formulas and entities  only (but not to relation expressions). We obtain  the following hierarchy of complexity results:  (a) reasoning in DLR US with atomic  formulas is EXPTIME-complete, (b) satisfiability  and logical implication of arbitrary  DLR US formulas is EXPSPACE-complete,  and (c) the problem of checking query containment  of non-recursive Datalog queries under   DLR US constraints is decidable in 2EXPTIME.

Fine-Granularity Signature Caching in Object Database Systems In many of the emerging application areas for database systems, data is viewed as a collection  of objects, the access pattern is navigational, and a large fraction of the accesses are perfect match  accesses/queries on one or more words in text strings in the objects in these databases. A typical  example of such an application area is XML/Web storage. In order to reduce the object access  cost, signature files can be used. However, traditional signature file maintenance is costly, and to  be beneficial, a low update rate and high query selectivity is needed to make the maintenance and  use of signatures beneficial. In this report, we present the SigCache approach. Instead of storing  the signatures in separate signature files, the signatures are stored together with their objects. In  addition, the most frequently accessed signatures are stored in a main memory signature cache  (SigCache). Because the signatures are much smaller than the objects, the increase in update cost  is not s...

XML Dataspaces for Mobile Agent Coordination This paper presents XMARS, a programmable coordination architecture for  Internet applications based on mobile agents. In XMARS, agents coordinate --  both with each other and with their current execution environment -- through  programmable XML dataspaces, accessed by agents in a Linda-like fashion. This  suits very well the characteristics of the Internet environment: on the one hand, it  offers all the advantages of XML in terms of interoperability and standard  representation of information; on the other hand, it enforces open and uncoupled  interactions, as required by the dynamicity of the environment and by the mobility  of the application components. In addition, coordination in XMARS is made more  flexible and secure by the capability of programming the behaviour of the  coordination media in reaction to the agents' accesses. An application example  related to the management of on-line academic courses shows the suitability and  the effectiveness of the XMARS architecture.  Ke...

Path Constraints on Semistructured and Structured Data We present a class of path constraints of interest in connection with both structured and semi-structured databases, and investigate their associated implication problems. These path constraints are capable of expressing natural integrity constraints that are not only a fundamental part of the semantics of the data, but are also important in query optimization. We show that in semistructured databases, despite the simple syntax of the constraints, their associated implication problem is r.e. complete and finite implication problem is co-r.e. complete. However, we establish the decidability of the implication problems for several fragments of the path constraint language, and demonstrate that these fragments suffice to express important semantic information such as inverse relationships and local database constraints commonly found in object-oriented databases. We also show that in the presence of types, the analysis of path constraint implication becomes more delicate. We demonstrate so...

Discovering Structural Association of Semistructured Data Many semistructured objects are similarly, though not identically, structured. We study the  problem of discovering "typical" substructures of a collection of semistructured objects. The  discovered structures can serve the following purposes: (a) the "table-of-contents" for gaining  general information of a source, (b) a road map for browsing and querying information sources,  (c) a basis for clustering documents, (d) partial schemas for providing standard database access  methods, (e) user/customer's interests and browsing patterns.

Identifying Distinctive Subsequences in Multivariate Time Series by Clustering Most time series comparison algorithms attempt to discover what the members of a set of time series have in common. We investigate a different problem, determining what distinguishes time series in that set from other time series obtained from the same source. In both cases the goal is to identify shared patterns, though in the latter case those patterns must be distinctive as well. An efficient incremental algorithm for identifying distinctive subsequences in multivariate, real-valued time series is described and evaluated with data from two very different sources: the response of a set of bandpass filters to human speech and the sensors of a mobile robot.  1 Introduction  Given two or more sequences of discrete tokens, a dynamic programming algorithm exists for finding the longest common subsequence they share (Cormen, Leiserson, & Rivest 1990).

The Hyper System: Knowledge Reformation for Efficient First-order Hypothetical Reasoning . We present the Hyper system that implements a new approach  to knowledge compilation, where function-free first-order acyclic  Horn theories are transformed to propositional logic. The compilation  method integrates techniques from deductive databases (relevance reasoning)  and theory transformation via unfold/fold transformations, to  obtain a compact propositional representation. The transformed theory  is more compact than the ground version of the original theory in terms  of significantly less and mostly shorter clauses. This form of compilation,  called knowledge (base) reformation, is important since the most efficient  reasoning methods are defined for propositional theories, while knowledge  is most naturally expressed in a first-order language. In particular,  we will show that knowledge reformation allows low-order polynomial  time inference to find a near-optimal solution in cost-based first-order  hypothetical reasoning (or `abduction') problems.

We report on a performance study of the various schemes, identifying which schemes perform best in which settings. Based on our results, we have implemented a lineage tracing package in the WHIPS data warehousing system prototype at Stanford. With this package, users can select view tuples of interest, then efficiently "drill down" to examine the source data that produced them. 1 Introduction Data warehousing systems collect data from multiple distributed sources, integrate the information as materialized v...

Enabling Technologies for Interoperability We present a new approach, which proposes to minimize  the numerous problems existing in order to have  fully interoperable GIS. We discuss the existence of  these heterogeneity problems and the fact that they  must be solved to achieve interoperability. These problems  are addressed on three levels: the syntactic, structural  and semantic level. In addition, we identify the  needs for an approach performing semantic translation  for interoperability and introduce a uniform description  of contexts. Furthermore, we discuss a conceptual  architecture Buster (Bremen University Semantic  Translation for Enhanced Retrieval) which can provide  intelligent information integration based on a reclassification  of information entities in a new context.  Lastly, we demonstrate our theories by sketching a real  life scenario.

Adapting Hidden Markov Models for ASL Recognition by Using Three-dimensional Computer Vision Methods We present an approach to continuous American Sign Language (ASL) recognition, which uses as input three-dimensional data of arm motions. We use computer vision methods for three-dimensional object shape and motion parameter extraction and an Ascension Technologies Flock of Birds interchangeably to obtain accurate three-dimensional movement parameters of ASL sentences, selected from a 53-sign vocabulary and a widely varied sentence structure. These parameters are used as features for Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). To address coarticulation e#ects and improve our recognition results, we experimented with two di#erent approaches. The first consists of training context-dependent HMMs and is inspired by speech recognition systems. The second consists of modeling transient movements between signs and is inspired by the characteristics of ASL phonology. Our experiments verified that the second approach yields better recognition results.  1. INTRODUCTION  Sign language and gesture recognition h...

Experience with EMERALD to Date After summarizing the EMERALD architecture and the evolutionary process from which EMERALD has evolved, this paper focuses on our experience to date in designing, implementing, and applying EMERALD to various types of anomalies and misuse. The discussion addresses the fundamental importance of good software engineering practice and the importance of the system architecture -- in attaining detectability, interoperability, general applicability, and future evolvability. It also considers the importance of correlation among distributed and hierarchical instances of EMERALD, and needs for additional detection and analysis components. 1.

Selecting Text Spans for Document Summaries: Heuristics and Metrics Human-quality text summarization systems are difficult to design, and even more difficult to evaluate, in part because documents can differ along several dimensions, such as length, writing style and lexical usage. Nevertheless, certain cues can often help suggest the selection of sentences for inclusion in a summary. This paper presents an analysis of news-article summaries generated by sentence extraction. Sentences are ranked for potential inclusion in the summary using a weighted combination of linguistic features -- derived from an analysis of news-wire summaries. This paper evaluates the relative effectiveness of these features. In order to do so, we discuss the construction of a large corpus of extraction-based summaries, and characterize the underlying degree of difficulty of summarization at different compression levels on articles in this corpus. Results on our feature set are presented after normalization by this degree of difficulty.

Assessment Methods for Information Quality Criteria Information quality (IQ) is one of the most important aspects of information integration on the Internet. Many projects realize and address this fact by gathering and classifying IQ criteria. Hardly ever do the projects address the immense difficulty of assessing scores for the criteria. This task must precede any usage of criteria for qualifying and integrating information.  After reviewing previous attempts to classify IQ criteria, in this paper we also classify criteria, but in a new, assessment-oriented way. We identify three sources for IQ scores and thus, three IQ criterion classes, each with different general assessment possibilities. Additionally, for each criterion we give detailed assessment methods. Finally, we consider confidence measures for these methods. Confidence expresses the accuracy, lastingness, and credibility of the individual assessment methods.  1 Introduction  Low information quality is one of the most pressing problems for consume rs of information that is di...

Treating Constraints As Objectives For Single-Objective Evolutionary Optimization This paper presents a new approach to handle constraints using evolutionary algorithms. The new technique treats constraints as objectives, and uses a multiobjective optimization approach to solve the re-stated single-objective optimization problem. The new approach is compared against other numerical and evolutionary optimization techniques in several engineering optimization problems with different kinds of constraints. The results obtained show that the new approach can consistently outperform the other techniques using relatively small sub-populations, and without a significant sacrifice in terms of performance.

RoboSoc a System for Developing RoboCup Agents for Educational Use This report describes RoboSoc, a system for developing RoboCup agents designed especially, but not only, for educational use. RoboSoc is designed to be as general, open, and easy to use as possible and to encourage and simplify the modification, extension and sharing of RoboCup agents, and parts of them. To do this I assumed four requirements from the user: she wants the best possible data, use as much time as possible for the decision making, rather act on incomplete information than not act at all, and she wants to manipulate the objects found in the soccer environment. RoboSoc consists of three parts: a library of basic objects and utilities used by the rest of the system, a basic system handling the interactions with the soccer server and the timing of the agent, and a framework for world modeling and decision support. The framework defines three concepts, views, predicates and skills. The views are specialized information processing units responsible for a specific part of the wo...

Automatic Text Detection and Tracking in Digital Video Text which appears in a scene or is graphically added to video can provide an important supplemental source of index information as well as clues for decoding the video's structure and for classification. In this paper we present algorithms for detecting and tracking text in digital video. Our system implements a scalespace feature extractor that feeds an artificial neural processor to detect text blocks. Our text tracking scheme consists of two modules: an SSD (Sum of Squared Difference)-based module to find the initial position and a contour-based module to refine the position. Experiments conducted with a variety of video sources show that our scheme can detect and track text robustly.

Collections - Adapting The Display of Personal Objects for Different Audiences Although current networked systems and online applications provide new opportunities for displaying and sharing personal information, they do not account for the underlying social  contexts that frame such interactions. Existing categorization and management mechanisms for digital content have been designed to focus on the data they handle without much  regard for the social circumstances within which their content is shared. As we share large collections of personal information over mediated environments, our tools need to account  for the social scenarios that surround our interactions.

An Extensible Framework for Data Cleaning Data integration solutions dealing with large amounts of data have been strongly required in the last few years.  Besides the traditional data integration problems (e.g. schema integration, local to global schema mappings),  three additional data problems have to be dealt with: (1) the absence of universal keys across dierent databases  that is known as the object identity problem, (2) the existence of keyboard errors in the data, and (3) the presence  of inconsistencies in data coming from multiple sources. Dealing with these problems is globally called the data  cleaning process. In this work, we propose a framework which oers the fundamental services required by this  process: data transformation, duplicate elimination and multi-table matching. These services are implemented  using a set of purposely designed macro-operators. Moreover, we propose an SQL extension for specifying  each of the macro-operators.

Circumventing Dynamic Modeling: Evaluation of the Error-State Kalman Filter applied to Mobile Robot Localization The mobile robot localization problem is treated as a two-stage iterative estimation process. The attitude is estimated first and is then available for position estimation. The indirect (error state) form of the Kalman filter is developed for attitude estimation when applying gyro modeling. The main benefit of this choice is that complex dynamic modeling of the mobile robot and its interaction with the environment is avoided. The filter optimally combines the attitude rate information from the gyro and the absolute orientation measurements. The proposed implementation is independent of the structure of the vehicle or the morphology of the ground. The method can easily be transfered to another mobile platform provided it carries an equivalent set of sensors. The 2D case is studied in detail first. Results of extending the approach to the 3D case are presented. In both cases the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.  1 Introduction  On July 4th 1997, the Mars Pathfinde...

Adaptable Query Optimization and Evaluation in Temporal Middleware Time-referenced data are pervasive in most real-world databases. Recent advances in temporal query languages  show that such database applications may benefit substantially from built-in temporal support in the  DBMS. To achieve this, temporal query optimization and evaluation mechanisms must be provided, either within  the DBMS proper or as a source level translation from temporal queries to conventional SQL. This paper proposes  a new approach: using a middleware component on top of a conventional DBMS. This component accepts  temporal SQL statements and produces a corresponding query plan consisting of algebraic as well as regular SQL  parts. The algebraic parts are processed by the middleware, while the SQL parts are processed by the DBMS.  The middleware uses performance feedback from the DBMS to adapt its partitioning of subsequent queries into  middleware and DBMS parts. The paper describes the architecture and implementation of the temporal middleware  component, termed TANGO, which is based on the Volcano extensible query optimizer and the XXL query  processing library. Experiments with the system demonstrate the utility of the middleware`s internal processing  capability and its cost-based mechanism for apportioning the processing between the middleware and the  underlying DBMS.

A representation-independent temporal extension of ODMG's Object Query Language TEMPOS is a set of models providing a framework for extending database systems with temporal functionalities. Based on this framework, an extension of the ODMG's object database standard has been defined. This extension includes a hierarchy of abstract datatypes for managing temporal values and histories, as well as temporal extensions of ODMG's object model, schema definition language and query language. This paper focuses on the latter, namely TEMPOQL. With respect to related proposals, the main originality of TEMPOQL is that it allows to manipulate histories regardless of their representations, by composition of functional constructs. Thereby, the abstraction principle of object-orientation is fulfilled, and the functional nature of OQL is enforced. In fact, TEMPOQL goes further in preserving OQL's structure, by generalizing most standard OQL constructs to deal with histories. The overall proposal has been fully formalized both at the syntactical and the semantical level and impleme...

Novel Approaches to the Indexing of Moving Object Trajectories The domain of spatiotemporal applications is a treasure trove  of new types of data and queries. However, work in this area  is guided by related research from the spatial and temporal  domains, so far, with little attention towards the true nature  of spatiotemporal phenomena. In this work, the focus is on a  spatiotemporal sub-domain, namely the trajectories of  moving point objects. We present new types of  spatiotemporal queries, as well as algorithms to process  those. Further, we introduce two access methods this kind of  data, namely the Spatio-Temporal R-tree (STR-tree) and the  Trajectory-Bundle tree (TB-tree). The former is an R-tree  based access method that considers the trajectory identity in  the index as well, while the latter is a hybrid structure, which  preserves trajectories as well as allows for R-tree typical  range search in the data. We present performance studies that  compare the two indices with the R-tree (appropriately  modified, for a fair comparison) under a varying set of  spatiotemporal queries, and we provide guidelines for a  successful choice among them.

Categorization of Software Errors that led to Security Breaches A set of errors known to have led to security breaches in computer systems was analyzed. The analysis led to a categorization of these errors. After examining several proposed schemes for the categorization of software errors a new scheme was developed and used. This scheme classifies errors by their cause, the nature of their impact, and the type of change, or fix, made to remove the error. The errors considered in this work are found in a database maintained by the COAST laboratory. The categorization is the first step in the investigation of the effectiveness of various measures of code coverage in revealing software errors that might lead to security breaches. 1 Introduction  We report the outcome of an effort to categorize errors in software that are known to have led to security breaches.

Feedback From Video For Virtual Reality Navigation Important preconditions for wide acceptance of virtual reality systems include their comfort, ease and naturalness to use. Most existing trackers suer from discomfortrelated issues. For example, body-based trackers (such as hand controllers, joysticks or helmet attachments) restrict spontaneity and naturalness of motion, whereas groundbased devices (e.g., hand controllers) limit the workspace by literally binding an operator to the ground. Controls have similar problems. This paper describes using real-time video with registered depth information (from a commercially available camera) for virtual reality navigation. A camera-based setup can replace cumbersome trackers. The method includes selective depth processing for increased speed, and a robust skin-color segmentation for handling illumination variations.

Agents That Reason and Negotiate By Arguing The need for negotiation in multi-agent systems stems from the requirement  for agents to solve the problems posed by their interdependence upon one another.  Negotiation provides a solution to these problems by giving the agents  the means to resolve their conflicting objectives, correct inconsistencies in their  knowledge of other agents' world views, and coordinate a joint approach to domain  tasks which benefits all the agents concerned. We propose a framework,  based upon a system of argumentation, which permits agents to negotiate in  order to establish acceptable ways of solving problems. The framework provides  a formal model of argumentation-based reasoning and negotiation, details  a design philosophy which ensures a clear link between the formal model and  its practical instantiation, and describes a case study of this relationship for a  particular class of architectures (namely those for belief-desire-intention agents).  1 Introduction  An increasing number of software app...

How Developmental Psychology and Robotics Complement Each Other This paper presents two complementary ideas relating  the study of human development and the  construction of intelligent artifacts. First, the use  of developmental models will be a critical requirement  in the construction of robotic systems that  can acquire a large repertoire of motor, perceptual,  and cognitive capabilities. Second, robotic  systems can be used as a test-bed for evaluating  models of human development much in the same  way that simulation studies are currently used  to evaluate cognitive models. To further explore  these ideas, two examples from the author's own  work will be presented: the use of developmental  models of hand-eye coordination to simplify the  task of learning to reach for a visual target and  the use of a humanoid robot to evaluate models  of normal and abnormal social skill development.

Learning to Recognize 3D Objects A learning account for the problem of object recognition is developed within the  PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) model of learnability. The key assumption  underlying this work is that objects can be recognized (or, discriminated) using simple  representations in terms of \syntactically" simple relations over the raw image. Although  the potential number of these simple relations could be huge, only a few of  them are actually present in each observed image and a fairly small number of those  observed is relevant to discriminating an object.  We show that these properties can be exploited to yield an ecient learning approach  in terms of sample and computational complexity, within the PAC model. No  assumptions are needed on the distribution of the observed objects and the learning  performance is quantied relative to its past experience. Most importantly, the success  of learning an object representation is naturally tied to the ability to represent it as a  function of some in...

Parameter Learning of Logic Programs for Symbolic-statistical Modeling We propose a logical/mathematical framework for statistical parameter learning of parameterized logic programs, i.e. de nite clause programs containing probabilistic facts with a parameterized distribution. It extends the traditional least Herbrand model semantics in logic programming to distribution semantics, possible world semantics with a probability distribution which is unconditionally applicable to arbitrary logic programs including ones for HMMs, PCFGs and Bayesian networks. We also propose a new EM algorithm, the graphical EM algorithm, thatrunsfora class of parameterized logic programs representing sequential decision processes where each decision is exclusive and independent. It runs on a new data structure called support graphs describing the logical relationship between observations and their explanations, and learns parameters by computing inside and outside probability generalized for logic programs. The complexity analysis shows that when combined with OLDT search for all explanations for observations, the graphical EM algorithm, despite its generality, has the same time complexity as existing EM algorithms, i.e. the Baum-Welch algorithm for HMMs, the Inside-Outside algorithm for PCFGs, and the one for singly connected Bayesian networks that have beendeveloped independently in each research eld. Learning experiments with PCFGs using two corpora of moderate size indicate that the graphical EM algorithm can signi cantly outperform the Inside-Outside algorithm. 1.

The Impact of Database Selection on Distributed Searching Abstract The proliferation of online information resources increases the importance of effective and efficient distributed searching. Distributed searching is cast in three parts ‚Äì database selection, query processing, and results merging. In this paper we examine the effect of database selection on retrieval performance. We look at retrieval performance in three different distributed retrieval testbeds and distill some general results. First we find that good database selection can result in better retrieval effectiveness than can be achieved in a centralized database. Second we find that good performance can be achieved when only a few sites are selected and that the performance generally increases as more sites are selected. Finally we find that when database selection is employed, it is not necessary to maintain collection wide information (CWI), e.g. global idf. Local information can be used to achieve superior performance. This means that distributed systems can be engineered with more autonomy and less cooperation. This work suggests that improvements in database selection can lead to broader improvements in retrieval performance, even in centralized (i.e. single database) systems. Given a centralized database and a good selection mechanism, retrieval performance can be improved by decomposing that database conceptually and employing a selection step. 1

Structure Identification of Fuzzy Classifiers For complex and high-dimensional problems, data-driven  identification of classifiers has to deal with structural issues like the selection of the relevant features and effective initial partition of the input domain. Therefore, the identification of fuzzy classifiers is a challenging topic. Decision-tree (DT) generation algorithms are effective in feature selection and extraction of crisp classification rules, hence they can be used for the initialization of fuzzy systems. Because fuzzy classifiers have much flexible decision boundaries than DTs, fuzzy models can be more parsimonious than DTs. Hence, to get compact, easily interpretable and transparent classification system, a new structure identification algorithm is proposed, where genetic algorithm (GA) based parameter optimization of the DT initialized fuzzy sets is combined with similarity based rule base simplification algorithms. The performance of the approach is studied on a specially designed artificial data. An application to the Cancer classification problem is also shown.

The system consists of two major parts. The first one is the ISFER Workbench, which forms a framework for hybrid facial feature detection. Multiple feature detection techniques are applied in parallel. The redundant information is used to define unambiguous face geometry containing no missing or highly inaccurate data. The second part of the system is its inference engine called HERCULES, which converts low level face geometry into high level facial actions, and then this into highest level weighted emotion labels.

A Virtual Document Interpreter for Reuse of Information . The importance of reuse of information is well recognised for electronic publishing. However, it is rarely achieved satisfactorily because of the complexity of the task: integrating different formats, handling updates of information, addressing document author's need for intuitiveness and simplicity, etc. An approach which addresses these problems is to dynamically generate and update documents through a descriptive definition of virtual documents. In this paper we present a document interpreter that allows gathering information from multiple sources, and combining it dynamically to produce a virtual document. Two strengths of our approach are: the generic information objects that we use, which enables access to distributed, heterogeneous data sources; and the interpreter's evaluation strategy, which permits a minimum of re-evaluation of the information objects from the data sources.

Towards UML-based Analysis and Design of Multi-Agent Systems The visual modeling facilities of the UML do not provide sufficient means to support the design of multi-agent systems. In this paper, we are investigating the development phases of requirements analysis, design, and code generation for multi agent systems. In the requirements analysis phase, we are using extended use case diagrams to identify agents and their relationship to the environment. In the design phase, we are using stereotyped class and object diagrams to model different agent types and their related goals and strategies. While these diagrams define the static agent system architecture, dynamic agent behavior is modeled in statecharts with respect to the BDI  1 agent approach. Concerning code generation, we show how the used diagrams can be taken to generate code for CASA, our executable agent specification language that is integrated into an existing multi-agent framework.  1

Improvement in a Lazy Context: An Operational Theory for Call-By-Need The standard implementation technique for lazy functional languages is call-by-need, which ensures that an argument to a function in any given call is evaluated at most once. A significant problem with call-by-need is that it is difficult --- even for compiler writers --- to predict the effects of program transformations. The traditional theories for lazy functional languages are based on call-by-name models, and offer no help in determining which transformations do indeed optimize a program. In this article we present an operational theory for callby -need, based upon an improvement ordering on programs:  M is improved by N if in all program-contexts C,  when C[M ] terminates then C[N ] terminates at least as cheaply. We show that this improvement relation satisfies a "context lemma", and supports a rich inequational theory, subsuming the call-by-need lambda calculi of Ariola et al.  [AFM  +  95]. The reduction-based call-by-need calculi are inadequate as a theory of lazy-program tran...

Maintaining the Illusion of Interacting Within a 3D Virtual Space It is widely thought to more or less a degree, that a sense of presence may be induced in users of new and emerging media technologies, such as, the Internet, digital television and cinema (supporting interaction), teleconferencing and 3D virtual reality systems. In this paper, it is argued that presence presupposes that participants are absorbed in the illusion of interacting within the visual spaces created by these media. That is, prior to the possibility of any inducement of presence, participants need to be absorbed in the illusion conveyed by the media. Without this, participants' attention is broken and the illusion is lost. Hence, the potential to induce presence in participants ceases. To encourage participants to lose sight of the means of representation and be drawn into the illusion conveyed by these media, this paper proposes the development of design principles to increase participants' experience. In an attempt to inform design principles, this paper focuses on another artificial although highly successful visual medium - film. By way of example, this paper concentrates on one medium, virtual reality, and proposes design principles that attempt to maintain the illusion of interacting within 3D virtual space. This attempts to provide a platform through the resourceful blend of hardware and software Virtual Reality (VR) enabling technologies on which to support a well designed virtual environment and hence, from which the inducement of presence in participants may develop.

Proactive Detection of Distributed Denial of Service Attacks using MIB Traffic Variables - A Feasibility Study In this paper we propose a methodology for utilizing Network Management Systems for the early detection of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks. Although there are quite a large number of events that are prior to an attack (e.g. suspicious logons, start of processes, addition of new files, sudden shifts in traffic, etc.), in this work we depend solely on information from MIB (Management Information Base) Traffic Variables collected from the systems participating in the Attack. Three types of DDoS attacks were effected on a Research Test Bed, and MIB variables were recorded. Using these datasets, we show how there are indeed MIB-based precursors of DDoS attacks This work was supported by the Air Force Research Laboratory (Rome, NY - USA) under contract F30602-00-C-0126 to Scientific Systems Company, and by Aprisma's University Fellowship Program 1999/2000. 1 that render it possible to detect them before the Target is shut down.

Logical Update Queries as Open Nested Transactions . The rule-based update language ULTRA has been designed for the  specification of complex database updates in a modular fashion. The logical semantics  of update goals is based on update request sets, which correspond to  deferred basic updates in the database. The declarative character of the logical  semantics leaves much freedom for various evaluation strategies, among them  a top-down resolution, which can be naturally mapped onto a system of nested  transactions. In this paper, we extend this operational model as follows: Not only  the basic operations are performed and committed independently from the toplevel  transaction, but also complex operations defined by update rules. This leads  to an open nested transaction hierarchy, which allows to exploit the semantical  properties of complex operations to gain more concurrency. On the other hand,  high-level compensation is necessary and meta information must be provided by  the programmer. We present the key elements of this combi...

Naive Bayes and Exemplar-Based approaches to Word Sense Disambiguation Revisited . This paper describes an experimental comparison between two standard supervised learning methods, namely Naive Bayes and Exemplar--based classification, on the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem. The aim of the work is twofold. Firstly, it attempts to contribute to clarify some confusing information about the comparison between both methods appearing in the related literature. In doing so, several directions have been explored, including: testing several modifications of the basic learning algorithms and varying the feature space. Secondly, an improvement of both algorithms is proposed, in order to deal with large attribute sets. This modification, which basically consists in using only the positive information appearing in the examples, allows to improve greatly the efficiency of the methods, with no loss in accuracy. The experiments have been performed on the largest sense--tagged corpus available containing the most frequent and ambiguous English words. Results show that the Exemplar-based approach to WSD is generally superior to the Bayesian approach, especially when a specific metric for dealing with symbolic attributes is used.

Learning from Labeled and Unlabeled Data using Graph Mincuts Many application domains suffer from not  having enough labeled training data for  learning. However, large amounts of unlabeled  examples can often be gathered  cheaply. As a result, there has been a great  deal of work in recent years on how unlabeled  data can be used to aid classification. We  consider an algorithm based on finding minimum  cuts in graphs, that uses pairwise relationships  among the examples in order to  learn from both labeled and unlabeled data.

Widening Pos for Efficient and Scalable Groundness Analysis of Logic Programs The domain of positive Boolean functions, Pos, is by now well established for the analysis of the variable dependencies that arise within logic programs. Analyses based on Pos that use binary decision diagrams have been shown to be efficient for a wide range of practical programs. However, independent of the representation, assuming that P != NP , an (unwidened) Pos analysis can never come with any efficiency guarantees because of its potentially explosive behaviour. This paper proposes a simple widening for (goal-dependent) groundness analysis of logic programs that guarantees scalability and efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the widening induces only a very small loss of precision.

Formalisms for Multi-Agent Systems This report is the result of a panel discussion at the First UK Workshop on Foundations of Multi-Agent Systems (FoMAS '96). All members of the panel are authors, listed alphabetically. as knowledge representation language, for direct manipulation within an agent system, is exemplified in the work of Konolige on formalisms for modelling belief, and logic as a programming language is evidenced in the work of Fisher on Concurrent METATEM. All of these strands of work can claim some measure of success. However, a common failing of formal work (both in AI and multi-agent systems) is that its role is not clear. Formal agent theories are agent specifications, not only in the sense of providing descriptions and constraints on agent behaviour, but also in the sense that one understands the term `specification' from mainstream software engineering, namely that they provide a base from which to design, implement and verify agent systems. Agents are a natural next step for software engineering; they represent a fundamentally new way of considering complex distributed systems, containing societies of cooperating autonomous components. If we aim to build such systems, then principled techniques will be required for their design and implementation. We aim to assist the development of such systems by providing formalisms and notations that can be used to specify the desirable behaviour of agents and multi-agent systems; a requirement is that we should be able to move in a principled way from specifications of such systems to implementations. The properties identified by using a formalism serve to measure and evaluate implementations of agent systems. Some properties currently seem to be unimplementable, because they deal with an idealised aspect of agency, such as knowledge. Still, t...

Data Mining for Intelligent Web Caching The paper presents a vertical application of data warehousing and data mining technology: intelligent web caching. We introduce several ways to construct intelligent web caching algorithms that employ predictive models of web requests; the general idea is to extend the LRU policy of web and proxy servers by making it sensible to web access models extracted from web log data using data mining techniques. Two approaches have been studied in particular, one based on association rules and another based on decision trees. The experimental results of the new algorithms show substantial improvement over existing LRUbased caching techniques, in terms of hit rate, i.e., the fraction of web documents directly retrieved in the cache. We designed and developed a prototypical system, which supports data warehousing of web log data, extraction of data mining models and simulation of the web caching algorithms, around an architecture that integrates the various phases in the knowledge discovery process. The system supports a systematic evaluation and benchmarking of the proposed algorithms with respect to existing caching strategies. 1

On Concept Space and Hypothesis Space in Case-Based Learning Algorithms . In order to learn more about the behaviour of case-based reasoners as learning systems, we formalise a simple case-based learner as a PAC learning algorithm. We show that the case-based representation  hCB; oei is rich enough to express any boolean function. We define a family of simple case-based learning algorithms which use a single, fixed similarity measure and we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency of these learning algorithms in terms of the chosen similarity measure. Finally, we consider the way in which these simple algorithms, when trained on target concepts from a restricted concept space, often output hypotheses which are outside the chosen concept space. A case study investigates this relationship between concept space and hypothesis space and concludes that the case-based algorithm studied is a less than optimal learning algorithm for the chosen, small, concept space. 1 Introduction  The performance of a case-based reasoning system [13] will chan...

Learning To Locate An Object in 3D Space From A Sequence Of Camera Images This paper addresses the problem of determining an object's 3D location from a sequence of camera images recorded by a mobile robot. The approach presented here allows people to "train" robots to recognize specific objects, by presenting it examples of the object to be recognized. A decision tree method is used to learn significant features of the target object from individual camera images. Individual estimates are integrated over time using Bayes rule, into a probabilistic 3D model of the robot's environment. Experimental results illustrate that the method enables a mobile robot to robustly estimate the 3D location of objects from multiple camera images. 1 INTRODUCTION  In recent years, there has been significant progress in the field of mobile robotics. Applications such as robots that guide blind or mentally handicapped people, robots that clean large office buildings and department stores, robots that assist people in recreational activities, etc., are slowly getting in reach.

Cooperative Coevolution of Multi-Agent Systems In certain tasks such as pursuit and evasion, multiple agents need to coordinate their behavior to achieve a common goal. An interesting question is, how can such behavior best be evolved? When the agents are controlled with neural networks, a powerful method is to coevolve them in separate subpopulations, and test together in the common task. In this paper, such a method, called Multi-Agent ESP (Enforced Subpopulations) is presented, and demonstrated in a prey-capture task. The approach is shown more efficient and robust than evolving a single central controller for all agents. The role of communication in such domains is also studied, and shown to be unnecessary and even detrimental if effective behavior in the task can be expressed as role-based cooperation rather than synchronization. 1

Combining Labeled and Unlabeled Data with Co-Training We consider the problem of using a large unlabeled sample to boost performance of a learning algorithm when only a small set of labeled examples is available. In particular, we consider a setting in which the description of each example can be partitioned into two distinct views, motivated by the task of learning to classify web pages. For example, the description of a web page can be partitioned into the words occurring on that page, and the words occurring in hyperlinks that point to that page. We assume that either view of the example would be su cient for learning if we had enough labeled data, but our goal is to use both views together to allow inexpensive unlabeled data to augment amuch smaller set of labeled examples. Speci cally, the presence of two distinct views of each example suggests strategies in which two learning algorithms are trained separately on each view, and then each algorithm's predictions on new unlabeled examples are used to enlarge the training set of the other. Our goal in this paper is to provide a PAC-style analysis for this setting, and, more broadly, a PAC-style framework for the general problem of learning from both labeled and unlabeled data. We also provide empirical results on real web-page data indicating that this use of unlabeled examples can lead to signi cant improvement of hypotheses in practice.

Leveled Commitment Contracts and Strategic Breach In automated negotiation systems for self-interested agents, contracts have traditionallybeen binding. Theydo not accommodate future events. Contingency contracts address this, but are often impractical. As an alternative, we propose leÔøΩeled commitment contracts. The level of commitment is set bybreach penalties. To be freed from the contract, an agent simply pays the penalty to the other party. A self-interested agent will be reluctant to breach because the other partymight breach, in which case the former agent is freed from the contract, does not incur a penalty, and collects a penalty from the breacher. We show that, despite such strategic breach, leveled commitment increases the expected payoff to both contract parties and can enable deals that are impossible under full commitment. Asymmetric beliefs are also discussed. Different decommitting mechanisms are introduced and compared. Practical prescriptions for market designers are provided. A contract optimizer is provided on the web. Journal ofEconomic Literature

Embodied Cassie We have enhanced a computational cognitive agent by embodying it with real and simulated bodies operating in real and simulated worlds. This has allowed us to experiment with various ways that embodiment influences the creation and meaning of the agent's beliefs and other terms in its knowledge base, including: symbol-grounding by perception and action; firstperson privileged knowledge; the representation and use of indexicals; having a personal sense of time; and low-level bodily awareness.

Finite-state approaches to Web information extraction Introduction  An information agent is a distributed system that receives a goal through its user interface, gathers information relevant to this goal from a variety of sources, processes this content as appropriate, and delivers the results to the users. We focus on the second stage in this generic architecture. We survey a variety of information extraction techniques that enable information agents to automatically gather information from heterogeneous sources.  For example, consider an agent that mediates package-delivery requests. To satisfy such requests, the agent might need to retrieve address information from geographic services, ask an advertising service for freight forwarders that serve the destination, request quotes from the relevant freight forwarders, retrieve duties and legal constraints from government sites, get weather information to estimate transportation delays, etc.  Information extraction (IE) is a form of shallow document processing that involves populating

It discusseswhat approacheshave been followed (mainly extending existing objectoriented and knowledge engineering methodologies), the suitability of these approaches for agent modelling, and some conclusions drawn from the survey. 1 Introduction Agent technology has received a great deal of attention in the last few years and, as a result, the industry is beginning to get interested in using this technology to develop its own products. In spite of the different developed agent theories, languages, architectures and the successful agent-based applications, very little work for specifying (and applying) techniques to develop applications using agent technology has been done.

Keys for XML this paper. The proposal extends the key speci  cation of XML Data by allowing one to specify keys in terms of XPath [24] expressions. There are a number of technical problems in connection with XPath. XPath is a relatively complex language in which one can not only move down the document tree, but also sideways or upwards, not to mention that predicates and functions can be embedded as well. The problem with XPath is that questions about equivalence or inclusion of XPath expressions are, as far as the authors are aware, unresolved; and these issues are importantifwewant to reason about keys as wedo  in relational databases. Yet until we know how to determine the equivalence of XPath expressions, there is no general method of saying whether two such speci  cations are equivalent. Another technical issue is value equality. XML Schema restricts equality to text, but the authors have encountered cases in whichkeys are not so restricted. See Section 7.1 for a more detailed discussion. However, the main reason for writing this paper is that none of the existing key proposals address the issue of hierarchical keys, which appear to be ubiquitous in hierarchically structured databases, especially in scienti  c data formats. A top-level key may be used to identify components of a document, and within each component a secondary key is used to identify sub-components, and so on. Moreover, the authors believe that the use of keys for citing parts of a document is suciently important that it is appropriate to consider key speci  cation independently of other proposals for constraining the structure of XML documents

An asymptotic analysis of AdaBoost in the binary classification case Recent work has shown that combining multiple versions of weak classifiers such as decision trees or neural networks results in reduced test set error. To study this in greater detail, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of AdaBoost type algorithms. The theoretical analysis establishes the relation between the distribution of margins of the training examples and the generated voting classification rule. The paper shows asymptotic experimental results for the binary classification case underlining the theoretical findings. Finally, the relation between the model complexity and noise in the training data, and how to improve AdaBoost type algorithms in practice are discussed. 1 Introduction  An ensemble is a collection of neural networks or other types of classifiers (predictors) that are trained for the same task.

Hierarchical Models for Screening of Iron Deficiency Anemia We investigate the problem of classifying individuals based on estimated density functions for each individual. The problem is similar to conventional classification in that there is labelled training data, but different in that the underlying measurements are not feature vectors but histograms or density estimates. We describe a general framework based on probabilistic hierarchical models for modelling such data and illustrate how the model lends itself to classification. We contrast this approach with two other alternatives: (1) directly defining distance between densities using a cross-entropy distance measure, and (2) using parameters of the estimated densities as feature vectors for a standard discriminative classification framework. We evaluate all three methods on a realworld medical diagnosis problem. The hierarchical modeling and density-distance approaches are most accurate, yielding crossvalidated error rates in the range of 1 to 2%. We conclude by discussing the relative me...

Constructing Qualitative Event Models Automatically from Video Input We describe an implemented technique for generating event models automatically based on qualitative reasoning and a statistical analysis of video input. Using an existing tracking program which generates labelled contours for objects in every frame, the view from a fixed camera is partitioned into semantically relevant regions based on the paths followed by moving objects. The paths are indexed with temporal information so objects moving along the same path at different speeds can be distinguished. Using a notion of proximity based on the speed of the moving objects and qualitative spatial reasoning techniques, event models describing the behaviour of pairs of objects can be built, again using statistical methods. The system has been tested on a traffic domain and learns various event models expressed in the qualitative calculus which represent human observable events. The system can then be used to recognise subsequent selected event occurrences or unusual behaviours. 1 Introduction D...

Secure Dynamic Reconfiguration of Scalable CORBA Systems with Mobile Agents . As various Internet services, electronic commerce, and information and communication systems permeate our lives, their continual availability becomes a dominant issue. But continuing software evolution requires system recon guration. Running systems must upgrade their components or change their con guration parameters. In addition, Internet services often need to serve thousands or millions of users. This scenario raises three conicting issues that need to be resolved: availability, con gurability, and scalability. We propose the use of mobile recon guration agents for the ecient, secure, and scalable dynamic recon guration of Internet systems. In our system, the agents are deployed within the object-oriented architecture of a CORBA-compliant ORB that supports safe recon guration both of its middleware engine and of user applications.

An Approach to Relate the Web Communities Through Bipartite Graphs The Web harbors a large number of community structures. Early detection of community structures has many purposes such as reliable searching and selective advertising. In this paper we investigate the problem of extracting and relating the web community structures from a large collection of Web-pages by performing hyper-link analysis. The proposed algorithm extracts the potential community signatures by extracting the corresponding dense bipartite graph (DBG) structures from the given data set of web pages. Further, the proposed algorithm can also be used to relate the extracted community signatures. We report the experimental results conducted on 10 GB TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) data collection that contains 1.7 million pages and 21.5 million links. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach extracts meaningful community signatures and relates them.

Discovery of Similarity Computations of Search Engines Two typical situations in which it is of practical interest to determine the similarities of text documents to a query due to a search engine are: (1) a global search engine, constructed on top of a group of local search engines, wishes to retrieve the set of local documents globally most similar to a given query; and (2) an organization wants to compare the retrieval performance of search engines. The dot-product function is a widely used similarity function. For a search engine using such a function, we can determine its similarity computations if how the search engine sets the weights of terms is known, which is usually not the case. In this paper, techniques are presented to discover certain mathematical expressions of these formulas and the values of embedded constants when the dot-product similarity function is used. Preliminary results from experiments on the WebCrawler search engine are given to illustrate our techniques.  1  Categories and Subject Descriptors  H.3 [Information...

A particular emphasis is placed on using some of the mechanisms of emotions as building blocks for the acquisition of emotional memories that serve as biasing signals during the process of making decisions and selecting actions. We have successfully followed this approach to develop and control several different autonomous agents, including both synthetic agents and physical robots.

Definition And Analysis Of Index Organizations For Object-Oriented Database Systems The efficient execution of queries in object-oriented databases requires the design of specific indexing techniques, to efficiently deal with predicates against nested attributes or against class inheritance hierarchies. Indexing techniques so far proposed can be classified into three groups: inheritance indexing techniques, whose goal is to support queries along inheritance hierarchies; aggregation indexing techniques, dealing with the efficient evaluation of nested predicates; integrated techniques. The aim of this paper is to analyze two techniques providing an integrated support, the path index and the nested-inherited index, with respect to traditional techniques, such as the multi-index and the inherited multi-index. The analysis is performed assuming that multi-valued attributes, as well as instances with null attribute values, are present in the database. For this purpose, the paper first presents the considered techniques. An extension of the path index, firstly defined in [6]...

By analyzing the  clusters formed by these vectors, we can assign the documents within the same  cluster to the same class automatically. Our contributions are the following: (1)  We propose a feature extraction mechanism which is more suitable to Web page  classification. (2) We introduce a tree structure called the DC-tree to make the  clustering process incremental and less sensitive to the document insertion order.

A Reliable Multicast Protocol for Distributed Mobile Systems: Design and Evaluation Abstract Reliable multicast is a powerful communication primitive for structuring distributed programs in which multiple processes must closely cooperate together. In this paper we propose a protocol for supporting reliable multicast in a distributed system that includes mobile hosts and evaluate the performance of our proposal through simulation. We consider a scenario in which mobile hosts communicate with a wired infrastructure by means of wireless technology. Our proposal provides several novel features. The sender of each multicast may select among three increasingly strong delivery ordering guarantees: FIFO, Causal, Total. Movements do not trigger the transmission of any message in the wired network as no notion of hand-off is used. The set of senders and receivers (group) may be dynamic. Size of data structures at mobile hosts, size of message headers, number of messages in the wired network for each multicast, are all independent on the number of group members. The wireless network is assumed to provide only incomplete spatial coverage and message losses could occur even within cells. Movements are not negotiated and a mobile host that leaves a cell may enter any other cell, perhaps after a potentially long disconnection. The simulation results show that the proposed protocol has good performance and good scalability properties. 1

Loglinear Models for First-Order Probabilistic Reasoning Recent work on loglinear models in probabilistic constraint logic programming is applied to first-order probabilistic reasoning. Probabilities are defined directly on the  proofs of atomic formulae, and by marginalisation on the atomic formulae themselves. We use Stochastic Logic Programs (SLPs) composed of labelled and unlabelled definite clauses to define the proof probabilities. We have a conservative extension of first-order reasoning, so that, for example, there is a one-one mapping between logical and random variables. We show how, in this framework, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) can be used to induce the features of a loglinear model from data. We also compare the presented framework with other approaches to first-order probabilistic reasoning. Keywords: loglinear models, constraint logic programming, inductive logic programming  1 Introduction  A framework which merges first-order logical and probabilistic inference in a theoretically sound and applicable manner promises ma...

A Cost-Based Object Buffer Replacement Algorithm for Object-Oriented Database Systems Many object-oriented database systems manage object buffers to provide fast access to objects. Traditional buffer replacement algorithms based on fixed-length pages simply assume that the cost incurred by operating a buffer is proportional to the number of buffer faults. However, this assumption no longer holds in an object buffer where objects are of variable-lengths and the cost of replacing an object varies for each object. In this paper, we propose a cost-based replacement algorithm for object buffers. The proposed algorithm replaces the objects that have minimum costs per unit time and unit space. The cost model extends the previous page-based one to include the replacement costs and the sizes of objects. The performance tests show that the proposed algorithm is almost always superior to the LRU-2 algorithm and in some cases is more than twice as fast. The idea of cost-based replacement can be applied to any buffer management architectures that adopt earlier algorithms. It is espe...

An Agent-Based Approach for Manufacturing Integration - The CIIMPLEX Experience The production management system used by most manufacturers today is comprised of disconnected planning and execution processes, and lacks the support for interoperability and collaboration needed for enterprise-wide integration. This situation often prevents the manufacturer from fully exploring market opportunities in a timely fashion. To address this problem, we are exploring an agent-based approach to intelligent enterprise integration. In this approach, a set of agents with specialized expertise can be quickly assembled to help with the gathering of relevant information and knowledge, to cooperate with each other and with other parts of the production management system and humans to arrive at timely decisions in dealing with various enterprise scenarios. The proposed multi-agent system, including its architecture and implementation, are presented and demonstrated through an example integration scenario involving real planning and execution software systems.  1.

A Web Odyssey: from Codd to XML INTRODUCTION  The Web presents the database area with vast opportunities and commensurate challenges. Databases and the Web are organically connected at many levels. Web sites are increasingly powered by databases. Collections of linked Web pages distributed across the Internet are themselves tempting targets for a database. The emergence of XML as the lingua franca of the Web brings some much needed order and will greatly facilitate the use of database techniques to manage Web information.  This paper will discuss some of the developments related to the Web from the viewpoint of database theory. As we shall see, the Web scenario requires revisiting some of the basic assumptions of the area. To be sure, database theory remains as valid as ever in the classical setting, and the database industry will continue to representamulti-billion dollar target of applicability for the foreseeable future.

Constrained Nearest Neighbor Queries In this paper we introduce the notion of constrained nearest neighbor queries (CNN) and propose a  series of methods to answer them. This class of queries can be thought of as nearest neighbor queries with  range constraints. Although both nearest neighbor and range queries have been analyzed extensively in  previous literature, the implications of constrained nearest neighbor queries have not been discussed. Due  to their versatility, CNN queries are suitable to a wide range of applications from GIS systems to reverse  nearest neighbor queries and multimedia applications. We develop methods for answering CNN queries  with different properties and advantages. We prove the optimality (with respect to I/O cost) of one of the  techniques proposed in this paper. The superiority of the proposed technique is shown by a performance  analysis.  1 Introduction  Two dimensional range queries are used frequently in various applications such as spatial databases [Sam89,  GG98] and Geographic Infor...

Context and Page Analysis for Improved Web Search NEC Research Institute has developed a metasearch engine that improves the efficiency of Web searches by downloading and analyzing each document and then displaying results that show the query terms in context. Several popular and useful search engines such as AltaVista, Excite, HotBot, Infoseek, Lycos, and Northern Light attempt to maintain full-text indexes of the World Wide Web. However, relying on a single standard search engine has limitations. The standard search engines have limited coverage, 1,2 outdated databases, and are sometimes unavailable due to problems with the network or the engine itself. The precision of standard engine results can also vary because they generally focus on handling queries quickly and use relatively simple ranking schemes. 3 Rankings can be further muddled by keyword spamming to increase a page's rank order. Often, the relevance of a particular page is obvious only after loading it and finding the query terms. Metasearch engines, such as MetaCrawler and SavvySearch, attempt to contend with the problem of limited coverage by submitting queries to several standard search engines at once. 4,5 The primary advantages of metasearch engines are that they combine the results of several search engines and present a consistent user interface. 5 However, most metasearch engines rely on the documents and summaries returned by standard search engines and so inherit their limited precision and vulnerability to keyword spamming. We developed the NEC Research Institute (NECI) metasearch engine [now called Inquirus] to improve the efficiency and precision of Web search by downloading and analyzing each document and then displaying results that show the query terms in

Tailoring the Interaction with Users in Web Stores . We describe the user modeling and personalization techniques adopted in SETA, a prototype toolkit for the construction of adaptive Web stores which customize the interaction with users. The Web stores created using SETA suggest the items best fitting the customers' needs and adapt the layout and the description of the store catalog to their preferences and expertise.  SETA uses stereotypical information to handle the user models and applies personalization rules to dynamically generate the hypertextual pages presenting products. The system adapts the graphical aspect, length and terminology used in the descriptions to parameters like the user's receptivity, expertise and interests. Moreover, it maintains a model associated with each person the goods are selected for; in this way, multiple criteria can be applied for tailoring the selection of items to the preferences of their beneficiaries.

A Multi-Agent System for Emergent Process Management A multi-agent system manages emergent business processes.  The agents in this system all have the same generic  architecture. The generic agent architecture is a three-layer  BDI, hybrid, multi-agent architecture. The architecture copes  with plans whose goals develop and mutate. The agents in the  system choose their course of action on the basis of estimates  of the likelihood of a choice leading to success, and on  estimates of the time, cost and value of making a choice.  1 Introduction  Emergent processes are business processes; they are distinct from production workflows [1]. Emergent processes are opportunistic in nature whereas production workflows are routine. Emergent processes are inherently distributed and involve asynchronous parallel work. What amounts to a "satisfactory conclusion" of an emergent process is not generally known until the process is well advanced. Further, the tasks involved in an emergent process are typically not predefined and emerge as the process deve...

Goal Directed Adaptive Behavior in Second-Order Neural Networks: Leaning and Evolving in the MAXSON architecture The paper presents a neural network architecture (MAXSON) based on second-order connections that can learn a multiple goal approach/avoid task using reinforcement from the environment. It also enables an agent to learn vicariously, from the successes and failures of other agents. The paper shows that MAXSON can learn certain spatial navigation tasks much faster than traditional Q-learning, as well as learn goal directed behavior, increasing the agent's chances of long-term survival. The paper shows that an extension of MAXSON (V-MAXSON) enables agents to learn vicariously, and this improves the overall survivability of the agent population.

The resulting framework aims to unify Constraint Logic Programming (CLP), Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) and Semantic Query Optimisation (SQO) in deductive databases.

Restricted Bayes Optimal Classifiers We introduce the notion of restricted Bayes optimal classifiers. These classifiers attempt to combine the flexibility of the generative approach to classification with the high accuracy associated with discriminative learning. They first create a model of the joint distribution over class labels and features. Instead of choosing the decision boundary induced directly from the model, they restrict the allowable types of decision boundaries and learn the one that minimizes the probability of misclassification relative to the estimated joint distribution. In this paper, we investigate two particular instantiations of this approach. The first uses a non-parametric density estimator ‚Äî Parzen Windows with Gaussian kernels ‚Äî and hyperplane decision boundaries. We show that the resulting classifier is asymptotically equivalent to a maximal margin hyperplane classifier, a highly successful discriminative classifier. We therefore provide an alternative justification for maximal margin hyperplane classifiers. The second instantiation uses a mixture of Gaussians as the estimated density; in experiments on real-world data, we show that this approach allows data with missing values to be handled in a principled manner, leading to improved performance over regular discriminative approaches.

We apply these principles in the implementation of a multimodal prototype system, the Infocockpit (for "Information Cockpit"). The Infocockpit not only uses multiple monitors surrounding the user to engage human memory for location, but also provides ambient visual and auditory displays to engage human memory for place. We report a user study demonstrating a 56% increase in memory for information presented with our Infocockpit system as compared to a standard desktop system.

Discovering Fuzzy Classification Rules with Genetic Programming and Co-Evolution In essence, data mining consists of extracting knowledge from  data. This paper proposes a co-evolutionary system for discovering fuzzy  classification rules. The system uses two evolutionary algorithms: a genetic  programming (GP) algorithm evolving a population of fuzzy rule sets and a  simple evolutionary algorithm evolving a population of membership function  definitions. The two populations co-evolve, so that the final result of the coevolutionary  process is a fuzzy rule set and a set of membership function  definitions which are well adapted to each other. In addition, our system also  has some innovative ideas with respect to the encoding of GP individuals representing  rule sets. The basic idea is that our individual encoding scheme incorporates  several syntactical restrictions that facilitate the handling of rule  sets in disjunctive normal form. We have also adapted GP operators to better  work with the proposed individual encoding scheme.

Architecture for Agent Programming Languages .  As the field of agent-based systems continues to expand rapidly, one of the most significant problems lies in being able to compare and evaluate the relative benefits and disadvantages of different systems. In part, this is due to the various different ways in which these systems are presented. One solution is to develop a set of architectural building blocks that can be used as a basis for further construction (to avoid re-inventing wheels), and to ensure a strong and effective, yet simple and accessible, means of presentation that allows for comparison and analysis of agent systems. In this paper, we address this issue in providing just such an architectural framework by using the 3APL agent programming language as a starting point for identification and specification of more general individual agent components. This provides three additional benefits: it moves the work further down the road of implementation, contributes to a growing library of agent techniques and features, and allows a detailed comparison of different agent-based systems specified in similar ways.  1

Subpixel Localization and Uncertainty Estimation Using Occupancy Grids We describe techniques for performing mobile robot localization using occupancy grids that allow subpixel localization and uncertainty estimation in the pixelized pose space. The techniques are based on a localization method where matching is performed between the visible landmarks at the current robot position and a previously generated map of the environment. A likelihood function over the space of possible robot positions is formulated as a function of the probability distribution for the map matching error. Subpixel localization and uncertainty estimation are performed by fitting the likelihood function with a parameterized surface. The performance of the method is analyzed using synthetic experiments and an example is given using the Rocky 7 Mars rover prototype.  1 Introduction  Localization is a critical issue in mobile robotics.

A Fuzzy Beam-Search Rule Induction Algorithm . This paper proposes a fuzzy beam search rule induction algorithm for the classification task. The use of fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets not only provides us with a powerful, flexible approach to cope with uncertainty, but also allows us to express the discovered rules in a representation more intuitive and comprehensible for the user, by using linguistic terms (such as low, medium, high) rather than continuous, numeric values in rule conditions. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in two public domain data sets. 1 Introduction  This paper addresses the classification task. In this task the goal is to discover a relationship between a goal attribute, whose value is to be predicted, and a set of predicting attributes. The system discovers this relationship by using known-class examples, and the discovered relationship is then used to predict the goal-attribute value (or the class) of unknown-class examples. There are numerous rule induction algorithms for the classification task. However, ...

A Plan Fusion Algorithm for Multi-Agent Systems We introduce an algorithm for cooperative planning in multi-agent systems. The algorithm enables the agents to combine (fuse) their plans in order to increase their joint profits. A computational resources and skills framework is developed for representing the planned activities of an agent under time constraints. Using this resource-skill framework, we present an ecient (polynomial time) algorithm that fuses the plans of a group of agents in such a way that their joint profits improve. The framework and the algorithm are illustrated using a simplified example from the freight transport domain. 1 Introduction Recently, much attention has been given to the topic of cooperation and cooperative planning in multiagent systems.

A Methodology for Using Intelligent Agents to provide Automated Intrusion Response This paper proposes a new methodology for adaptive, automated intrusion response (IR) using software agents. The majority of intrusion response systems (IRSs) react to attacks by generating reports or alarms. This introduces a window of vulnerability between when an intrusion is detected and when action is taken to defend against the attack. Research by Cohen indicates that the success of an attack is dependent on the time gap between detection and response. If skilled attackers are given ten hours after they are detected and before a response, they will be successful 80% of the time. At thirty hours, the attacker almost never fails [1]. The proposed methodology addresses this window of vulnerability by providing an automated response to incidents using a heterogeneous collection of software agents. These agents collaborate to protect the computer system against attack and adapt their response tactics until the system administrator can take an active role in the defense of the system.

Algorithm for Optimal Winner Determination in Combinatorial Auctions Combinatorial auctions, i.e. auctions where bidders can bid on com-binations of items, tend to lead to more e cient allocations than tra-ditional auctions in multi-item auctions where the agents ' valuations of the items are not additive. However, determining the winners so as to maximize revenue is NP-complete. First, existing approaches for tackling this problem are reviewed: exhaustive enumeration, dynamic programming, approximation algorithms, and restricting the allow-able combinations. Then we present our search algorithm for optimal winner determination. Experiments are shown on several bid distri-butions. The algorithm allows combinatorial auctions to scale up to signi cantly larger numbers of items and bids than prior approaches to optimal winner determination by capitalizing on the fact that the space of bids is necessarily sparsely populated in practice. The algo-rithm does this by provably su cient selective generation of children in the search tree, by using a secondary search for fast child genera-tion, by heuristics that are accurate and optimized for speed, and by four methods for preprocessing the search space. Patent pending. A highly optimized implementation of the algorithm is available for licensing both for research and commercial purposes. Please contact the author. 1 1

Database Query Formation from Natural Language using Semantic Modeling and Statistical Keyword Meaning Disambiguation This paper describes a natural language interface to database systems which is based on the query formation capabilities of a High-level Query Formulator. The formulator relies on the Semantic Graph of the database, which is a model of the data stored in the database. The natural language interface accepts a user input in natural language and extracts the necessary information needed by the formulator. This extraction process is performed using keywords obtained from the Semantic Graph and the database. Because keywords may have several meanings within a given domain, keyword meaning disambiguation is done using a statistical approach which involves comparing vectors of n-grams. N-grams are n contiguous words within a given text of natural language and they are capable of capturing lexical context. Traditionally, natural language interfaces have been heavy with grammars and other knowledge, but have been wide-ranging in functionality. The interface presented in this paper is more porta...

Transactional Coordination Agents for Composite Systems Composite systems are collections of autonomous, heterogeneous, and distributed software applications. In these systems, data dependencies are continuously violated by local operations and therefore, coordination processes are necessary to guarantee overall correctness and consistency.

However, this functionality is not present in many applications and must be implemented by a transactional coordination agent coupled with the application.

An Introduction to Variational Methods for Graphical Methods . This paper presents a tutorial introduction to the use of variational methods for inference and learning in graphical models (Bayesian networks and Markov random fields). We present a number of examples of graphical models, including the QMR-DT database, the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine, and several variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated in each case.

We introduce two new logical bidding languages for combinatorial markets: the XOR bidding language and the OR-of-XORs bidding language. Unlike the traditional OR bidding language, these are fully expressive. They therefore enable the use of the Clarke-Groves pricing mechanism for motivating the bidders to bid truthfully. eAuctionHouse also supports supply/demand curve bidding. eCommitter, the leveled commitment contract optimizer, determines the optimal contract price and decommitting penalties for a variety of leveled commitment contracting mechanisms, taking into account that rational agents will decommit strategically in Nash equilibrium. It also determines the optimal decommitting strategies for any given leveled commitment contract. eExchangeHouse, the safe exchange planner, enables unenforced anonymous exchanges by dividing the exchange into chunks and sequencing those chunks to be delivered safely in alternation between the buyer and the seller.

Programming Satan's Agents Mobile agent security is still a young discipline and most naturally, the focus up to the time of writing was on inventing new cryptographic protocols for securing various aspects of mobile agents. However, past experience shows that protocols can be flawed, and flaws in protocols can remain unnoticed for a long period of time. The game of breaking and fixing protocols is a necessary evolutionary process that leads to a better understanding of the underlying problems and ultimately to more robust and secure systems. Although, to the best of our knowledge, little work has been published on breaking protocols for mobile agents, it is inconceivable that the multitude of protocols proposed so far are all flawless. As it turns out, the opposite is true. We identify flaws in protocols proposed by Corradi et al., Karjoth et al., and Karnik et al., including protocols based on secure coprocessors.

Layered  learning applies to tasks for which learning  a direct mapping from inputs to outputs  is intractable with existing learning algorithms.

We show that query modifications to web search engines increase the probability that the documents returned are of the specific category.  We evaluate the effectiveness of several query modifications on real search engines, showing that the approach is highly effective for locating personal homepages and calls for papers.  1: Introduction  Typical web search engines index millions of pages across a variety of categories, and return results ranked by expected topical relevance. Only a small percentage of these pages may be of a specific category, for example, personal homepages, or calls for papers. A user may examine large numbers of pages abou...

PeerWare: Core Middleware Support for Peer-to-Peer and Mobile Systems The pervasiveness of computer networks, together with the availability of wireless links, are steering distributed systems towards scenarios where computing is increasingly decentralized, decoupled, and dynamically reconfigurable. The popularity of and demand for applications that exploit mobile and peer-to-peer interactions is a symptom of such change. Nevertheless, by and large these applications are being built in an ad hoc manner, and often with architectures that, by sticking to the traditional client-server paradigm, do not fully capture and support the peculiar requirements of the new scenario.

Genetic Algorithms for Binary Quadratic Programming In this paper, genetic algorithms for the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (BQP) are presented. It is shown that for small problems a simple genetic algorithm with uniform crossover is sufficient to find optimum or best-known solutions in short time, while for problems with a high number of variables (n  200) it is essential to incorporate local search to arrive at high-quality solutions. A hybrid genetic algorithm incorporating local search is tested on 40 problem instances of sizes containing between n = 200 and n = 2500. The results of the computer experiments show that the approach is comparable to alternative heuristics such as tabu search for small instances and superior to tabu search and simulated annealing for large instances. New best solutions could be found for 14 large problem instances. 1 INTRODUCTION  In the unconstrained binary quadratic programming problem (BQP), a symmetric rational n \Theta n matrix  Q = (q ij ) is given, and a binary vector of leng...

AL-log: Integrating Datalog and Description Logics . We presentanintegrated system for knowledge representation, called AL-log, based on description logics and the deductive database language Datalog. AL-log embodies two subsystems, called structural and relational. The former allows for the de#nition of structural knowledge about classes of interest #concepts# and membership relation between objects and classes. The latter allows for the de#nition of relational knowledge about objects described in the structural component. The interaction between the two components is obtained by allowing constraints within Datalog clauses, thus requiring the variables in the clauses to range over the set of instances of a speci#ed concept. We propose a method for query answering in AL-log based on constrained resolution, where the usual deduction procedure de#ned for Datalog is integrated with a method for reasoning on the structural knowledge.

The String B-Tree: A New Data Structure for String Search in External Memory and its Applications. We introduce a new text-indexing data structure, the String B-Tree, that can be seen as a link between some traditional external-memory and string-matching data structures. In a short phrase, it is a combination of B-trees and Patricia tries for internal-node indices that is made more effective by adding extra pointers to speed up search and update operations. Consequently, the String B-Tree overcomes the theoretical limitations of inverted files, B-trees, prefix B-trees, suffix arrays, compacted tries and suffix trees. String B-trees have the same worst-case performance as B-trees but they manage unbounded-length strings and perform much more powerful search operations such as the ones supported by suffix trees. String B-trees are also effective in main memory (RAM model) because they improve the online suffix tree search on a dynamic set of strings. They also can be successfully applied to database indexing and software duplication.

FEATURES: Real-time Adaptive Feature Learning and Document Learning for Web Search In this paper we report our research on building Features - an intelligent web search engine that is able to perform real-time adaptive feature (i.e., keyword) and document learning. Not only does Features learn from the user's document relevance feedback, but also automatically extracts and suggests indexing keywords relevant to a search query and learns from the user's keyword relevance feedback so that it is able to speed up its search process and to enhance its search performance. We design two efficient and mutual-benefiting learning algorithms that work concurrently, one for feature learning and the other for document learning. Features employs these algorithms together with an internal index database and a real-time meta-searcher so to perform adaptive real-time learning to find desired documents with as little relevance feedback from the user as possible. The architecture and performance of Features are also discussed. 1 Introduction As the world wide web rapidly evo...

Social Mental Shaping: Modelling the Impact of Sociality on the Mental States of Autonomous Agents This paper presents a framework that captures how the social nature of agents that are situated in a multi-agent environment impacts upon their individual mental states. Roles and social relationships provide an abstraction upon which we develop the notion of social mental shaping. This allows us to extend the standard Belief-DesireIntention model to account for how common social phenomena (e.g. cooperation, collaborative problem-solving and negotiation) can be integrated into a unified theoretical perspective that reflects a fully explicated model of the autonomous agent's mental state.

The Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy : A New Baseline Algorithm for Pareto Multiobjective Optimisation Most popular evolutionary algorithms for multiobjective optimisation maintain a population of solutions from which individuals are selected for reproduction. In this paper, we introduce a simpler evolution scheme for multiobjective problems, called the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES). We argue that PAES may represent the simplest possible non-trivial algorithm capable of generating diverse solutions in the Pareto optimal set. The algorithm is identified as being a (1 + 1) evolution strategy, using local search from a population of one but using a reference archive of previously found solutions in order to identify the approximate dominance ranking of the current and candidate solution vectors. PAES is intended as a good baseline approach, against which more involved methods may be compared, and may also serve well in some real-world applications when local search seems superior to or competitive with population-based methods. The performance of the new algorithm is compared w...

Text Categorization Using Weight Adjusted k-Nearest Neighbor Classification . Automatic text categorization is an important task that can  help people finding information on huge online resources. Text categorization  presents unique challenges due to the large number of attributes  present in the data set, large number of training samples, attribute dependency,  and multi-modality of categories. Existing classification techniques  have limited applicability in the data sets of these natures. In this  paper, we present a Weight Adjusted k-Nearest Neighbor (WAKNN)  classification that learns feature weights based on a greedy hill climbing  technique. We also present two performance optimizations of WAKNN  that improve the computational performance by a few orders of magnitude,  but do not compromise on the classification quality. We experimentally  evaluated WAKNN on 52 document data sets from a variety  of domains and compared its performance against several classification  algorithms, such as C4.5, RIPPER, Naive-Bayesian, PEBLS and VSM.

Mining the Web to Create Minority Language Corpora The Web is a valuable source of language specific resources but the process of collecting, organizing and utilizing these resources is difficult. We describe CorpusBuilder, an approach for automatically generating Web-search queries for collecting documents in a minority language. It differs from pseudo-relevance feedback in that retrieved documents are labeled by an automatic language classifier as relevant or irrelevant, and this feedback is used to generate new queries. We experiment with various query-generation methods and query-lengths to find inclusion/exclusion terms that are helpful  for retrieving documents in the target language and find that using odds-ratio scores calculated over the documents acquired so far was one of the most consistently accurate query-generation methods. We also describe experiments using a handful of words elicited from a user instead of initial documents and show that the methods perform similarly. Experiments applying the same approach to multiple languages are also presented showing that our approach generalizes to a variety of languages.  1.

Enhancing Supervised Learning with Unlabeled Data In many practical learning scenarios, there is  a small amount of labeled data along with  a large pool of unlabeled data. Many supervised  learning algorithms have been developed  and extensively studied. We present  a new "co-training" strategy for using unlabeled  data to improve the performance  of standard supervised learning algorithms.  Unlike much of the prior work, such as the  co-training procedure of Blum and Mitchell  (1998), we do not assume there are two redundant  views both of which are sufficient for  perfect classification. The only requirement  our co-training strategy places on each supervised  learning algorithm is that its hypothesis  partitions the example space into a set of  equivalence classes (e.g. for a decision tree  each leaf defines an equivalence class). We  evaluate our co-training strategy via experiments  using data from the UCI repository.  1.

Spatial Agents Implemented in a Logical Expressible Language In this paper, we present a multi-layered architecture  for spatial and temporal agents. The focus is  laid on the declarativity of the approach, which  makes agent scripts expressive and well understandable.  They can be realized as (constraint) logic  programs. The logical description language is able  to express actions or plans for one and more autonomous  and cooperating agents for the RoboCup  (Simulator League). The system architecture hosts  constraint technology for qualitative spatial reasoning,  but quantitative data is taken into account, too.  The basic (hardware) layer processes the agent's  sensor information. An interface transfers this lowlevel  data into a logical representation. It provides  facilities to access the preprocessed data and supplies  several basic skills. The second layer performs  (qualitative) spatial reasoning. On top of this, the  third layer enables more complex skills such as  passing, offside-detection etc. At last, the fourth  layer establishes acting as a team both by emergent  and explicit cooperation. Logic and deduction provide  a clean means to specify and also to implement  teamwork behavior.  1

A Parametric Alternative to Grids for Occupancy-Based World Modeling In the paper, we consider an occupancy-based approach for range data fusion, as it is used in mobile robotics. We tackle the major problem of this approach, which is the redundancy of stored and processed data caused by using the grid representation of the occupancy function, by proposing a parametric piece-wise linear representation. When applied to the vision-based world exploration, the new representation is shown to have advantages over the former one, which include its suitability for radial range data, its efficiency in representing and fusing range data, and its convenience for navigation map extraction. The proposed technique is implemented on a mobile robot, Boticelli. The results obtained from running the robot are presented. 1 Introduction  In mobile robot world exploration, the occupancybased  approach is one of the most commonly used [7, 13, 3, 2, 8, 4, 11]. In this approach, the exploration policy is determined by the occupancy model of the world which is built from the r...

Implementation and Performance Analysis of Incremental Equations of Nested Relations View materialization is an important way of improving the  performance of query processing. When an update occurs to  the source data from which a materialized view is derived, the  materialized view has to be updated so that it is consistent  with the source data. This update process is called view maintenance.  The incremental method of view maintenance, which  computes the new view using the old view and the update to  the source data, is widely preferred to full view recomputation  when the update is small in size. The small update size  becomes an important concept for measuring the cheap performance  of the incremental methods. In this paper, we investigate  what is the limit of the small update size, which we call  size limit for the incremental maintenance. When the size of  an update exceeds the limit, the incremental maintenance is no  longer cheaper than the view recomputation. The investigation  is based on incremental equations for operators in the nested  relational model...

ACIRD: Intelligent Internet Documents Organization and Retrieval This paper presents an intelligent Internet information system, Automatic Classifier for the Internet Resource Discovery (ACIRD), which uses machine learning techniques to organize and retrieve Internet documents. ACIRD consists of a knowledge acquisition process, document classifier and two-phase search engine. The knowledge acquisition process of ACIRD automatically learns classification knowledge from classified Internet documents. The document classifier applies learned classification knowledge to classify newly collected Internet documents into one or more classes. Experimental results indicate that ACIRD performs as well or better than human experts in both knowledge acquisition and document classification. By using the learned classification knowledge and the given class lattice, the ACIRD two-phase search engine responds to user queries with hierarchically structured navigable results (instead of a conventional flat ranked document list), which greatly aids users in locating information from numerous, diversified Internet documents.

Locality in Search Engine Queries and Its Implications for Caching Caching is a popular technique for reducing both server load and user response time in distributed systems. In this paper, we are interested in the question of whether caching might be effective for search engines as well. We study two real search engine traces by examining query locality and its implications for caching. Our trace analysis results show that: (1) Queries have significant locality, with query frequency following a Zipf distribution. Very popular queries are shared among different users and can be cached at servers or proxies, while 16 % to 22% of the queries are from the same users and should be cached at the user side. Multiple-word queries are shared less and should be cached mainly at the user side. (2) If caching is to be done at the user side, short-term caching for hours will be enough to cover query temporal locality, while server/proxy caching should be based on longer periods such as days. (3) Most users have small lexicons when submitting queries. Frequent users who submit many search requests tend to reuse a small subset of words to form queries. Thus, with proxy or user side caching, prefetching based on user lexicon looks promising.

In a multi-agent system, the local problem solving control of an agent can interact in complex and intricate ways with the problem solving control of other agents. In such systems, an agent cannot make effective control decisions based purely on its local problem solving state. Effective cooperation requires that the global problem-solving state influence the local control decisions made by an agent. We call such an influence cooperative control.

Uncertain Knowledge Representation and Communicative Behavior in Coordinated Defense This paper reports on results we obtained on communication among artificial and human agents interacting in a simulated air defense domain. In our research, we postulate that the artificial agents use a decision-theoretic method to select optimal communicative acts, given the characteristics of the particular situation. Thus, the agents we implemented compute the expected utilities of various alternative communicative acts, and execute the best one. The agents use a probabilistic frame-based knowledge formalism to represent the uncertain information they have about the domain and about the other agents present.

In this domain, distributed units coordinate and communicate to defend a specified territory from a number of attacking missiles.

An Automatic Closed-Loop Methodology for Generating Character Groundtruth for Scanned Documents Abstract‚ÄîCharacter groundtruth for real, scanned document images is crucial for evaluating the performance of OCR systems, training OCR algorithms, and validating document degradation models. Unfortunately, manual collection of accurate groundtruth for characters in a real (scanned) document image is not practical because (i) accuracy in delineating groundtruth character bounding boxes is not high enough, (ii) it is extremely laborious and time consuming, and (iii) the manual labor required for this task is prohibitively expensive. In this paper we describe a closed-loop methodology for collecting very accurate groundtruth for scanned documents. We first create ideal documents using a typesetting language. Next we create the groundtruth for the ideal document. The ideal document is then printed, photocopied and then scanned. A registration algorithm estimates the global geometric transformation and then performs a robust local bitmap match to register the ideal document image to the scanned document image. Finally, groundtruth associated with the ideal document image is transformed using the estimated geometric transformation to create the groundtruth for the scanned document image. This methodology is very general and can be used for creating groundtruth for documents in typeset in any language, layout, font, and style. We have demonstrated the method by generating groundtruth for English, Hindi, and FAX document images. The cost of creating groundtruth using our methodology is minimal. If character, word or zone groundtruth is available for any real document, the registration algorithm can be used to generate the corresponding groundtruth for a rescanned version of the document.

Active User Interfaces For Building Decision-Theoretic Systems Knowledge elicitation/acquisition continues to be a bottleneck to constructing decisiontheoretic  systems. Methodologies and techniques for incremental elicitation/acquisition of  knowledge especially under uncertainty in support of users' current goals is desirable. This  paper presents PESKI, a probabilistic expert system development environment. PESKI provides  users with a highly interactive and integrated suite of intelligent knowledge engineering  tools for decision-theoretic systems. From knowledge acquisition, data mining, and verification  and validation to a distributed inference engine for querying knowledge, PESKI is based  on the concept of active user interfaces -- actuators to the human-machine interface. PESKI  uses a number of techniques to reduce the inherent complexity of developing a cohesive, realworld  knowledge-based system. This is accomplished by providing multiple communication  modes for human-computer interaction and the use of a knowledge representation endowed  with the ability to detect problems with the knowledge acquired and alert the user to these  possible problems. We discuss PESKI's use of these intelligent assistants to help users with  the acquisition of knowledge especially in the presence of uncertainty.

Toward Scalability in ASL Recognition: Breaking Down Signs into Phonemes In this paper we present a novel approach to continuous, whole-sentence ASL recognition that uses phonemes instead of whole signs as the basic units. Our approach is based on a sequential phonological model of ASL. According to this model the ASL signs can be broken into movements and holds, which are both considered phonemes.  This model does away with the distinction between whole signs and epenthesis movements that we made in previous work [13]. Instead, epenthesis movements are just like the other movements that constitute the signs.  We subsequently train Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to recognize the phonemes, instead of whole signs and epenthesis movements that we recognized previously [13]. Because the number of phonemes is limited, HMM-based training and recognition of the ASL signal becomes computationally more tractable and has the potential to lead to the recognition of large-scale vocabularies.  We experimented with a 22 word vocabulary, and we achieved similar recognition r...

G-Algorithm for Extraction of Robust Decision Rules-Children's Postoperative Intra-Atrial Arrhythmia Case Study Clinical medicine is facing a challenge of knowledge discovery from the growing volume of data. In this paper, a data mining algorithm (G-algorithm) is proposed for extraction of robust rules that can be used in clinical practice for better understanding and prevention of unwanted medical events. The G-algorithm is applied to the data set obtained for children born with a malformation of the heart (univentricular heart). As the result of the Fontan surgical procedure, designed to palliate the children, 10%--35% of patients postoperatively develop an arrhythmia known as the intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia. There is an obvious need to identify the children that may develop the tachycardia before the surgery is performed. Prior attempts to identify such children with statistical techniques have been unrewarding. The G-algorithm discussed in this paper shows that there exists an unambiguous relationship between measurable features and the tachycardia. The data set used in this study shows that, for 78.08% of infants, the occurrence of tachycardia can be accurately predicted. The authors' prior computational experience with diverse medical data sets indicates that the percentage of accurate predictions may become even higher if data on additional features is collected for a larger data set.

Text Classification from Labeled and Unlabeled Documents using EM  This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large pool of unlabeled documents. This is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available.  We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. However these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class. Experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 30%.

On Representation and Approximation of Operations in Boolean Algebras Several universal approximation and universal representation results  are known for non-Boolean multi-valued logics such as fuzzy logics. In  this paper, we show that similar results can be proven for multi-valued  Boolean logics as well.  Introduction. The study of Boolean algebras started when G. Boole [1] considered the simplest Boolean algebra -- the two-valued algebra B (2) = f0; 1g (=ffalse,trueg). In this algebra, the operation  ([),  ("), and negation a  0 (:a) have the direct logical meaning of "or", "and", and "not". It is known that in this Boolean algebra, an arbitrary operation, i.e., an arbitrary function B \Theta : : : \Theta B ! B, can be represented as a superposition of these three basic logical operations: e.g., the implication a ! b can be represented as b :a, etc. Logic is still one of the area of application of Boolean algebras, but, starting from the classical Kolmogorov's monograph [4], Boolean algebras -- namely, algebras of events -- became an important tool i...

Mobile Agent Organizations Mobile agents are a useful paradigm -- other than a useful technology -- for the development of complex Internet applications. However, the effective development of mobile agent applications requires suitable models and infrastructures. This paper proposes an organizational approach to the high-level design of mobile agent applications. The idea is to models the Internet as a multiplicity of local and active organizational contexts, intended as the places where coordination activities of application agents occur and are ruled. The paper discusses the advantages and the generality of such an approach, also with the help of a case study in the area of tourist assistance.

AI in Medicine on its way from knowledge-intensive to data-intensive systems The last 20 years of research and development in the field of artificial intelligence in medicine show a path from knowledge-intensive systems, which try to capture the essential knowledge of experts in a knowledge-based system, to data-intensive systems available today. Nowadays enormous amounts of information is accessible electronically. Large data sets are collected continuously monitoring physiological parameters of patients. Knowledgebased  systems are needed to make use of all these data available and to help us to cope with the information explosion. In addition, temporal data analysis and intelligent information visualization can help us to get a summarized view of the change over time of clinical parameters. Integrating AIM modules into the daily-routine software environment of our care providers gives us a great chance for maintaining and improving quality of care.  1 AIM: a partial view of its scope and potential  This paper gives a personalized view of research and develop...

Intelligent Anticipated Exploration of Web Sites In this paper we describe a web search agent, called Global Search Agent (hereafter  GSA for short). GSA integrates and enhances several search techniques in order to  achieve significant improvements in the user-perceived quality of delivered information as  compared to usual web search engines. GSA features intelligent merging of relevant documents  from different search engines, anticipated selective exploration and evaluation of  links from the current resuk set, automated derivation of refined queries based on user relevance  feedback. System architecture as well as experimental accounts are also illustrated.

Web Page Classification Using Spatial Information Extracting and processing information from web pages is an important  task in many areas like constructing search engines, information retrieval, and data  mining from the Web. Common approach in the extraction process is to represent a  page as a "bag of words" and then to perform additional processing on such a flat  representation. In this paper we propose a new, hierarchical representation that  includes browser screen coordinates for every HTML object in a page. Such spatial  information allows the definition of heuristics for recognition of common page  areas such as header, left and right menu, footer and center of a page. We show a  preliminary experiment where our heuristics are able to correctly recognize objects  in 73% of cases. Finally, we show that a Naive Bayes classifier, taking into account  the proposed representation, clearly outperforms the same classifier using only  information about the content of documents.

PVM: Parallel View Maintenance Under Concurrent Data Updates of Distributed Sources Data warehouses (DW) are built by gathering information from distributed information  sources (ISs) and integrating it into one customized repository. In recent years, work has begun  to address the problem of view maintenance of DWs under concurrent data updates of  different ISs. Popular solutions such as ECA and Strobe achieve such concurrent maintenance  however with the requirement of quiescence of the ISs. More recently, the SWEEP solution  releases this quiescence requirement using a local compensation strategy that now processes all  update messages in a sequential manner. To optimize upon this sequential processing, we have  developed a parallel view maintenance algorithm, called PVM, that incorporates all benefits of  previous maintenance approaches while offering improved performance due to parallelism. In  order to perform parallel view maintenance, we have identified two critical issues: (1) detecting  maintenance-concurrent data updates in a parallel mode, and (2) correcting the problem that  the DW commit order may not correspond to the DW update processing order due to parallel  maintenance handling. In this work, we provide solutions to both issues. Given a modular  component-based system architecture, we insert a middle-layer timestamp assignment module  for detecting maintenance-concurrent data updates without requiring any global clock synchronization.  In addition, we introduce the negative counter concept as a simple yet elegant solution  to solve the problem of variant orders of committing effects of data updates to the DW. We  have proven the correctness of PVM to guarantee that our strategy indeed generates the correct  final DW state. We have implemented both SWEEP and PVM in our EVE data warehousing  system.

Performance and Memory-Access Characterization of Data Mining Applications This paper characterizes the performance and memoryaccess behavior of a decision tree induction program, a previously unstudied application used in data mining and knowledge discovery in databases. Performance is studied via RSIM, an execution driven simulator, for three uniprocessor models that exploit Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) to varying degrees. Several properties of the program are noted. Outof -order dispatch and multiple-issue provide a significant performance advantage: 50%--250% improvement in IPC for out-of-order versus in-order, and 5%--120% improvement in IPC for four-way issue versus singleissue. Multiple-issue provides a greater performance improvement for larger L2 cache sizes, when the program is limited by CPU performance; out-of-order dispatch provides a greater performance improvement for smaller L2 cache sizes. The program has a very small instruction footprint: an 8-kB L1 instruction cache is sufficient to bring the instruction miss rate below 0.1%. A smal...

Testing Access To External Information Sources in a Mediator Environment This paper discusses the testing of communication in the increasingly important class of distributed information systems that are based on a mediator architecture. A mediator integrates existing information sources into a new application. In order to answer complex queries, the mediator splits them up into subqueries which it sends to the information sources, and it combines the replies to answer the original query. Since the information sources are usually remote, autonomous systems, the access to them can be erroneous, most notably when the information source is subject to modifications. Such errors may result in incorrect behaviour of the whole system. This paper addresses the problem of deciding whether an information source as part of a mediatory system was successfully queried or not. The primary contribution is a formal framework for the general information access testing problem. Besides proposing several solutions, it is investigated what the most important quality measures of such testing methods are. Moreover, the practical usability of the presented approaches is demonstrated on a real-world application using Web-based information sources. Several empirical experiments are conductedto compare the presented methods with previous work in the field.

The Complexity of Revising Logic Programs A rule-based program will return a set of answers to each query. An impure program, which includes the Prolog cut "!" and "not(\Delta)" operators, can return different answers if its rules are re-ordered. There are also many reasoning systems that return only the first answer found for each query; these first answers, too, depend on the rule order, even in pure rule-based systems. A theory revision algorithm, seeking a revised rule-base whose expected accuracy, over the distribution of queries, is optimal, should therefore consider modifying the order of the rules. This paper first shows that a polynomial number of training "labeled queries" (each a query paired with its correct answer) provides the distribution information necessary to identify the optimal ordering. It then proves, however, that the task of determining which ordering is optimal, once given this distributional information, is intractable even in trivial situations; e.g.,  even if each query is an atomic literal, we are...

From Regularization Operators to Support Vector Kernels We derive the correspondence between regularization operators used in Regularization Networks and Hilbert Schmidt Kernels appearing in Support Vector Machines. More specifically, we prove that the Green's Functions associated with regularization operators are suitable Support Vector Kernels with equivalent regularization properties. As a by--product we show that a large number of Radial Basis Functions namely conditionally positive definite functions may be used as Support Vector kernels. 1 INTRODUCTION  Support Vector (SV) Machines for pattern recognition, regression estimation and operator inversion exploit the idea of transforming into a high dimensional feature space where they perform a linear algorithm. Instead of evaluating this map explicitly, one uses Hilbert Schmidt Kernels k(x; y) which correspond to dot products of the mapped data in high dimensional space, i.e.  k(x; y) = (\Phi(x) \Delta \Phi(y)) (1) with \Phi : R  n  !

Mining High-Speed Data Streams Many organizations today have more than very large databases; they have databases that grow without limit at a rate of several million records per day. Mining these continuous data streams brings unique opportunities, but also new challenges. This paper describes and evaluates VFDT, an anytime system that builds decision trees using constant memory and constant time per example. VFDT can incorporate tens of thousands of examples per second using o#-the-shelf hardware. It uses Hoe#ding bounds to guarantee that its output is asymptotically nearly identical to that of a conventional learner. We study VFDT's properties and demonstrate its utility through an extensive set of experiments on synthetic data. We apply VFDT to mining the continuous stream of Web access data from the whole University of Washington main campus.

A Hybrid Architecture for Situated Learning of Reactive Sequential Decision Making In developing autonomous agents, one usually emphasizes only (situated) procedural knowledge, ignoring more explicit declarative knowledge. On the other hand, in developing symbolic reasoning models, one usually emphasizes only declarative knowledge, ignoring procedural knowledge. In contrast, we have developed a learning model Clarion, which is a hybrid connectionist model consisting of both localist and distributed representations, based on the two-level approach proposed in Sun (1995).  Clarion learns and utilizes both procedural and declarative knowledge, tapping into the synergy of the two types of processes, and enables an agent to learn in situated contexts and generalize resulting knowledge to different scenarios. It unifies connectionist, reinforcement, and symbolic learning in a synergistic way, to perform on-line, bottom-up learning. This summary paper presents one version of the architecture and some results of the experiments. Key Words: hybrid models, sequential decision ...

GTM: The Generative Topographic Mapping Latent variable models represent the probability density of data in a space of several dimensions in terms of a smaller number of latent, or hidden, variables. A familiar example is factor analysis which is based on a linear transformations between the latent space and the data space. In this paper we introduce a form of non-linear latent variable model called the Generative Topographic Mapping for which the parameters of the model can be determined using the EM algorithm. GTM provides a principled alternative to the widely used Self-Organizing Map (SOM) of Kohonen (1982), and overcomes most of the significant limitations of the SOM. We demonstrate the performance of the GTM algorithm on a toy problem and on simulated data from flow diagnostics for a multi-phase oil pipeline.

Learning Visual Landmarks for Pose Estimation We present an approach to vision-based mobile robot localization, even without an a-priori pose estimate. This is accomplished by learning a set of visual features called image-domain landmarks. The landmark learning mechanism is designed to be applicable to a wide range of environments. Each landmark is detected as a local extremum of a measure of uniqueness and represented by an appearance-based encoding. Localization is performed using a method that matches observed landmarks to learned prototypes and generates independent position estimates for each match. The independent estimates are then combined to obtain a final position estimate, with an associated uncertainty. Quantitative experimental evidence is presented that demonstrates that accurate pose estimates can be obtained, despite changes to the environment.

Concept Indexing - A Fast Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm with Applications to Document Retrieval & Categorization In recent years, we have seen a tremendous growth in the volume of text documents available on the Internet, digital libraries, news sources, and company-wide intranets. This has led to an increased interest in developing meth-ods that can efficiently categorize and retrieve relevant information. Retrieval techniques based on dimensionality reduction, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), have been shown to improve the quality of the information being retrieved by capturing the latent meaning of the words present in the documents. Unfortunately, the high computa-tional requirements of LSI and its inability to compute an effective dimensionality reduction in a supervised setting limits its applicability. In this paper we present a fast dimensionality reduction algorithm, called concept indexing (CI) that is equally effective for unsupervised and supervised dimensionality reduction. CI computes a k-dimensional representation of a collection of documents by first clustering the documents into k groups, and then using the cen-troid vectors of the clusters to derive the axes of the reduced k-dimensional space. Experimental results show that the dimensionality reduction computed by CI achieves comparable retrieval performance to that obtained using LSI, while requiring an order of magnitude less time. Moreover, when CI is used to compute the dimensionality reduction in a supervised setting, it greatly improves the performance of traditional classification algorithms such as C4.5 and kNN. 1

A Possible World Semantics for Disjunctive Databases We investigate the fundamental problem of when a ground atom in a disjunctive database is assumed false. There are basically two different approaches for inferring negative information for disjunctive databases; they are Minker's Generalized Closed World Assumption (GCWA) and Ross and Topor's Disjunctive Database Rule (DDR). A problem with the GCWA is that disjunctive clauses are sometimes interpreted exclusively, even when they are intended for inclusive interpretation. On the other hand, the DDR always interprets disjunctive clauses inclusively. We argue that neither approach is satisfactory. Whether a disjunctive clause is interpreted exclusively or inclusively should be specified explicitly. Negative information should then be inferred according to the stated intent of the disjunctive clauses. A database semantics called PWS is proposed to solve the aforementioned problem. We also show that for propositional databases with no negative clauses, the problem of determining...

Query Processing for Moving Objects with Space-Time Grid Storage Model With growing popularity of mobile computing devices and wireless communications, managing dynamically changing information about moving objects is becoming feasible. In this paper, we implement a system that manages such information and propose two new algorithms. One is an efficient range query algorithm with a ltering step which efficiently determines if a polyline corresponding to the trajectory of a moving object intersects with a given range. The other is a nearest neighbor query algorithm. We study the performance of the system, which shows that despite the filtering step, for moderately large ranges, the range query algorithm we propose outperforms the algorithm without filtering.

Automated Discovery of Concise Predictive Rules for Intrusion Detection This paper details an essential component of a multi-agent distributed knowledge network system  for intrusion detection. We describe a distributed intrusion detection architecture, complete with a  data warehouse and mobile and stationary agents for distributed problem-solving to facilitate building,  monitoring, and analyzing global, spatio-temporal views of intrusions on large distributed systems. An  agent for the intrusion detection system, which uses a machine learning approach to automated discovery  of concise rules from system call traces, is described.  We use a feature vector representation to describe the system calls executed by privileged processes.  The feature vectors are labeled as good or bad depending on whether or not they were executed during  an observed attack. A rule learning algorithm is then used to induce rules that can be used to monitor  the system and detect potential intrusions. We study the performance of the rule learning algorithm on  this task with an...

Reinforcement Learning for a Vision Based Mobile Robot Reinforcement learning systems improve behaviour based on scalar rewards from a critic. In this work vision based behaviours, servoing and wandering, are learned through a Q-learning method which handles continuous states and actions. There is no requirement for camera calibration, an actuator model, or a knowledgeable teacher. Learning through observing the actions of other behaviours improves learning speed. Experiments were performed on a mobile robot using a real-time vision system. 1 Introduction Collision free wandering and visual servoing are building blocks for purposeful robot behaviours such as foraging, target pursuit and landmark based navigation. Visual servoing consists of moving some part of a robot to a desired position using visual feedback [15]. Wandering is an environment exploration behaviour [6]. In this work we demonstrate real-time learning of wandering and servoing on a real robot. Learning eliminates the calibration process and leads to flexible behaviour....

Using Explicit Requirements and Metrics for Interface Agent User Model Correction The complexity of current computer systems and software warrants  research into methods to decrease the cognitive load on users.  Determining how to get the right information into the right form with  the right tool at the right time has become a monumental task --- one  necessitating intelligent interfaces agents with the ability to predict  the users' needs or intent.  An accurate user model is considered necessary for effective prediction  of user intent. Methods for maintaining accurate user models  is the main thrust of this paper. We describe an approach for dynamically  correcting an interface agent's user model based on utility-theory.  We explicitly take into account an agent's requirements and metrics  for measuring the agent's effectiveness of meeting those requirements.  Using these requirements and metrics, we develop a requirements utility  function that determines when a user model should be corrected  and how.

Evaluating Database Selection Techniques: A Testbed and Experiment We describe a testbed for database selection techniques and an experiment conducted using this testbed. The testbed is a decomposition of the TREC/TIPSTER data that allows analysis of the data along multiple dimensions, including collection-based and temporal-based analysis.

Integrated Document Caching and Prefetching in Storage Hierarchies Based on Markov-Chain Predictions .<F3.733e+05> Large multimedia document archives may hold a major fraction of their data in tertiary storage libraries for cost reasons. This paper develops an integrated approach to the vertical data migration between the tertiary, secondary, and primary storage in that it reconciles speculative prefetching, to mask the high latency of the tertiary storage, with the replacement policy of the document caches at the secondary and primary storage level, and also considers the interaction of these policies with the tertiary and secondary storage request scheduling. The integrated migration policy is based on a continuoustime Markov chain model for predicting the expected number of accesses to a document within a specified time horizon. Prefetching is initiated only if that expectation is higher than those of the documents that need to be dropped from secondary storage to free up the necessary space. In addition, the possible resource contention at the tertiary and secondary storage is tak...

Antisocial Bidding in Repeated Vickrey Auctions In recent years auctions have become more and more important in the eld  of multiagent systems as useful mechanisms for resource allocation and task  assignment. In many cases the Vickrey (second-price sealed-bid) auction is  used as a protocol that prescribes how the individual agents have to interact  in order to come to an agreement. The main reasons for choosing the Vickrey  auction are the low bandwidth and time consumption due to just one round  of bidding and the existence of a dominant bidding strategy under certain  conditions. We show that the Vickrey auction, despite its theoretical benets,  is inappropriate if \antisocial" agents participate in the auction process.

Under this novel condition, agents need to deviate from the  dominant truth-telling strategy. This report presents a strategy for bidders...

A Computational Model of Word Learning from Multimodal Sensory Input How do infants segment continuous streams of speech to discover words of their language? Current theories emphasize the role of acoustic evidence in discovering word boundaries (Cutler 1991; Brent 1999; de Marcken 1996; Friederici & Wessels 1993; see also Bolinger & Gertsman 1957). To test an alternate hypothesis, we recorded natural infant-directed speech from caregivers engaged in play with their pre-linguistic infants centered around common objects. We also recorded the visual context in which the speech occurred by capturing images of these objects. We analyzed the data using two computational models, one of which processed only acoustic recordings, and a second model which integrated acoustic and visual input. The models were implemented using standard speech and vision processing techniques enabling the models to process sensory data. We show that using visual context in conjunction with spoken input dramatically improves learning when compared with using acoustic evidence alone....

Focused Web Crawling: A Generic Framework for Specifying the User Interest and for Adaptive Crawling Strategies Compared to the standard web search engines, focused  crawlers yield good recall as well as good  precision by restricting themselves to a limited domain.  In this paper, we do not introduce another focused  crawler, but we introduce a generic  framework for focused crawling consisting of two  major components: (1) Specification of the user interest  and measuring the resulting relevance of a  given web page. The proposed method of specifying  the user interest by a formula combining atomic  topics significantly improves the expressive  power of the user. (2) Crawling strategy. Ordering  the links at the crawl frontier is a challenging task  since pages of a low relevance may be on a path to  highly relevant pages. Thus, tunneling may be necessary.  The explicit specification of the user interest  allows us to define topic-specific strategies for  tunneling. Our system Ariadne is a prototype implementation  of the proposed framework. An experimental  evaluation of different crawling  strategies demonstrates the performance gain obtained  by focusing a crawl and by dynamically  adapting the focus.  1

Case-Based and Symbolic Classification Algorithms . Contrary to symbolic learning approaches, that represent a learned concept explicitly, case-based approaches describe concepts implicitly  by a pair (CB;sim), i.e. by a measure of similarity sim and a set CB of cases. This poses the question if there are any differences concerning the learning power of the two approaches. In this article we will study the relationship between the case base, the measure of similarity, and the target concept of the learning process. To do so, we transform a simple symbolic learning algorithm (the version space algorithm) into an equivalent case-based variant. The achieved results strengthen the hypothesis of the equivalence of the learning power of symbolic and casebased methods and show the interdependency between the measure used by a case-based algorithm and the target concept. 1 Introduction  In this article we want to compare the learning power of two important learning paradigms -- the symbolic and the case-based approach [1, 4].

We propose a series of formal distinctions among   these terms and several others. We argue that all of these are specializations  of the more foundational category of correlation,   which can be measured by the joint information of a system. We   also propose congruence as a category orthogonal to the others,  reflecting the degree to which correlation and its specializations   satisfy user requirements. Then we explore the degree to which   lack of correlation can arise purposefully, and show the need to   use formal stochasticity in cases where such lack of correlation is   truly necessary (such as in stochastic search).

Automatic Landmark Selection for Navigation with Panoramic Vision The use of visual landmarks for robot navigation is a promising field. It is apparent that the success of navigating by visual landmarks depends on the landmarks chosen. This paper reviews a monocular camera system proposed by [ Bianco and Zelinsky, 1999 ] which automatically selects landmarks and uses them for localisation and navigation tasks. The monocular system's landmark selection policy results in a limited area in which the robot can successfully localise itself. A new landmark navigation system which uses a panoramic vision system to overcome this restriction is proposed and the first steps taken in the development of the new system are reported. 1 Introduction  Visual navigation is one of the key problems in making successful autonomous robots. Vision as a sensor is the richest source of information about a mobile agents enviroment and as such contains information vital to solving navigation problems. One limit to visual navigation is the narrow field of view offered by norma...

Incremental Learning of Control Knowledge For Nonlinear Problem Solving In this paper we advocate a learning method where a deductive  and an inductive strategies are combined to efficiently learn control  knowledge. The approach consists of initially bounding the explanation  to a predetermined set of problem solving features. Since there is no  proof that the set is sufficient to capture the correct and complete explanation  for the decisions, the control rules acquired are then refined,  if and when applied incorrectly to new examples. The method is especially  significant as it applies directly to nonlinear problem solving, where  the search space is complete. We present hamlet, a system where we  implemented this learning method, within the context of the prodigy  architecture. hamlet learns control rules for individual decisions corresponding  to new learning opportunities offered by the nonlinear problem  solver that go beyond the linear one. These opportunities involve, among  other issues, completeness, quality of plans, and opportunistic decision  making. Finally, we show empirical results illustrating hamlet's learning  performance.

Model Generation for Natural-Language Semantic Analysis . Semantic analysis refers to the analysis of semantic representations by inference on the basis of semantic information and world knowledge. I present some potential applications of model generators and model generation theorem provers in the construction and analysis of natural-language semantics where both the process of model generation and the computed models are valuable sources of information. I discuss Bry and Torge's hyper-resolution tableaux calculus EP as an approach to model generation for natural-language semantic analysis. 1 Introduction  One goal of modern natural-language semantics has been to capture the conditions under which a sentence can be uttered truthfully. In logic-based semantic formalisms such as Discourse Representation Theory [17] or Montague Grammar [22], the representations constructed for natural-language sentences are logical formulas whose truth-conditions are described by their models. The construction of semantic representations requires, amongst oth...

Server Selection on the World Wide Web We evaluate server selection methods in a Web environment, modeling a digital library which makes use of existing Web search servers rather than building its own index. The evaluation framework portrays the Web realistically in several ways. Its search servers index real Web documents, are of various sizes, cover different topic areas and employ different retrieval methods. Selection is based on statistics extracted from the results of probe queries submitted to each server. We evaluate published selection methods and a new method for enhancing selection based on expected search server effectiveness. Results show CORI to be the most effective of three published selection methods. CORI selection steadily degrades with fewer probe queries, causing a drop in early precision of as much as 0#05 (one relevant document out of 20). Modifying CORI selection based on an estimation of expected effectiveness disappointingly yields no significant improvement in effectiveness. However, modifying COR...

Single Display Groupware: A Model for Co-present Collaboration We introduce a model for supporting collaborative work between people that are physically close to each other. We call this model Single Display Groupware (SDG). In this paper, we describe this model, comparing it to more traditional remote collaboration.

Tracking in Unprepared Environments for Augmented Reality Systems Many Augmented Reality applications require accurate tracking. Existing tracking techniques require prepared environments to ensure accurate results. This paper motivates the need to pursue Augmented Reality tracking techniques that work in unprepared environments, where users are not allowed to modify the real environment, such as in outdoor applications. Accurate tracking in such situations is difficult, requiring hybrid approaches. This paper summarizes two 3DOF results: a real-time system with a compass -- inertial hybrid, and a non-real-time system fusing optical and inertial inputs. We then describe the preliminary results of 5- and 6-DOF tracking methods run in simulation. Future work and limitations are described.

A Software Model and Specification Language for Non-WIMP User Interfaces We present a software model and language for describing and programming the fine-grained aspects of interaction in a non-WIMP user interface, such as a virtual environment. Our approach is based on our view that the essence of a non-WIMP dialogue is a set of continuous relationships---most of which are temporary. The model combines a data-flow or constraint-like component for the continuous relationships with an event-based component for discrete interactions, which can enable or disable individual continuous relationships. To demonstrate our approach, we present the PMIW user interface management system for non-WIMP interactions, a set of examples running under it, a visual editor for our user interface description language, and a discussion of our implementation and our restricted use of constraints for a performance-driven interactive situation. Our goal is to provide a model and language that captures the formal structure of non-WIMP interactions in the way that various previous te...

Proverb: The Probabilistic Cruciverbalist We attacked the problem of solving crossword puzzles by computer: given a set of clues and a crossword grid, try to maximize the number of words correctly filled in. After an analysis of a large collection of puzzles, we decided to use an open architecture in which independent programs specialize in solving specific types of clues, drawing on ideas from information retrieval, database search, and machine learning. Each expert module generates a (possibly empty) candidate list for each clue, and the lists are merged together and placed into the grid by a centralized solver. We used a probabilistic representation throughout the system as a common interchange language between subsystems and to drive the search for an optimal solution.  Proverb, the complete system, averages 95.3% words correct and 98.1% letters correct in under 15 minutes per puzzle on a sample of 370 puzzles taken from the New York Times and several other puzzle sources. This corresponds to missing roughly 3 words or 4 l...

Alternative Representations and Abstractions for Moving Sensors Databases Moving sensors refers to an emerging class of data intensive applications that impacts disciplines such as communication, health-care, scientific applications, etc. These applications consist of a fixed number of sensors that move and produce streams of data as a function of time. They may require the system to match these streams against stored streams to retrieve relevant data (patterns). With communication, for example, a speaking impaired individual might utilize a haptic glove that translates hand signs into written (spoken) words. The glove consists of sensors for dierent nger joints. These sensors report their location and values as a function of time, producing streams of data. These streams are matched against a repository of spatio-temporal streams to retrieve the corresponding English character or word.  The contributions of this study are two folds. First, it introduces a framework to store and retrieve "moving sensors" data. The framework advocates physical data independence and software-reuse. Second, we investigate alternative representations for storage and retrieval of data in support of query processing. We quantify the tradeoff associated with these alternatives using empirical data from RoboCup soccer matches.

A Case-Based Reasoning Approach to Learning Control The paper describes an application of a case-based reasoning system TA3, to a control task in robotics. It differs from previous methods in its approach to relevancy-based retrieval, which allows for greater flexibility and for improved accuracy in performance. Most successful robotic manipulators are precise, fast, smooth and have high repeatability. Their major drawback is their tendency to have only a limited repertoire of movements that can only be extended by costly inverse kinematic calculations or direct teaching. Our approach also starts with a limited repertoire of movements, but can incrementally add new positions and thus allows for higher flexibility. The proposed architecture is experimentally evaluated on two real world domains, albeit simple, and the results are compared to other machine learning algorithms applied to the same problem.

Personalized Information Management for Web Intelligence Web intelligence can be defined as the process of scanning and tracking information on the World Wide Web so as to gain competitive advantages. This paper describes a system known as Flexible Organizer for Competitive Intelligence (FOCI) that transforms raw URLs returned by internet search engines into personalized information portfolios. FOCI builds information portfolios by gathering and organizing on-line information according to a user's needs and preferences. Through a novel method called User-Configurable Clustering, a user can personalize his/her portfolios in terms of the content as well as the information structure. The personalized portfolios can then be used to track new information and organize them into appropriate folders accordingly. We show a sample session of FOCI which illustrates how a user may create and personalize an information portfolio according to his/her preferences and how the system discovers novel information groupings while organizing familiar information according to the userdefined themes.

Statistical Phrases in Automated Text Categorization In this work we investigate the usefulness of n-grams for document indexing in text categorization  (TC). We call n-gram a set t k of n word stems, and we say that t k occurs in a document  d j when a sequence of words appears in d j that, after stop word removal and stemming,  consists exactly of the n stems in t k , in some order. Previous researches have investigated the  use of n-grams (or some variant of them) in the context of specific learning algorithms, and  thus have not obtained general answers on their usefulness for TC. In this work we investigate  the usefulness of n-grams in TC independently of any specific learning algorithm. We do so  by applying feature selection to the pool of all #-grams (#  #  n), and checking how many  n-grams score high enough to be selected in the top # #-grams. We report the results of  our experiments, using several feature selection functions and varying values of #, performed  on the Reuters-21578 standard TC benchmark. We also report results of making actual use  of the selected n-grams in the context of a linear classifier induced by means of the Rocchio  method.

An Analytical Study of Object Identifier Indexing The object identifier index of an object-oriented database system is typically 20% of the size of the database itself, and for large databases, only a small part of the index fits in main memory. To avoid index retrievals becoming a bottleneck, efficient buffering strategies are needed to minimize the number of disk accesses. In this report, we develop analytical cost models which we use to find optimal sizes of index page buffer and index entry cache, for different memory sizes, index sizes, and access patterns. Because existing buffer hit estimation models are not applicable for index page buffering in the case of tree based indexes, we have also developed an analytical model for index page buffer performance. The cost gain from using the results in this report is typically in the order of 200-300%. Thus, the results should be of valuable use in optimizers and tools for configuration and tuning of object-oriented database systems. 1 Introduction  In a large OODB with logical object i...

Reasoning With Inconsistency in Structured Text Reasoning with inconsistency involves some compromise on classical logic. There is a range  of proposals for logics (called paraconsistent logics) for reasoning with inconsistency each with  pros and cons. Selecting an appropriate paraconsistent logic for an application depends on  the requirements of the application. Here we review paraconsistent logics for the potentially  significant application area of technology for structured text. Structured text is a general  concept that is implicit in a variety of approaches to handling information. Syntactically, an  item of structured text is a number of grammatically simple phrases together with a semantic  label for each phrase. Items of structured text may be nested within larger items of structured  text. The semantic labels in a structured text are meant to parameterize a stereotypical  situation, and so a particular item of structured text is an instance of that stereotypical  situation.

Parsing As Information Compression By Multiple Alignment, Unification And Search: SP52 This article presents and discusses examples illustrating aspects of the proposition, described in the accompanying article (Wolff, 1998), that parsing may be understood as information compression by multiple alignment, unification and search (ICMAUS). The later examples show that the multiple alignment framework as described in the accompanying article has expressive power which is comparable with other `context sensitive' systems used to represent the syntax of natural languages. In all the examples, the SP52 model, described in the accompanying article, is capable of finding an alignment which is intuitively `correct' and assigning to it a `compression score' which is higher than for any other alignment. The congruance which has been found between this range of alignments produced by a system which is dedicated to information compression and what is judged to be `correct' in terms of linguistic intuition lends support to the hypothesis that linguistic intuition is itself a product o...

Document Classification with Unsupervised Artificial Neural Networks Text collections may be regarded as an almost perfect application arena for unsupervised neural networks. This is because many operations computers have to perform on text documents are classification tasks based on noisy patterns. In particular we rely on self-organizing maps which produce a map of the document space after their training process. From geography, however, it is known that maps are not always the best way to represent information spaces. For most applications it is better to provide a hierarchical view of the underlying data collection in form of an atlas where, starting from a map representing the complete data collection, different regions are shown at finer levels of granularity. Using an atlas, the user can easily "zoom" into regions of particular interest while still having general maps for overall orientation. We show that a similar display can be obtained by using hierarchical feature maps to represent the contents of a document archive. These neural networks have layerd architecture where each layer consists of a number of individual self-organizing maps. By this, the contents of the text archive may be represented at arbitrary detail while still having the general maps available for global orientation.

Boosting and Rocchio Applied to Text Filtering We discuss two learning algorithms for text filtering: modified Rocchio and a boosting algorithm called AdaBoost. We show how both algorithms can be adapted to maximize any general utility matrix that associates cost (or gain) for each pair of machine prediction and correct label. We first show that AdaBoost significantly outperforms another highly effective text filtering algorithm. We then compare AdaBoost and Rocchio over three large text filtering tasks. Overall both algorithms are comparable and are quite effective. AdaBoost produces better classifiers than Rocchio when the training collection contains a very large number of relevant documents. However, on these tasks, Rocchio runs much faster than AdaBoost. 1 Introduction  With the explosion in the amount of information available electronically, information filtering systems that automatically send articles of potential interest to a user are becoming increasingly important.

An Fft-Based Algorithm For Multichannel Blind Deconvolution A new update equation for the general multichannel blind deconvolution (MCBD) of a convolved mixture of source signals is derived. It is based on the update equation for blind source separation (BSS), which has been shown to be an alternative interpretation [1] of the natural gradient applied to the minimization of some mutual information criterion [2]. Computational complexity is held at a minimum by carrying out the separation/equalization task in the frequency domain. The algorithm is compared to similar known blind algorithms and its validity is demonstrated by simulations of real-world acoustic filters. In order to assess the performance of the algorithm, performance measures for multichannel blind deconvolution of signals are given in the paper. 1.

Algorithm-Directed Exploration for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning in Factored MDPs One of the central challenges in reinforcement  learning is to balance the exploration/exploitation  tradeoff while scaling up to large problems. Although  model-based reinforcement learning has  been less prominent than value-based methods in  addressing these challenges, recent progress has  generated renewed interest in pursuing modelbased  approaches: Theoretical work on the exploration  /exploitation tradeoff has yielded provably  sound model-based algorithms such as E    Rmax , while work on factored MDP representations  has yielded model-based algorithms that can  scale up to large problems. Recently the benefits  of both achievements have been combined in the    algorithm of Kearns and Koller. In  this paper, we address a significant shortcoming  of Factored E    : namely that it requires an oracle  planner that cannot be feasibly implemented. We  propose an alternative approach that uses a practical  approximate planner, approximate linear programming,  that maintains desirable properties. Further,  we develop an exploration strategy that is targeted  toward improving the performance of the linear  programming algorithm, rather than an oracle  planner. This leads to a simple exploration strategy  that visits states relevant to tightening the LP solution,  and achieves sample efficiency logarithmic in  the size of the problem description. Our experimental  results show that the targeted approach performs  better than using approximate planning for implementing  either Factored E    or Factored Rmax .

Representing School Timetabling in a Disjunctive Logic Programming Language In this paper, we show how school timetabling problems with preferences originating from didactical, organisational and personal considerations can be represented in a highly declarative and natural way, using an extension of disjunctive datalog by strong and weak (integrity) constraints. 1 Introduction  Almost all people have come across school timetabling during their lives. For a long time almost all school timetables were created manually, a timeconsuming task, which often yielded suboptimal schedules. In the last thirty years, however, systems have been designed which automate timetable creation.  Timetabling in general is the problem of finding suitable combinations of two or more types of resources which have to be at the same place during several discrete periods of time and which have to satisfy various additional constraints. Some of these constraints are strict while some are not (the latter express preferences or desiderata). In the case of school timetabling problems these...

A Probabilistic Model for Dimensionality Reduction in Information Retrieval and Filtering Dimension reduction methods, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), when applied to semantic spaces built upon text collections, improve information retrieval, information filtering and word sense disambiguation. A new dual probability model based on similarity concepts is introduced to explain the observed success. Semantic associations can be quantitatively characterized by their statistical significance, the likelihood. Semantic dimensions containing redundant and noisy information can be separated out and should be ignored because their contribution to the overall statistical significance is negative, giving rise to LSI: LSI is the optimal solution of the model. The peak in likelihood curve indicates the existence of an intrinsic semantic dimension. The importance of LSI dimensions follows the Zipf-distribution, indicating that LSI dimensions represent latent concepts. Document frequency of words follow the Zipf distribution, and the number of distinct words follows log-normal distribution. Experiments on four standard document collections both confirm and illustrate the results and concepts presented here.

Indexing and Querying XML Data for Regular Path Expressions With the advent of XML as a standard for data  representation and exchange on the Internet,  storing and querying XML data becomes more  and more important. Several XML query languages  have been proposed, and the common  feature of the languages is the use of regular  path expressions to query XML data. This  poses a new challenge concerning indexing and  searching XML data, because conventional approaches  based on tree traversals may not meet  the processing requirements under heavy access  requests. In this paper, we propose a  new system for indexing and storing XML data  based on a numbering scheme for elements.  This numbering scheme quickly determines the  ancestor-descendant relationship between elements  in the hierarchy of XML data. We also  propose several algorithms for processing regular  path expressions, namely, (1) ##-Join for  searching paths from an element to another,  (2) ##-Join for scanning sorted elements and  attributes to find element-attribute pairs, and  (3) ##-Join for finding Kleene-Closure on repeated  paths or elements. The ##-Join algorithm  is highly effective particularly for searching  paths that are very long or whose lengths  are unknown. Experimental results from our  prototype system implementation show that the  proposed algorithms can process XML queries  with regular path expressions by up to an or-  #  This work was sponsored in part by National Science Foundation CAREER Award (IIS-9876037) and Research Infrastructure program EIA-0080123.

Visual Interpretation of Hand Gestures for Human-Computer Interaction: A Review The use of hand gestures provides an attractive alternative to cumbersome interface devices for human-computer interaction (HCI). In particular, visual interpretation of hand gestures can help in achieving the ease and naturalness desired for HCI. We survey the literature on vision-based hand gesture recognition within the context of its role in HCI. The number of approaches to video-based hand gesture recognition has grown in recent years. Thus, the need for systematization and analysis of different aspects of gestural interaction has developed. We discuss a complete model of hand gestures that possesses both spatial and dynamic properties of human hand gestures and can accommodate for all their natural types. Two classes of models that have been employed for interpretation of hand gestures for HCI are considered. The first utilizes 3D models of the human hand, while the second relies on the appearance of the human hand in the image. Investigation of model parameters and analysis feat...

RAW: A Relational Algebra for the Web The main idea underlying the paper is to extend the relational algebra such that it becomes possible to process queries against the World-Wide Web. These extensions are minor in that we tried to keep them at the domain level. Additionally to the known domains (int, bool, float, string), we introduce three new domains to deal with URLs, html-documents or fragments thereof, and path expressions. Over these domains we define several functions that are accessible from the algebra within the subscripts of the relational operators. The approach allows us to reuse the operators of the relational algebra without major modifications. Indead, the only extension necessary is the introduction of a map operator. Further, two modifications to the scan and the indexscan are necessary. Finally, the indexscan which has the functionality of a typical meta-search engine is capable of computing a unified rank based on the tuple order provided by the underlying search engines. 1 Introduction  The Web [2] w...

Dynamic Logic Programming In this paper we investigate updates of knowledge bases represented by logic programs. In order to represent negative information, we use generalized logic programs which allow default negation not only in rule bodies but also in their heads.We start by introducing the notion of an update $P\oplus U$ of a logic program $P$ by another logic program $U$. Subsequently, we provide a precise semantic characterization of $P\oplus U$, and study some basic properties of program updates. In particular, we show that our update programs generalize the notion of interpretation update. We then extend this notion to compositional sequences of logic programs updates $P_{1}\oplus P_{2}\oplus \dots $, defining a dynamic program update, and thereby introducing the paradigm of \emph{dynamic logic programming}. This paradigm significantly facilitates modularization of logic programming, and thus modularization of non-monotonic reasoning as a whole. Specifically, suppose that we are given a set of logic program modules, each describing a different state of our knowledge of the world. Different states may represent different time points or different sets of priorities or perhaps even different viewpoints. Consequently, program modules may contain mutually contradictory as well as overlapping information. The role of the dynamic program update is to employ the mutual relationships existing between different modules to precisely determine, at any given module composition stage, the declarative as well as the procedural semantics of the combined program resulting from the modules.

Extraction of Semantic XML DTDs from Texts Using Data Mining Techniques Although composed of unstructured texts, documents contained in textual archives such as public announcements, patient records and annual reports to shareholders often share an inherent though undocumented structure. In order to facilitate efficient, structure-based search in archives and to enable information integration of text collections with related data sources, this inherent structure should be made explicit as detailed as possible. Inferring a semantic and structured XML document type definition (DTD) for an archive and subsequently transforming the corresponding texts into XML documents is a successful method to achieve this objective. The main contribution of this paper is a new method to derive structured XML DTDs in order to extend previously derived flat DTDs. We use the DIAsDEM framework to derive a preliminary, unstructured XML DTD whose components are supported by a large number of documents. However, all XML tags contained in this preliminary DTD cannot a priori be assumed to be mandatory. Additionally, there is no fixed order of XML tags and automatically tagging an archive using a derived DTD always implicates tagging errors. Hence, we introduce the notion of probabilistic XML DTDs whose components are assigned probabilities of being semantically and structurally correct. Our method for establishing a probabilistic XML DTD is based on discovering associations between, resp. frequent sequences of XML tags.

Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine Function approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest--descent minimization. A general gradient--descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least--squares, least--absolute--deviation, and Huber--M loss functions for regression, and multi--class logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are decision trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of decision trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire 1996, and Friedman, Has...

DyDa: Dynamic Data Warehouse Maintenance in a Fully Concurrent Environment Data warehouse is an emerging technology to support high-level decision making by gathering data from several distributed information sources into one repository. In dynamic environments, data warehouses must be maintained in order to stay consistent with the underlying sources. Recently proposed view maintenance algorithms tackle the problem of data warehouse maintenance under concurrent source data updates.While the view synchronization is to handle non-concurrent source schema changes. However, the concurrency between interleaved schema changes and data updates still remain unexplored problems.  In this paper, we propose a solution framework called DyDa that successfully addresses this problem. The DyDa framework detects concurrent schema changes by a broken query scheme and conicting concurrent data updates by a local timestamp scheme. A fundamental idea of the DyDa framework is the development of a two-layered architecture that separates the concerns for concurrent data updates and concurrent schema changes handling without imposing any restrictions on the sourse update transactions. At the lower level of the framework, it employs a local compensation algorithm to handle concurrent data updates, and a metadata name mapping strategy to handle concurrent source rename operations.

For the latter problem, we design a strategy for the detection and correction of such concurrency and nd an executable plan for the aected updates. We then develop a new view adaption algorithm, called Batch-VA for execution of such plan to incrementally adapt the view.

MIND-WARPING: Towards Creating a Compelling Collaborative Augmented Reality Game Computer gaming offers a unique test-bed and market for advanced concepts in computer science, such as Human Computer Interaction (HCI), computer-supported collaborative work (CSCW), intelligent agents, graphics, and sensing technology. In addition, computer gaming is especially wellsuited for explorations in the relatively young fields of wearable computing and augmented reality (AR). This paper presents a developing multi-player augmented reality game, patterned as a cross between a martial arts fighting game and an agent controller, as implemented using the Wearable Augmented Reality for Personal, Intelligent, and Networked Gaming (WARPING) system. Through interactions based on gesture, voice, and head movement input and audio and graphical output, the WARPING system demonstrates how computer vision techniques can be exploited for advanced, intelligent interfaces.

User Modelling as an Aid for Human Web This paper explores how user modelling can work as an aid for human assistants in a user support system for web sites. Information about the user can facilitate for the assistant the tailoring of the consultation to the individual needs of the user. Such information can be represented and structured in a user model made available for the assistant. A user modelling approach has been implemented and deployed in a real web environment as part of a user support system. Following the deployment we have analysed consultation dialogue logs and answers to a questionnaire for participating assistants. The initial results show that assistants consider user modelling to be helpful and that consultation dialogues can be an important source for user model data collection.

Using Common Hypertext Links to Identify the Best Phrasal Description of Target Web Documents This paper describes previous work which studied and compared the distribution of words in web documents with the distribution of words in "normal" flat texts. Based on the findings from this study it is suggested that the traditional IR techniques cannot be used for web search purposes the same way they are used for "normal" text collections, e.g. news articles. Then, based on these same findings, I will describe a new document description model which exploits valuable anchor text information provided on the web that is ignored by the traditional techniques.  The problem  Amitay (1997) has found, through a corpus analysis of a 1000 web pages that the lexical distribution in documents which were written especially for the web (home pages), is significantly different than the lexical distribution observed in a corpus of "normal" English language (the British National Corpus - 100,000,000 words).

Evaluating Functional Joins Along Nested Reference Sets in Object-Relational and Object-Oriented Databases Previous work on functional joins was constrained in two ways: (1) all approaches we know assume references being implemented as physical object identifiers (OIDs) and (2) most approaches are, in addition, limited to single-valued reference attributes. Both are severe limitations since most object-relational and all object-oriented database systems do support nested reference sets and many object systems do implement references as location-independent (logical) OIDs. In this work, we develop a new functional join algorithm that can be used for any realization form for OIDs (physical or logical) and is particularly geared towards supporting functional joins along nested reference sets. The algorithm can be applied to evaluate joins along arbitrarily long path expressions which may include one or more reference sets. The new algorithm generalizes previously proposed partition-based pointer joins by repeatedly applying partitioning with interleaved re-merging before evaluating the next fu...

Towards Visually Mediated Interaction using Appearance-Based Models . This paper reports initial research on supporting Visually Mediated Interaction  (VMI) by developing generic expression models and person-specific and  generic gesture models for the control of active cameras. We investigate the recognition  of both head pose and expression using simple generalisation of trained  generic models using Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks. Then we go on  to describe a time-delay variant (TDRBF) of the network and evaluate its performance  on recognising simple pointing and waving hand gestures in image sequences.  Experimental results are presented that show that high levels of performance  in gesture recognition can be obtained using these techniques, both for  particular individuals and across a set of individuals. Characteristic visual evidence  can be automatically selected and used even to recognise individuals from their  gestures, depending on the task demands.  1 Introduction  This paper reports initial research on supporting Visually Mediated ...

Collection and Exploitation of Expert Knowledge in Web Assistant Systems Recent research and commercial developments have highlighted the importance of human involvement in user support for web information systems. In our earlier work a web assistant system has been introduced, which is a hybrid support system with human web assistants and computer-based support. An important issue with web assistant systems is how to make optimal use of these support resources. We use a knowledge management approach with frequently asked questions for a question-answering system that acts as a question filter for the human assistants. Knowledge is continuously collected from the assistants and exploited to augment the question-answering capabilities. Our system has been deployed and evaluated by an analysis of conversation logs and questionnaires for users and assistants. The results show that our approach is feasible and useful. Lessons learned are summarised in a set of recommendations.

Searchable Words on the Web In designing data structures for text databases, it is valuable to know how many different words are likely to be encountered in a particular collection. For example, vocabulary accumulation is central to index construction for text database systems; it is useful to be able to estimate the space requirements and performance characteristics of the main-memory data structures used for this task. However, it is not clear how many distinct words will be found in a text collection or whether new words will continue to appear after inspecting large volumes of data. We propose practical definitions of a word, and investigate new word occurrences under these models in a large text collection. We inspected around two billion word occurrences in 45 gigabytes of world-wide web documents, and found just over 9.74 million different words in 5.5 million documents; overall, 1 word in 200 was new. We observe that new words continue to occur, even in very large data sets, and that choosing stricter definitions of what constitutes a word has only limited impact on the number of new words found.

Perceptual User Interfaces For some time, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have been the dominant platform for human computer interaction. The GUI-based style of interaction has made computers simpler and easier to use, especially for office productivity applications where computers are used as tools to accomplish specific tasks. However, as the way we use computers changes and computing becomes more pervasive and ubiquitous, GUIs will not easily support the range of interactions necessary to meet users ‚Äô needs. In order to accommodate a wider range of scenarios, tasks, users, and preferences, we need to move toward interfaces that are natural, intuitive, adaptive, and unobtrusive. The aim of a new focus in HCI, called Perceptual User Interfaces (PUIs), is to make human-computer interaction more like how people interact with each other and with the world. This paper describes the emerging PUI field and then reports on three PUImotivated projects: computer vision-based techniques to visually perceive relevant information about the user. 1.

Design & Specification of Dynamic, Mobile, and Reconfigurable Multiagent Systems Multiagent Systems use the power of collaborative software agents to solve complex distributed problems. There are many Agent-Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) methodologies available to assist system designers to create multiagent systems. However, none of these methodologies can specify agents with dynamic properties such as cloning, mobility or agent instantiation.  This thesis starts the process to bridge the gap between AOSE methodologies and dynamic agent platforms by incorporating mobility into the current Multiagent Systems Engineering (MaSE) methodology. Mobility was specified within all components composing a mobile agent class. An agent component was also created that integrated the behavior of the components within an agent class and was transformed to handle most of the move responsibilities for a mobile agent. Those agent component and component mobility transformations were integrated into agentTool as a proof-of-concept and a demonstration system built on the mobility specifications was implemented for execution on the Carolina mobile agent platform.  1  DESIGN & SPECIFICATION OF DYNAMIC, MOBILE, AND  RECONFIGURABLE MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS  I.

The Chromatic Structure of Natural Scenes We applied Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to hyperspectral images in  order to learn an ecient representation of color in natural scenes. In the spectra of  single pixels, the algorithm found basis functions that had broadband spectra, as well  as basis functions that were similar to natural reectance spectra. When applied to  small image patches, the algorithm found basis functions that were achromatic and  others with overall chromatic variation along lines in color space, indicating color  opponency. The directions of opponency were not strictly orthogonal. Comparison  1  with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the basis of statistical measures such as  average mutual information, kurtosis and entropy, shows that the ICA transformation  results in much sparser coecients and gives higher coding eciency. Our ndings  suggest that non-orthogonal opponent encoding of photoreceptor signals leads to  higher coding eciency, and that ICA may be used to reveal the underlying stati...

Using Unlabeled Data to Improve Text Classification One key difficulty with text classification learning algorithms is that they require many hand-labeled examples to learn accurately. This dissertation demonstrates that supervised learning algorithms that use a small number of labeled examples and many inexpensive unlabeled examples can create high-accuracy text classifiers. By assuming that documents are created by a parametric generative model, Expectation-Maximization (EM) finds local maximum a posteriori models and classifiers from all the data -- labeled and unlabeled. These generative models do not capture all the intricacies of text; however on some domains this technique substantially improves classification accuracy, especially when labeled data are sparse. Two problems arise from this basic approach. First, unlabeled data can hurt performance in domains where the generative modeling assumptions are too strongly violated. In this case the assumptions can be made more representative in two ways: by modeling sub-topic class structure, and by modeling super-topic hierarchical class relationships. By doing so, model probability and classification accuracy come into correspondence, allowing unlabeled data to improve classification performance. The second problem is that even with a representative model, the improvements given by unlabeled data do not sufficiently compensate for a paucity of labeled data. Here, limited labeled data provide EM initializations that lead to low-probability models. Performance can be significantly improved by using active learning to select high-quality initializations, and by using alternatives to EM that avoid low-probability local maxima.

Style Machines We approach the problem of stylistic motion synthesis by learning motion patterns from  a highly varied set of motion capture sequences. Each sequence may have a distinct  choreography, performed in a distinct style. Learning identifies common choreographic  elements across sequences, the different styles in which each element is performed, and  a small number of stylistic degrees of freedom which span the many variations in the  dataset. The learned model can synthesize novel motion data in any interpolation or  extrapolation of styles. For example, it can convert novice ballet motions into the more  graceful modern dance of an expert. The model can also be driven by video, by scripts,  or even by noise to generate new choreography and synthesize virtual motion-capture  in many styles.

A Java Application Framework for Agent Based Systems Agents are the next significant software abstraction, especially for distributed systems. Agent based systems have been developed in response to the following requirements: - Personalized and customized user interfaces that are pro-active in assisting the user - Adaptable, fault tolerant distributed systems that solve complex problems - Open systems where components come and go and new components are continually added. - Migration and load balancing across platforms, throughout a network. - New metaphors, such as negotiation, for solving distributed, multi- disciplinary problems. Agents appear in a wide range of applications, but all agent development to date has been done independently by each development team. This has led to several problems, including i) duplication of effort, ii) inability to satisfy industrial strength requirements for security and scalability, and iii) incompatibility of agent systems.

Process- and Agent-Based Modelling Techniques for Dialogue Systems and Virtual Environments This text presents results of ongoing research, which is aimed at developing a framework for developing multimodal natural language dialogue systems operating within virtual environments. The aspects of multimodality and presence in a virtual environment are chosen as the main focus of this research. It may be argued that specification techniques would form the basis of such a framework. Therefore, a general overview and evaluation is given of existing specification techniques for interactive systems, based on both literature and previous research results. This includes the object-oriented model, process algebras, interactor models, and agent systems. Agent systems are further subdivided into intentional logics, production rule systems, agent communication languages, agent platforms, and agent architectures. A new agent system is proposed, which is based on update notification mechanisms as found in interactor models, and the `facilitator' function as found in some agent platfo...

Using an Expressive Description Logic: FaCT or Fiction? Description Logics form a family of formalisms closely related to semantic networks but with the distinguishing characteristic that the semantics of the concept description language is formally defined, so that the subsumption relationship between two concept descriptions can be computed by a suitable algorithm. Description Logics have proved useful in a range of applications but their wider acceptance has been hindered by their limited expressiveness and the intractability of their subsumption algorithms. This paper addresses both these issues by describing a sound and complete tableaux subsumption testing algorithm for a relatively expressive Description Logic which, in spite of the logic's worst case complexity, has been shown to perform well in realistic applications. 1 INTRODUCTION Description Logics (DLs) form a family of formalisms which have grown out of knowledge representation techniques using frames and semantic networks

A General Framework for Evolving Schemata Support . In this paper a semantic approach for the specication and the management of  databases with evolving schemata is introduced. It is shown how a general object-oriented  model for schema versioning and evolution can be formalised; how the semantics of schema  change operations can be dened; how interesting reasoning tasks can be supported, based  on an encoding in description logics.  1 Introduction  The problems of schema evolution and versioning arose in the context of long-lived database applications, where stored data were considered worth surviving changes in the database schema [23]. According to a widely accepted terminology [19], a database supports schema evolution if it permits modications of the schema without the loss of extant data; in addition, it supports schema versioning if it allows the querying of all data through user-denable version interfaces. For the sake of brevity, schema evolution can be considered as a special case of schema versioning where only the curr...

General Principles Of Learning-Based Multi-Agent Systems We consider the problem of how to design large decentralized multi-agent systems (MAS‚Äôs) in an automated fashion, with little or no hand-tuning. Our approach has each agent run a reinforcement learning algorithm. This converts the problem into one of how to automatically set/update the reward functions for each of the agents so that the global goal is achieved. In particular we do not want the agents to ‚Äúwork at cross-purposes ‚Äù as far as the global goal is concerned. We use the term artificial COllective INtelligence (COIN) to refer to systems that embody solutions to this problem. In this paper we present a summary of a mathematical framework for COINs. We then investigate the real-world applicability of the core concepts of that framework via two computer experiments: we show that our COINs perform near optimally in a difficult variant of Arthur‚Äôs bar problem [1] (and in particular avoid the tragedy of the commons for that problem), and we also illustrate optimal performance for our COINs in the leader-follower problem. 1

Nudge Nudge Wink Wink: Elements of Face-to-Face Conversation for Embodied Conversational Agents Introduction  Only humans communicate using language and carry on conversations with one another. And the skills of conversation have developed in humans in such a way as to exploit all of the unique affordances of the human body. We make complex representational gestures with our prehensile hands, gaze away and towards one another out of the corners of our centrally set eyes, and use the pitch and melody of our voices to emphasize and clarify what we are saying. Perhaps because conversation is so defining of humanness and human interaction, the metaphor of face-to-face conversation has been applied to human-computer interface design for quite some time. One of the early arguments for the utility of this metaphor gave a list of features of face-to-face conversation that could be applied fruitfully to human-computer interaction, including mixed initiative, nonverbal communication, sense of presence, rules for transfer of control (Nickerson 1976). However, although these feature

Temporal Interpolation Of Video Sequences Using Zonal Based Algorithms Temporal interpolation has been recently proposed as a solution for increasing temporal resolution or even for predicting missing or corrupted frames within a video sequence. In this paper new techniques on temporal interpolation are presented, by mainly exploiting properties of the very popular and highly efficient zonal based motion estimation algorithms, and by introducing several other techniques such as multihypothesis motion compensation, motion classification and temporal/spatial filtering. In addition we further give an analysis on when temporal interpolation should be employed, thus possibly avoiding unwanted artifacts created from this process, while at the same time significantly improving the overall performance of the interpolation.

These concepts are denoted by the phrases informationally incremental learning and operationally incremental learning, respectively. Roughly spoken, informationally incremental algorithms are required to work incrementally as usual, i.e. they have no permission to look back at the whole history of information presented during the learning process. Operationally incremental learning algorithms may have permission to look back, but they are not allowed to use information of the past in some effective way. ...

The first experiment  compared the effects of four  different haptic augmentations on  user performance in a simple  targeting task. The second  experiment involved a more  ecologically oriented searching and  scrolling task. Results indicated that  the haptic effects did not improve  users performance in terms of task  completion time. However, the  number of errors made was  significantly reduced.

More Than Just Another Pretty Face: Embodied Conversational Interface Agents this article I describe some of the features of human-human conversation that are being implemented in this new genre of embodied conversational agents. Then I describe an embodied conversational agent that is based on these features. I argue that, because conversation is such a primary skill for humans, and such an early-learned skill (practiced, in fact, between infants and mothers who take turns cooing and burbling at one another), and because the body is so well-equipped to support conversation, embodied conversational agents may turn out to be powerful ways for humans to interact with their computers. However, I claim that in order for embodied conversational agents to live up to their promise, their implementations must be based on actual study of human -- human conversation, and their architectures must reflect some of the intrinsic properties found there. Embodied conversational interfaces are not just computer interfaces represented by way of human or animal bodies. And they are not just interfaces where those human or animal bodies are lifelike or believable in their actions and their reactions to human users. Embodied conversational interfaces are specifically conversational in their behaviors, and specifically human-like in the way they use their bodies in conversation. That is, embodied conversational agents may be defined as those that have the same properties as humans in face-to-face conversation, including:

Beyond Best Effort: Router Architectures for the Differentiated Services of Tomorrow's Internet With the transformation of the Internet to a commercial infrastructure, the ability to provide differentiated services to users with widely varying requirements is rapidly becoming as important as meeting the massive increases in bandwidth demand. Hence, while deploying routers, switches, and transmission systems of ever increasing capacity, Internet Service Providers would also like toprovide customer specific differentiated services using the same shared network infrastructure. In this paper, we describe router architectures that can support the two trends of rising bandwidth demand and rising demand for differentiated services. We focus on router mechanisms that can support differentiated services at a level not being contemplated in proposals currently under consideration due to concern regarding their implementability at high-speeds. We consider the types of differentiated services that service providers may want to offer and then discuss the mechanisms needed in routers to support them. We describe plausible implementations of these mechanisms (the scalability and performance of which have been demonstrated by implementation in a prototype system) and argue that it is technologically possible to raise considerably the level of differentiated services that service providers can offer their customers, and that it is not necessary to restrict differentiated services to rudimentary offerings even in very high-speed networks.

An Extensible and Scalable Content Adaptation Pipeline Architecture to Support Heterogeneous Clients The importance of middleware and content adaptation has previously been demonstrated for pervasive use of Web-based applications. In this paper we propose a modular, extensible, and scalable middleware component called the Content Adaptation Pipeline that performs content adaptation on arbitrarily complex data types not limited to text and graphic images. Furthermore, the architecture can be used as part of many client-server applications, not just Web browsers. In our work we leverage the XML language as a uniform means to describe all the elements in our architecture, including the client device and user profiles, the data characteristics, the transcoding operations performed on the data, and the resultant adapted data. We illustrate the flexibility of our architecture to support new data types and adaptation operations by first showing its use with data from a real-world medical application and then extending its capabilities to handle animated graphics and also real-time streaming RTP data. Finally, we demonstrate scalability in our architecture by executing the Content Adaptation Pipeline over a distributed set of servers running an efficient protocol.

What semiotics can and cannot do for HCI Semiotics is "the mathematics of the humanities" in the sense that it provides an abstract language covering a diversity of special sign-usages (language, pictures, movies, theatre, etc.). In this capacity, semiotics is helpful for bringing insights from older media to the task of interface design, and for defining the special characteristics of the computer medium. However, semiotics is not limited to interface design but may also contribute to the proper design of program texts and yield predictions about the interaction between computer systems and their context of use.

Design Principles For Resource Management Systems For Intelligent Spaces The idea of ubiquitous computing and smart environments is no longer a dream and has long become a serious area of research and soon this technology will start entering our every day lives. There are two major obstacles that prevent this technology from spreading. First, di#erent smart spaces are equipped with very di#erent kinds of devices (e.g. a projector vs. a computer monitor, vs. a TV set). Second, multiple applications running in a space at the same time inevitably contend for those devices and other scarce resources. The underlying software in a smart space needs to provide tools for self-adaptivity in that it shields the rest of the software from the physical constraints of the space, and that it dynamically adjusts the allocation of scarce resources as the number and priorities of active tasks change.

Multi-Document Summarization and Visualization in the Informedia Digital Video Library The Informedia Digital Video Library project provided a technological foundation for full content indexing and retrieval of video and audio media. The library now contains over 2000 hours of video and is growing daily. A good query engine is not sufficient for information retrieval because often the candidate result sets grow in number as the library grows. Video digests summarize sets of stories from the library, providing users with a visual mechanism for interactive browsing and query refinement. These digests are generated dynamically under the direction of the user based on automatically derived metadata from the video library.

Despite  the interest in PRS and BDI agents, no complete attempt has yet been made  to precisely specify the behaviour of real PRS systems.

Agent-Oriented Requirements Engineering Using ConGolog and i* : Agent-oriented approaches are becoming popular in software engineering, both as architectural frameworks, and as modeling frameworks for requirements engineering and design. i* is an informal diagram-based language for early-phase requirements engineering that supports the modeling of social dependencies between agents and how process design choices affect the agents' goals both functional and non-functional. ConGolog is an expressive logic-based formalism for specifying processes that involves multiple agents. Tools are being developed to support the validation of ConGolog process models though simulation and verification. The two formalisms complement each other well, and in this work, we develop a methodology for their combined use in requirements engineering. The i* SR-diagram language is extended with process specification annotations, which allow the SR model of a system to be refined and then mapped into a ConGolog model. The mapping must satisfy a set of mapping rules, which ensure that it specifies which elements in the two models are related and that the models are consistent. The methodology is illustrated on a meeting scheduling application example. 1

Query Evaluation for Mediators over Web Catalogs The Web catalogs like Yahoo! and Open Directory  are very useful for browsing and querying the Web. Although  they index only a fraction of the pages that are indexed by search  engines these catalogs are hand-crafted by domain experts and  are therefore of high quality. We present a model for building  mediators over Web catalogs, so as to provide users with customized   views of such catalogs. We focus on query evaluation,  specifically on the complexity of query answering by the mediator.

An Expert System for Analyzing Firewall Rules When deploying firewalls in an organization, it is essential to verify that the firewalls are configured properly. The problem of finding out what a given firewall configuration does occurs, for instance, when a new network administrator takes over, or a third party performs a technical security audit for the organization. While the problem can be approached via testing, non-intrusive techniques are often preferred. Existing tools for analyzing firewall configurations usually rely on hard-coded algorithms for analyzing access lists. In this paper we present a tool based on constraint logic programming (CLP) which allows the user to write higher level operations for, e.g., detecting common configuration mistakes. Our tool understands Cisco router access lists, and it is implemented using Eclipse, a constraint logic programming language. The problem of analyzing firewall configurations lends itself quite naturally to be solved by an expert system. We found it surprisingly easy to use logic statements to express knowledge on networking, firewalls, and common configuration mistakes, for instance. Using an existing generic inference engine allowed us to focus on defining the core concepts and relationships in the knowledge base. 1

Information-Passing and Belief Revision in Multi-Agent Systems We define a programming language for multi-agent systems in which agents interact with a common environment and cooperate by exchanging their individual beliefs on the environment. In handling the information they acquire, the agents employ operations to expand, remove and update their individual belief bases. The overall framework, which generalizes traditional concurrent programming concepts, is parameterized by an information system of constraints. Such a system is used to represent the environment as well as the beliefs of the agents. We give the syntax of the programming language and develop an operational semantics in terms of a transition system.  1. Introduction and syntax  A lot of effort has been made in the development of programming languages for multi-agent systems that cover typical agent concepts as beliefs, desires, intentions, commitments, speech acts, communication, cooperation and so on. However, in our opinion, most of the concurrency aspects of the existing multi-a...

Logic-based Genetic Programming with Definite Clause Translation Grammars DCTG-GP is a genetic programming system that uses definite clause translation grammars. A DCTG is a logical version of an attribute grammar that supports the definition of context--free languages, and it allows semantic information associated with a language to be easily accomodated by the grammar. This is useful in genetic programming for defining the interpreter of a target language, or incorporating both syntactic and semantic problem--specific contraints into the evolutionary search. The DCTG-GP system improves on other grammar--based GP systems by permitting non--trivial semantic aspects of the language to be defined with the grammar. It also automatically analyzes grammar rules in order to determine their minimal depth and termination characteristics, which are required when generating random program trees of varied shapes and sizes. An application using DCTG-GP is described. 1 INTRODUCTION  Genetic programming (GP) implementations have benefitted from simple program denotations....

An Intelligent Multi-Agent Architecture for Information Retrieval from the Internet The World Wide Web (WWW) offers an uncountable number of documents which deal with information from a neverending list of topics. Thus the question of whether to find information turned into a question of how to find relevant information. Search engines with crawler based indexes vary in recall and offer a very bad precision. Meta search engines try to overcome these lacks based upon a specialised monolithic architecture for information extraction, information filtering and integration of heterogenous information resources. Few search engines employ intelligent techniques in order to increase precision. On the other hand, user modeling techniques become more and more popular. Many personalized agent based system for web browsing are currently developed. It is a straightforward idea to incorporate the idea of user modeling with machine learning methods into web search services.

Designing StoryRooms: Interactive Storytelling Spaces for Children Limited access to space, costly props, and complicated authoring technologies are among the many reasons why children can rarely enjoy the experience of authoring roomsized interactive stories. Typically in these kinds of environments, children are restricted to being story participants, rather than story authors. Therefore, we have begun the development of "StoryRooms," room-sized immersive storytelling experiences for children. With the use of low-tech and high-tech storytelling elements, children can author physical storytelling experiences to share with other children.

Database Replication Using Epidemic Update Due to severe performance penalties associated with synchronous replication, there is an increasing  interest in asynchronous replica management protocols in which database transactions are executed locally,  and the effects of these transactions are incorporated asynchronously on remote database copies.  However, the asynchronous protocols currently in use either do not guarantee consistency and serializability  as needed by transactional semantics or they impose restrictions on placement of data and on which  data objects can be updated. In this paper we investigate an epidemic update protocol that guarantees  consistency and serializability in spite of a write-anywhere capability. We conducted experiments on a detailed  simulation of a distributed, replicated database to evaluate this protocol. Our results establish that  this epidemic approach is indeed a viable alternative to traditional eager update protocols for a distributed  database environment where consistency and full seri...

Adding Generic Contextual Capabilities to Wearable Computers Context-awareness has an increasingly important role to play in the development of wearable computing systems. In order to better define this role we have identified four generic contextual capabilities: sensing, adaptation, resource discovery, and augmentation. A prototype application has been constructed to explore how some of these capabilities could be deployed in a wearable system designed to aid an ecologist's observations of giraffe in a Kenyan game reserve. However, despite the benefits of context-awareness demonstrated in this prototype, widespread innovation of these capabilities is currently stifled by the difficulty in obtaining the contextual data. To remedy this situation the Contextual Information Service (CIS) is introduced. Installed on the user's wearable computer, the CIS provides a common point of access for clients to obtain, manipulate and model contextual information independently of the underlying plethora of data formats and sensor interface mechanisms.  1.

It uses the pair gene dependencies in order to improve algorithms that use simple univariate marginal distributions. BMDA is a special case of the Factorization Distribution Algorithm, but without any problem specic knowledge in the initial stage. The dependencies are being discovered during the optimization process itself. In this paper BMDA is described in detail. BMDA is compared to dierent algorithms including the simple genetic algorithm with dierent crossover methods and UMDA.

Evaluating Stereo and Motion Cues for Visualizing Information Nets in Three Dimensions This article concerns the benefits of presenting abstract data in 3D. Two experiments show that motion cues combined with stereo viewing can substantially increase the size of tbe graph that can be perceived. The first experiment was designed to provide quantitative measurements of how much more (or less) can be understood in 3D than in 2D. Tbe 3D display used was configured so that the image on the monitor was coupled to the user‚Äôs actual eye positions (and it was updated in real-time as the user moved) as well as being in stereo. Thus the effect was like a local ‚Äúvirtual reality ‚Äù display located in the vicinity of the computer monitor. The results from this study show that head-coupled stereo viewing can increase the size of an abstract graph that can be understood by a factor of three; using stereo alone provided an increase by a factor of 1.6 and bead coupling alone produced an increase by a factor of 2.2, Tbe second experiment examined a variety of motion cues provided by head-coupled perspective (as in virtual reality displays), hand-guided motion and automatic rotation, respectively, both with and without stereo in each case. The results show that structured 3D motion and stereo viewing both help in understanding, but that the kind of motion is not particularly important; all improve performance, and all are more significant than stereo cues. These results provide strong reasons for using advanced 3D graphics for interacting with a large variety of information structures.

Individual Learning of Coordination Knowledge Social agents, both human and computational, inhabiting a world con-taining multiple active agents, need to coordinate their activities. This is because agents share resources, and without proper coordination or ‚Äúrules of the road‚Äù, everybody will be interfering with the plans of others. As such, we need coordination schemes that allow agents to effectively achieve local goals without adversely affecting the problem-solving capabilities of other agents. Researchers in the field of Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) have de-veloped a variety of coordination schemes under different assumptions about agent capabilities and relationships. Whereas some of these research have been motivated by human cognitive biases, others have approached it as an engineering problem of designing the most effective coordination architec-ture or protocol. We evaluate individual and concurrent learning by mul-tiple, autonomous agents as a means for acquiring coordination knowledge. We show that a uniform reinforcement learning algorithm suffices as a coor-dination mechanism in both cooperative and adversarial situations. Using a number of multiagent learning scenarios with both tight and loose coupling between agents and with immediate as well as delayed feedback, we demon-strate that agents can consistently develop effective policies to coordinate their actions without explicit information sharing. We demonstrate the vi-ability of using both the Q-learning algorithm and genetic algorithm based classifier systems with different payoff schemes, namely the bucket brigade algorithm (BBA) and the profit sharing plan (PSP), for developing agent coordination on two different multi-agent domains. In addition, we show that a semi-random scheme for action selection is preferable to the more traditional fitness proportionate selection scheme used in classifier systems. 1 1

Pushing Reactive Services to XML Repositories using Active Rules Push technology, i.e., the ability of sending relevant information to clients in reaction to new events, is a fundamental aspect of modern information systems; XML is rapidly emerging as the widely adopted standard for information exchange and representation and hence, several XML-based protocols have been defined and are the object of investigation at W3C and throughout commercial organizations. In this paper, we propose the new concept of active XML rules for "pushing" reactive services to XML-enabled repositories. Rules operate on XML documents and deliver information to interested remote users in reaction to update events occurring at the repository site. The proposed mechanism assumes the availability of XML repositories supporting a standard XML query language, such as XQuery that is being developed by the W3C; for the implementation of the reactive components, it capitalizes on the use of standard DOM events and of the SOAP interchange standard to enable the remote installation of active rules. A simple protocol is proposed for subscribing and unsubscribing remote rules.

Lossless Regular Views If the only information we have on a certain database is through a set of views, the question arises of whether this is sufficient to answer completely a given query. We say that the set of views is lossless with respect to the query, if, no matter what the database is, we can answer the query by solely relying on the content of the views. The question of losslessness has various applications, for example in query optimization, mobile computing, data warehousing, and data integration. We study this problem in a context where the database is semistructured, and both the query and the views are expressed as regular path queries. The form of recursion present in this class prevents us from applying known results to our case.

Querying the Physical World Data Type (ADT) objects that are single attribute values encapsulating a collection of related data [S98]. Note that there are natural parallels between devices and ADTs.

The public interface of the ADT corresponds to the specific functions supported by the device. An actual ADT object in the database corresponds to a physical device in the real world.

Forming Neural Networks through Efficient and Adaptive Coevolution This article demonstrates the advantages of a cooperative, coevolutionary search in difficult control problems. The SANE system coevolves a population of neurons that cooperate to form a functioning neural network. In this process, neurons assume different but overlapping roles, resulting in a robust encoding of control behavior. SANE is shown to be more efficient, more adaptive, and maintain higher levels of diversity than the more common network-based population approaches. Further empirical studies illustrate the emergent neuron specializations and the different roles the neurons assume in the population. 1 Introduction  Artificial evolution has become an increasingly popular method for forming control policies in difficult decision problems (Grefenstette, Ramsey, & Schultz, 1990; Moriarty & Miikkulainen, 1996a; Whitley, Dominic, Das, & Anderson, 1993).

AdaBoost for Query-by-Example in Text This paper describes an implementation of query-by-example, or relevance  feedback, for text.

If the user  requires more information, the user may score documents in the result  set as relevant or irrelevant. An implementation of the AdaBoost algorithm  is then used choose words that separate the relevant documents  from a random document set. Examples of negative document sets are  also tested. An example query and refinements of the query is presented.  The results seem promising. The system seems to propose new keywords  that are sensible to the requested context. Many of the keywords prove  useful in constructing new queries. However, refinement using exactly  the new terms predicted by the system does not seem to return noticeably  better or worse results. This may be the result of an inexact fit  between the design of AdaBoost and the capabilities of Google as a back  end engine. ...

Automated Robot Behavior Recognition Applied to Robotic Soccer Automated recognition of the behavior of robots is increasingly needed in a variety of tasks, as we develop more autonomous robots and general information processing agents. For example, in environments with multiple autonomous robots, a robot may need to make decisions based on the behavior of the other robots. As another interesting example, an intelligent narrator agent observing a robot will need to automatically identify the robot's behaviors. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to represent and recognize strategic behaviors of robotic agents. We first introduce and characterize the perceived signal in terms of behavioral-relevant state features. We then show how several HMMs capture different defined robot behaviors.

(LP)2, an Adaptive Algorithm for Information Extraction from Web-related Texts (LP)  2  is an algorithm for adaptive Information  Extraction from Web-related text that induces  symbolic rules by learning from a corpus tagged  with SGML tags. Induction is performed by  bottom-up generalisation of examples in a  training corpus. Training is performed in two  steps: initially a set of tagging rules is learned;  then additional rules are induced to correct  mistakes and imprecision in tagging. Shallow  NLP is used to generalise rules beyond the flat  word structure. Generalization allows a better  coverage on unseen texts, as it limits data  sparseness and overfitting in the training phase.  In experiments on publicly available corpora the  algorithm outperforms any other algorithm  presented in literature and tested on the same  corpora. Experiments also show a significant  gain in using NLP in terms of (1) effectiveness  (2) reduction of training time and (3) training  corpus size. In this paper we present the  machine learning algorithm for rule induction.  In particular we focus on the NLP-based  generalisation and the strategy for pruning both  the search space and the final rule set.  1.

State-Based SHOSLIF for Indoor Visual Navigation In this paper, we investigate vision-based navigation using the Self-organizing Hierarchical Optimal Subspace Learning and Inference Framework (SHOSLIF) that incorporates states and a visual attention mechanism. The problem is formulated as an observation-driven Markov model (ODMM) which is realized through recursive partitioning regression. A stochastic recursive partition tree (SRPT), which maps an preprocessed current input raw image and the previous state into the current state and the next control signal, is used for efficient recursive partitioning regression. The SRPT learns incrementally: each learning sample is learned or rejected "onthe -fly". The proposed scheme has been successfully applied to indoor navigation.

Learning Search Engine Specific Query Transformations for Question Answering We introduce a method for learning query transformations that improves the ability to retrieve answers to questions from an information retrieval system. During the training stage the method involves automatically learning phrase features for classifying questions into different types, automatically generating candidate query transformations from a training set of question/answer pairs, and automatically evaluating the candidate transforms on target information retrieval systems such as real-world general purpose search engines. At run time, questions are transformed into a set of queries, and re-ranking is performed on the documents retrieved.

Greedy strikes back: Improved Facility Location Algorithms A fundamental facility location problem is to choose the location of facilities, such as industrial plants and warehouses, to minimize the cost of satisfying the demand for some commodity.

It is trained by presenting manually indexed video sequences. To improve the system we use a video model, that allows the classification of complex video sequences.

Cost-based Query Scrambling for Initial Delays Remote data access from disparate sources across a wide-area network such as the Internet is problematic due to the unpredictable nature of the communications medium and the lack of knowledge about the load and potential delays at remote sites. Traditional, static, query processing approaches break down in this environment because they are unable to adapt in response to unexpected delays. Query scrambling has been proposed to address this problem. Scrambling modifies query execution plans on-the-fly when delays are encountered during runtime. In its original formulation, scrambling was based on simple heuristics, which although providing good performance in many cases, were also shown to be susceptible to problems resulting from bad scrambling decisions. In this paper we address these shortcomings by investigating ways to exploit query optimization technology to aid in making intelligent scrambling choices. We propose three different approaches to using query optimization for scramblin...

Consistent Query Answers in Inconsistent Databases In this paper we consider the problem of the logical characterization of the notion of consistent answer in a relational database that may violate given integrity constraints. This notion is captured in terms of the possible repaired versions of the database. A method for computing consistent answers is given and its soundness and completeness (for some classes of constraints and queries) proved. The method is based on an iterative procedure whose termination for several classes of constraints is proved as well. 1 Introduction  Integrity constraints capture an important normative aspect of every database application. However, it is often the case that their satisfaction cannot be guaranteed, allowing for the existence of inconsistent database instances. In that case, it is important to know which query answers are consistent with the integrity constraints and which are not.

A Component-Based Approach for Integrating Mobile Agents Into the Existing Web Infrastructure Mobile agents provide a new abstraction for deploying functionality over the existing internet infrastructure. During the last two years, we have been working on a project that tries to overcome some of the limitations found in terms of programmability and usability of the mobile agent paradigm in real applications. In the M&M framework there are no agent platforms. Instead applications become agent-enabled by using simple JavaBeans components. In this paper we present an architecture that allows currently available web servers to become capable of sending and receiving agents in an easy way. By using this approach, existing web infrastructure can be maintained, while gaining a whole new potential by being able to make use of agent technology. Our approach involves wrapping the components inside a Java servlet that can be included in any web server supporting the Servlet Specification. This servlet enables the servers to receive and send agents that can query local information, and also enables the agents to behave as servlets themselves.

The influence of design techniques on user interfaces: the DigiStrips experiment for air traffic control Graphical user interfaces have limitations in terms of the information bandwidth they provide between users and systems. This can impede the redesign of systems previously based on more physical media: information may be less appropriately displayed, and shared cognition between users can be reduced. However, in parallel with research on new user interaction techniques, a more systematic use of visual design  techniques can relieve those limitations. This article  explores some of those techniques and how they can be applied, through a design experiment. Virtuosi and DigiStrips are two user interface prototypes developed within a research program on air traffic control workstations, which make use of touch screens and served as a basis for research on the use of graphical design techniques in user interfaces.

A prediction system for multimedia pre-fetching in Internet The rapid development of Interact has resulted in more and more multimedia in Web content. However, due to the limitation in the bandwidth and huge size of the multimedia data, users always suffer from long time waiting. On the other hand, if we can predict the web object or page that the user most likely will view next while the user is viewing the current page, and pre-fetch the content, then the perceived network latency can be significantly reduced. In this paper, we present an n-gram based model to utilize path profiles of users from very large web log to predict the users ' future requests. Our model is based on a simple extension of existing point-based models for such predictions, but our results show that by sacrificing the applicability somewhat one can gain a great deal in prediction precision. Also we present an efficient method to compress the prediction model size so that it can be fitted into the main memory. Our result can potentially be applied to a wide range of applications on the web, including pre-fetehing, enhancement of recommendation systems as well as web caching policies. The experiments based on three realistic web logs have proved the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

In this paper we will describe the  process of extracting and classifying information from the WWW for the purpose of integrating  it into digital libraries. Our eorts focus on ways to automatically classify news articles according  to whether they present opinions or reported facts. We describe and evaluate a system in  development that automatically classies and recommends Web news articles from sports and  politics domains.  1

Learned Models for Continuous Planning We are interested in the nature of activity -- structured behavior of nontrivial duration -- in intelligent agents. We believe that the development of activity is a continual process in which simpler activities are composed, via planning, to form more sophisticated ones in a hierarchical fashion. The success or failure of a planner depends on its models of the environment, and its ability to implement its plans in the world. We describe an approach to generating dynamical models of activity from real-world experiences and explain how they can be applied towards planning in a continuous state space. 1 Introduction  We are interested in the problem of how activity emerges in an intelligent agent. We believe that activity plays a critical role in the development of many high-level cognitive structures: classes, concepts, and language, to name a few. Thus, it is our goal to derive and implement a theory of the development of activity in intelligent agents and implement it using the Pioneer...

Interactive Query and Search in Semistructured Databases Semistructured graph-based databases have been proposed as well-suited stores for World-Wide Web data. Yet so far, languages for querying such data are too complex for casual Web users. Further, proposed query approaches do not take advantage of the interactivity of typical Web sessions---users are proficient at iteratively refining their Web explorations. In this paper we propose a new model for interactively querying and searching semistructured databases. Users can begin with a simple keyword search, dynamically browse the structure of the result, and then submit further refining queries. Enabling this model exposes new requirements of a semistructured database that are not apparent under traditional database uses. We demonstrate the importance of efficient keyword search, structural summaries of query results, and support for inverse pointers. We also describe some preliminary solutions to these technical issues. 1 Introduction Querying the Web has understandably gathered much att...

Adaptive Information Extraction and Sublanguage Analysis Introduction  1  Information extraction (IE) has made significant progress in the last decade. We have developed practical, efficient approaches to IE which have yielded modest levels of performance on general texts and quite good performance on restricted, `semi-structured' texts. More notably, over the last few years there has been a blossoming of work in adaptive IE --- the topic of this and other recent workshops --- IE systems which can be rapidly and automatically (or semi-automatically) moved to new extraction tasks.  To date, these developments have been relatively little influenced by linguistic studies of the texts. In fact, the trend has been towards less linguistic analysis. Some early IE systems used full parsing and in a few cases relatively deep semantic analysis. Because of limitations of full parsing methods (particularly a decade ago) this gave way to a common methodology based on limited parsing and simple pattern matching. Adaptive IE systems have in

Adaptive Retrieval Agents: Internalizing Local Context and Scaling up to the Web . This paper focuses on two machine learning abstractions springing from ecological models: (i) evolutionary adaptation by local selection, and (ii) selective query expansion by internalization of environmental signals. We first outline a number of experiments pointing to the feasibility and performance of these methods on a general class of graph environments. We then describe how these methods have been applied to the intelligent retrieval of information distributed across networked environments. In particular, the paper discusses a novel distributed evolutionary algorithm and representation used to construct populations of adaptive Web agents. These InfoSpiders search on-line for information relevant to the user, by traversing hyperlinks in an autonomous and intelligent fashion. They can adapt to the spatial and temporal regularities of their local context. Our results suggest that InfoSpiders could complement current search engine technology by starting up where search engines stop...

A Behavioral Interface to Simulate Agent-Object Interactions in Real Time This paper shows a new approach to model and control interactive objects for simulations with virtual human  agents when real time interactivity is essential. A general conceptualization is made to model objects with behaviors that can provide: information about their functionality, changes in appearance from parameterized deformations, and a complete plan for each possible interaction with a virtual human. Such behaviors are  described with simple primitive commands, following the actual trend of many standard scene graph file formats that connects language with movements and events to create interactive animations. In our case, special attention is given to correctly interpret object behaviors in parallel: situation that arrives when many human  agents interact at the same time with one same object.

Charm: An I/O-Driven Execution Strategy for High-Performance Transaction Processing The performance of a transaction processing system whose database is not completely  memory-resident critically depends on the amount of physical disk I/O required. This  paper describes a high-performance transaction processing system called Charm, which  aims to reducing the concurrency control overhead by minimizing the performance impacts  of disk I/O on lock contention delay. In existing transaction processing systems, a  transaction blocked by lock contention is forced to wait while the transaction currently  holding the contended lock is performing physical disk I/O. A substantial portion of a  transaction's lock contention delay is thus attributed to disk I/Os performed by other  transactions. Charm implements a two-stage transaction execution (TSTE) strategy,  which makes sure that all the data pages that a transaction needs be memory-resident  before it is allowed to lock database pages. Moreover, Charm supports an optimistic  version of the TSTE strategy (OTSTE), which furth...

Query Processing over Device Networks In the next decade, millions of sensors and small-scale mobile devices will integrate processors, memory, and communication capabilities.  Networks of devices will be widely deployed for monitoring applications. In these new applications, users need to query very large collections of  devices in an ad hoc manner. Most existing systems rely on a centralized system for collecting device data. These systems lack flexibility because  data is extracted in a predefined way. Also, they do not scale to a large number of devices because large volumes of raw data are transferred.  In our new concept of a device database system, distributed query execution techniques are applied to leverage the computing capabilities of  devices, and to reduce communication. In this article, we define an abstraction that allows us to represent a device network as a database  and we describe how distributed query processing techniques are applied in this new context.

Specifying Rational Agents with Statecharts and Utility Functions Abstract. To aid the development of the robotic soccer simulation league team RoboLog-2000, a method for the specification of multi-agent teams by statecharts has been introduced. The results in the last years competitions showed that though the team was competitive, it did not behave adaptive in unknown situations. The design of adaptive agents with this method is possible, but not in a straightforward manner. The purpose of this paper is to extend the approach by a more adaptive action selection mechanism and to facilitate a more explicit representation of goals of an agent. 1

Semantics for an Agent Communication Language . We address the issue of semantics for an agent communication language. In particular, the semantics of Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML) is investigated. KQML is a language and protocol to support communication between (intelligent) software agents. Based on ideas from speech act theory, we present a semantic description for KQML that associates "cognitive" states of the agent with the use of the language's primitives (performatives). We have used this approach to describe the semantics for the whole set of reserved KQML performatives. Our research offers a method for a speech act theory-based semantic description of a language of communication acts. Languages of communication acts address the issue of communication between software applications at a level of abstraction that could prove particularly useful to the emerging software agents paradigm of software design and development. 1 Introduction This research is concerned with communication between software agents [13]...

A SNoW-Based Face Detector A novel learning approach for human face detection using a network of linear units is presented. The SNoW learning architecture is a sparse network of linear functions over a pre-defined or incrementally learned feature space and is specifically tailored for learning in the presence of a very large number of features. A wide range of face images in different poses, with different expressions and under different lighting conditions are used as a training set to capture the variations of human faces. Experimental results on commonly used benchmark data sets of a wide range of face images show that the SNoW-based approach outperforms methods that use neural networks, Bayesian methods, support vector machines and others. Furthermore, learning and evaluation using the SNoW-based method are significantly more efficient than with other methods.

Dynamic Modeling and Learning User Profile In Personalized News Agent Finding relevant information effectively on the Internet is a challenging task. Although the information is widely available, exploring Web sites and finding information relevant to a user's interest can be a time-consuming and tedious task. As a result, many software agents have been employed to perform autonomous information gathering and filtering on behalf of the user. One of the critical issues in such an agent is the capability of the agent to model its users and adapt itself over time to changing user interests. In this thesis, a novel scheme is proposed to learn user profile. The proposed scheme is designed to handle multiple domains of long-term and short-term users' interests simultaneously, which are learned through positive and negative user feedback. A 3-descriptor interest category representation approach is developed to achieve this objective. Using such a representation, the learning algorithm is derived by imitating human personal assistants doing the same task. Based on experimental evaluation, the scheme performs very well and adapts quickly to significant changes in user interest.

Learning Visual Models of Social Engagement We introduce a face detector for wearable computers that exploits constraints in face scale and orientation imposed by the proximity of participants in near social interactions. Using this method we describe a wearable system that perceives "social engagement," i.e., when the wearer begins to interact with other individuals. Our experimental system proved > 90% accurate when tested on wearable video data captured at a professional conference. Over 300 individuals were captured during social engagement, and the data was separated into independent training and test sets. A metric for balancing the performance of face detection, localization, and recognition in the context of a wearable interface is discussed.  Recognizing social engagement with a user's wearable computer provides context data that can be useful in determining when the user is interruptible. In addition, social engagement detection may be incorporated into a user interface to improve the quality of mobile face recognition software. For example, the user may cue the face recognition system in a socially graceful way by turning slightly away and then toward a speaker when conditions for recognition are favorable.  1

Such system may be used in visual communication  applications, such as teleconferencing, virtual reality, intelligent interfaces, humanmachine  interaction, surveillance, etc. We have used a statistical skin-color model to  segment face-candidate regions in the image. The presence or absence of a face in  each region is verified by means of an eye detector, based on an efficient template  matching scheme . Once a face is detected, the pupils, nostrils and lip corners are  located and these facial features are tracked in the image sequence, performing real  time processing.  1

Report on the TREC-8 Experiment: Searching on the Web and in Distributed Collections this paper verifies whether or not hyperlinks improve retrieval effectiveness. In the second chapter, we describe experiments on the ad hoc track. In this case, we acknowledge that currently it is becoming more and more difficult to store and manage the growing document collections within a single computer. Recent advances in network technology do however allow us to disseminate information sources by partitioning a single huge corpus (or distributing heterogeneous collections) over a local-area network (Intranet). Most retrieval mechanisms currently proposed however are based on conventional IR models [Salton 89], and where a centralized document collection is assumed.

Reasoning with Examples: Propositional Formulae and Database Dependencies For humans, looking at how concrete examples behave is an intuitive way of deriving conclusions. The drawback with this method is that it does not necessarily give the correct results. However, under certain conditions example-based deduction can be used to obtain a correct and complete inference procedure. This is the case for Boolean formulae (reasoning with models) and for certain types of database integrity constraints (the use of Armstrong relations). We show that these approaches are closely related, and use the relationship to prove new results about the existence and sizes of Armstrong relations for Boolean dependencies. Furthermore, we exhibit close relations between the questions of finding keys in relational databases and that of finding abductive explanations. Further applications of the correspondence between these two approaches are also discussed. 1 Introduction  One of the major tasks in database systems as well as artificial intelligence systems is to express some know...

Task Assignment in Multiagent Systems based on Vickrey-type Auctioning and Leveled Commitment Contracting . A key problem addressed in the area of multiagent systems  is the automated assignment of multiple tasks to executing agents. The  automation of multiagent task assignment requires that the individual  agents (i) use a common protocol that prescribes how they have to interact  in order to come to an agreement and (ii) x their nal agreement  in a contract that species the commitments resulting from the assignment  on which they agreed. The work reported in this paper is part of a  broader research eort aiming at the design and analysis of approaches to  automated multiagent task assignment that combine auction protocols  and leveled commitment contracts. The primary advantage of such approaches  is that they are applicable in a broad range of realistic scenarios  in which knowledge-intensive negotiation among agents is not feasible  and in which unforeseeable future environmental changes may require  agents to breach their contracts.

Improved Algorithms for Optimal Winner Determination in Combinatorial Auctions and Generalizations Combinatorial auctions, i.e. auctions where bidders can bid on com-binations of items, tend to lead to more e cient allocations than tra-ditional auctions in multi-item auctions where the agents ' valuations of the items are not additive. However, determining the winners so as to maximize revenue is NP-complete. First, existing approaches for tackling this problem are reviewed: exhaustive enumeration, dynamic programming, approximation algorithms, and restricting the allow-able combinations. Then we present our search algorithm for optimal winner determination. Experiments are shown on several bid distri-butions. The algorithm allows combinatorial auctions to scale up to signi cantly larger numbers of items and bids than prior approaches to optimal winner determination by capitalizing on the fact that the space of bids is necessarily sparsely populated in practice. The algo-rithm does this by provably su cient selective generation of children in the search tree, by using a secondary search for fast child genera-tion, by heuristics that are accurate and optimized for speed, and by four methods for preprocessing the search space. Patent pending. A highly optimized implementation of the algorithm is available for licensing both for research and commercial purposes. Please contact the author. 1 1

Machine Learning in Automated Text Categorisation The automated categorisation (or classification) of texts into topical categories has a long history, dating back at least to the early ‚Äô60s. Until the late ‚Äô80s, the most effective approach to the problem seemed to be that of manually building automatic classifiers by means of knowledgeengineering techniques, i.e. manually defining a set of rules encoding expert knowledge on how to classify documents under a given set of categories. In the ‚Äô90s, with the booming production and availability of on-line documents, automated text categorisation has witnessed an increased and renewed interest, prompted by which the machine learning paradigm to automatic classifier construction has emerged and definitely superseded the knowledge-engineering approach. Within the machine learning paradigm, a general inductive process (called the learner) automatically builds a classifier (also called the rule, or the hypothesis) by ‚Äúlearning‚Äù, from a set of previously classified documents, the characteristics of one or more categories. The advantages of this approach are a very good effectiveness, a considerable savings in terms of expert manpower, and domain independence. In this survey we look at the main approaches that have been taken towards automatic text categorisation within the general machine learning paradigm. Issues pertaining to document indexing, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation, will be discussed in detail. A final section will be devoted to the techniques that have specifically been devised for an emerging application such as the automatic classification of Web pages into ‚ÄúYahoo!-like ‚Äù hierarchically structured sets of categories.

Optimal Camera Parameter Selection for State Estimation with Applications in Object Recognition In this paper we introduce a formalism for optimal camera parameter selection for iterative state estimation. We consider a framework based on Shannon 's information theory and select the camera parameters that maximize the mutual information, i.e. the information that the captured image conveys about the true state of the system. The technique explicitly takes into account the a priori probability governing the computation of the mutual information. Thus, a sequential decision process can be formed by treating the a posteriori probability at the current time step in the decision process as the a priori probability for the next time step. The convergence of the decision process can be proven.

Control and Datatypes using the View Formalism . We herein deal with mixed specification formalisms, i.e. formalisms with both a static (data types) and a dynamic (behaviour) part. Our formalism is based on symbolic transition systems (STS) [9], that allow one to specify systems at an abstract level and to avoid state explosion. STS are a kind of guarded finite state/transition diagrams where states and transitions are labelled with open terms. Both dynamic and static parts of objects are specified, in a unifying approach, as formal structures that we call views. These components interpretation structures use STS, and we show how these may be derived from their view structures. The system is structured by means of collections of objects (with identities) . A temporal logic is used to glue the components altogether and expresses a generalized form of synchronous product [1]. We then show how a view structure and its interpretation structure may be obtained. The formalism is explained using a simplified phone service example.  Keywor...

Power to the people: End-user building of digital library collections Naturally, digital library systems focus principally on the reader: the consumer of the material that constitutes the library. In contrast, this paper describes an interface that makes it easy for people to build their own library collections. Collections may be built and served locally from the user's own web server, or (given appropriate permissions) remotely on a shared digital library host. End users can easily build new collections styled after existing ones from material on the Web or from their local files---or both, and collections can be updated and new ones brought on-line at any time. The interface, which is intended for non-professional end users, is modeled after widely used commercial software installation packages. Lest one quail at the prospect of end users building their own collections on a shared system, we also describe an interface for the administrative user who is responsible for maintaining a digital library installation.

Relational Learning Techniques for Natural Language Information Extraction The recent growth of online information available in the form of natural language documents creates a greater need for computing systems with the ability to process those documents to simplify access to the information. One type of processing appropriate for many tasks is information extraction, a type of text skimming that retrieves specific types of information from text. Although information extraction systems have existed for two decades, these systems have generally been built by hand and contain domain specific information, making them difficult to port to other domains. A few researchers have begun to apply machine learning to information extraction tasks, but most of this work has involved applying learning to pieces of a much larger system. This paper presents a novel rule representation specific to natural language and a learning system, Rapier, which learns information extraction rules.

The Global Dimensionality of Face Space Low-dimensional representations of sensory signals are key to solving many of the computational problems encountered in high-level vision. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been used in the past to derive such compact representations for the object class of human faces. Here, with an interpretation of PCA as a probabilistic model, we employ two objective criteria to study its generalization properties in the context of large frontal-pose face databases. We find that the eigenfaces, the eigenspectrum, and the generalization depend strongly on the ensemble composition and size, with statistics for populations as large as 5500, still not stationary. Further, the assumption of mirror symmetry of the ensemble improves the quality of the results substantially in the low-statistics regime, and is also essential in the high-statistics regime. We employ a perceptual criterion and argue that, even with large statistics, the dimensionality of the PCA subspace necessary for adequate represent...

Hierarchical Memory-Based Reinforcement Learning A key challenge for reinforcement learning is scaling up to large  partially observable domains. In this paper, we show how a hierarchy  of behaviors can be used to create and select among variable  length short-term memories appropriate for a task. At higher levels  in the hierarchy, the agent abstracts over lower-level details  and looks back over a variable number of high-level decisions in  time. We formalize this idea in a framework called Hierarchical  Sux Memory (HSM). HSM uses a memory-based SMDP learning  method to rapidly propagate delayed reward across long decision  sequences. We describe a detailed experimental study comparing  memory vs. hierarchy using the HSM framework on a realistic  corridor navigation task.  1 Introduction  Reinforcement learning encompasses a class of machine learning problems in which an agent learns from experience as it interacts with its environment.

This is not only just a matter of fact, but really useful, because the cost of formalization is often not in the right relation to the potential benefits such that many informal parts of the scenario are economically reasonable [5].

Learning Network Designs for Asynchronous Teams . An asynchronous team (A-Team) is a network of agents (workers) and memories (repositories for the results of work). It is possible to design A-Teams to be effective in solving difficult computational problems. The main design issues are: "What structure should the network have?" and "What should be the complement of agents?" In the past, the structure-issue was resolved by intuition and experiment. This paper describes a procedure by which good structures can be learned from experience. The procedure is based on the use of regular expressions for encoding the capabilities of networks. 1 Introduction  An Asynchronous Team (A-Team) is a problem solving architecture consisting of collections of agents and memories connected into a strongly cyclic directed network.

Relational Transducers for Electronic Commerce Electronic commerce is emerging as one of the major Websupported applications requiring database support. We introduce and study high-level declarative specifications of business models, using an approach in the spirit of active databases. More precisely, business models are specified as  relational transducers that map sequences of input relations into sequences of output relations. The semantically meaningful trace of an input-output exchange is kept as a sequence of log relations. We consider problems motivated by electronic commerce applications, such as log validation, verifying temporal properties of transducers, and comparing two relational transducers. Positive results are obtained for a restricted class of relational transducers called Spocus transducers (for semi-positive outputs and cumulative state). We argue that despite the restrictions, these capture a wide range of practically significant business models.  1 Introduction  Electronic commerce is emerging as a major Web-s...

Graph Structured Views and Their Incremental Maintenance We study the problem of maintaining materialized views of graph structured data. The base data consists of records containing identifiers of other records. The data could represent traditional objects (with methods, attributes, and a class hierarchy), but it could also represent a lower level data structure. We define simple views and materialized views for such graph structured data, analyzing options for representing record identity and references in the view. We develop incremental maintenance algorithms for these views.  1 Introduction  Relational views are useful for controlling data access, specifying contents of caches (or remote copies), and other data management tasks. In this paper we study how to extend this view concept and the associated maintenance algorithms to what we call a graph structured database (GSDB).

Boosting for Document Routing RankBoost is a recently proposed algorithm for learning ranking functions. It is simple to implement and has strong justifications from computational learning theory. We describe the algorithm and present initial experimental results on applying it to the document routing problem. The first set of results applies RankBoost to a text representation produced using modern term weighting methods. Performance of RankBoost is somewhat inferior to that of a state-of-the-art routing algorithm which is, however, more complex and less theoretically justified than RankBoost. RankBoost achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art algorithm when combined with feature or example selection heuristics. Our second set of results examines the behavior of RankBoost when it has to learn not only a ranking function but also all aspects of term weighting from raw data. Performance is usually, though not always, less good here, but the term weighting functions implicit in the resulting ranking fun...

sView - Architecture Overview and System Description This report presents an architecture overview and a system description of the sView system. The system provides developers, service providers, and users of electronic services with an open and extendible service infrastructure that allows far-reaching user control. This is accomplished by collecting the services of an individual user in a virtual briefcase. Services come in the form of self-contained service components (i.e. including both logic and data), and the briefcase is mobile to allow it to follow as the user moves between different hosts and terminals. A specification of how to build such service components and the infrastructure for handling briefcases is presented. A reference implementation of the specification as well as extensions in the form of service components is also described. The purpose of the report is to serve as a technical reference for developers of sView services and software infrastructure that builds on sView technology. Keywords.

Toward Optimal Active Learning through Sampling Estimation of Error Reduction This paper presents an active learning method that directly  optimizes expected future error. This is in contrast  to many other popular techniques that instead  aim to reduce version space size. These other methods  are popular because for many learning models,  closed form calculation of the expected future error is  intractable. Our approach is made feasible by taking a  sampling approach to estimating the expected reduction  in error due to the labeling of a query. In experimental  results on two real-world data sets we reach  high accuracy very quickly, sometimes with four times  fewer labeled examples than competing methods.  1.

Semantics Of (disjunctive) Logic Programs Based On Partial Evaluation SEMANTICS AND TRANSFORMATIONS  In this paper, we consider allowed disjunctive DATALOG  :  programs over some fixed function-free finite signature \Sigma. In fact, in the semantical part of this paper, we consider only the ground instantiation of the programs, because we claim that any sensible semantics should assign the same meaning to a program P and its instantiation ground(P ). So the variables are seen only as a shorthand for denoting ground programs in a more compact way. This means that in the semantical part, we could as well have worked with propositional programs. However, in the computational part, it would be very inefficient to compute first the ground instantiation of the given program. Here we make use of the allowedness condition: every variable of the rule must occur also in a positive body literal. This guarantees that in every rule application, all variables are bound to a constant. It is  5 true that in this way we again manage to consider only ground programs. But...

Extensible and Similarity-based Grouping for Data Integration Data integration as required in a variety of applications like data warehousing, information system  integration etc. makes great demands regarding features to deal with overlapping and inconsistent  data. Object-relational and other data management systems available today provide only limited concepts  to deal with these requirements. The general concept of grouping and aggregation appears to  be a fitting paradigm for various of the current issues in data integration, but in its common form of  equality-based grouping a number of problems remain unsolved. Various extensions to this concept  have been introduced over the last years regarding user-defined functions for aggregation and grouping.

An Introduction to 3-D User Interface Design Three-dimensional user interface design is a critical component of any virtual environment (VE) application. In this paper, we present a broad overview of 3-D interaction and user interfaces. We discuss the effect of common VE hardware devices on user interaction, as well as interaction techniques for generic 3-D tasks and the use of traditional 2-D interaction styles in 3-D environments. We divide most userinteraction tasks into three categories: navigation, selection/manipulation, and system control. Throughout the paper, our focus is on presenting not only the available techniques but also practical guidelines for 3-D interaction design and widely held myths. Finally, we briefly discuss two approaches to 3-D interaction design and some example applications with complex 3-D interaction requirements. We also present an annotated online bibliography as a reference companion to this article.

Guiding User Navigation in Virtual Environments Using Awareness of Virtual Off-Screen Space Navigation in virtual environments can be difficult. One contributing factor is the problem of user disorientation. Two major causes of this are the lack of navigation cues in the environment and problems with navigating too close to or through virtual world objects. Previous work has developed guidelines, informed by cinematography conventions, for the construction of virtual environments to aid user comprehension of virtual "space" to reduce user disorientation. This paper describes the validation of these guidelines via a user study involving a navigation task in a virtual "maze". Results suggest that the use of the guidelines can help reduce the incidences of user disorientation. However, the guidelines seemed to have little impact on users' abilities to construct 'cognitive maps' of the environment.

On Computing Functions with Uncertainty We study the problem of computing a function f(x1;:::; xn) giv en that the actual values of the variables xi's are kno wn only with some uncertainty. F or each variable xi, aninterval Ii is kno wn such that the value of xi is guaranteed to fall within this interval. Any such interval can be probed to obtain the actual value of the underlying variable; how ever, there is a cost associated with each suc h probe. The goal is to adaptively iden tify a minimum cost sequence of probes suc h that regardless of the actual values tak en b y the unprobed xi's, the v alue of the functionf can be computed to within a speci ed precision. We design online algorithms for this problem when f is either the selection function or an aggregation function such as sum or average. We consider three natural models of precision and give algorithms for each model. We analyze our algorithms in the framework of competitive analysis and sho w that our algorithms are asymptotically optimal. Finally, we also study online algorithms for functions that are obtained by composing together selection and aggregation functions. 1.

A Semantics of Contrast and Information Structure for Specifying Intonation in Spoken Language Generation In this dissertation I present a model for the determination of intonation contours from context and provide two implemented systems which apply this theory to the problem of generating spoken language with appropriate intonation from high-level semantic representations. The theory and implementations presented here are based on an information structure framework that mediates between intonation and discourse, and encodes the proper level of semantic information to account for both contextually-bound accentuation patterns and intonational phrasing. The structural similarities among these linguistic levels of representation are the basis for selecting Combinatory Categorial Grammar #CCG, Steedman 1985,1990a# as the model for spoken language production. This model licenses congruent syntactic, prosodic and information structural constituents and consequently represents a simpli#cation over models of prosody developed in syntactically more traditional frameworks.

MetaCost: A General Method for Making Classifiers Cost-Sensitive Research in machine learning, statistics and related fields has produced a wide variety of algorithms for classification. However, most of these algorithms assume that all errors have the same cost, which is seldom the case in KDD prob- lems. Individually making each classification learner costsensitive is laborious, and often non-trivial. In this paper we propose a principled method for making an arbitrary classifier cost-sensitive by wrapping a cost-minimizing procedure around it. This procedure, called MetaCost, treats the underlying classifier as a black box, requiring no knowledge of its functioning or change to it. Unlike stratification, MetaCost is applicable to any number of classes and to arbitrary cost matrices. Empirical trials on a large suite of benchmark databases show that MetaCost almost always produces large cost reductions compared to the cost-blind classifier used (C4.5RULES) and to two forms of stratification. Further tests identify the key components of MetaCost and those that can be varied without substantial loss. Experiments on a larger database indicate that MetaCost scales well.

Digital Libraries and Autonomous Citation Indexing The World Wide Web is revolutionizing the way that researchers access scientific information. Articles are increasingly being made available on the homepages of authors or institutions, at journal Web sites, or in online archives. However, scientific information on the Web is largely disorganized. This article introduces the creation of digital libraries incorporating Autonomous Citation Indexing (ACI). ACI autonomously creates citation indices similar to the Science Citation Index R . An ACI system autonomously locates articles, extracts citations, identifies identical citations that occur in different formats, and identifies the context of citations in the body of articles. ACI can organize the literature and provide most of the advantages of traditional citation indices, such as literature search using citation links, and the evaluation of articles based on citation statistics. Furthermore, ACI can provide significant advantages over traditional citation indices. No manual effort is required for indexing, which should result in a reduction in cost and an increase in the availability of citation indices. An ACI system can also provide more comprehensive and up-to-date indices of the literature by indexing articles on the Web, technical reports, conference papers, etc. Furthermore, ACI makes it easy to browse the context of citations to given articles, allowing researchers to quickly and easily see what subsequent researchers have said about a given article. digital libraries incorporating ACI may significantly improve scientific dissemination and feedback.

Optimizing Global-Local Search Hybrids This paper develops a framework for optimizing global-local hybrids of search or optimization procedures. The paper starts by idealizing the search problem as a search by a global algorithm G for either (1) acceptable targets---solutions that meet a specified criterion---or for (2) basins of attraction that then lead to acceptable targets under a specified local search algorithm L. The paper continues by abstracting two sets of parameters, probabilities of successfully hitting targets and basins and time-to-criterion coefficients. With these parameters, equations may be written to account for the total time of search and for the probabilistic success (reliability) in reaching an acceptable solution. Thereafter, optimization problems are formulated in which the division of local versus global search time is optimized so that solution time to acceptable reliability is minimized or reliability under specified solution time is maximized. A two-basin optimality criterion is derived and appl...

Query Expansion Using an Interactive Concept Hierarchy Query expansion is the process of supplementing an original query with additional terms in order to refine a search and increase retrieval effectiveness. If the query expansion is interactive, then the user and the system work together to expand the query. The system usually suggests possible expansion terms and the user selects those they wish to add to the query. Studies have shown that interactive query expansion has the potential to improve retrieval effectiveness, but that it rarely succeeds in achieving its potential. It has been shown that users desire some control over the expansion process. In order to achieve this, the functionality of the system must be represented on the user interface in a comprehensible way. The main aim of this study is to focus on a small aspect of the interface and investigate whether the method used to present potential query expansion terms has any effect on retrieval effectiveness. The tool tested in this study automatically generates a hierarchical...

Comparing Top k Lists Motivated by several applications, we introduce various distance measures between ‚Äútop k lists.‚Äù Some of these distance measures are metrics, while others are not. For each of these latter distance measures, we show that they are ‚Äúalmost ‚Äù a metric in the following two seemingly unrelated aspects: (i) they satisfy a relaxed version of the polygonal (hence, triangle) inequality, and (ii) there is a metric with positive constant multiples that bound our measure above and below. This is not a coincidence‚Äîwe show that these two notions of almost being a metric are formally identical. Based on the second notion, we define two distance measures to be equivalent if they are bounded above and below by constant multiples of each other. We thereby identify a large and robust equivalence class of distance measures. Besides the applications to the task of identifying good notions of (dis-)similarity between two top k lists, our results imply polynomial-time constant-factor approximation algorithms for the rank aggregation problem [DKNS01] with respect to a large class of distance measures.

A Comparison Between Two Neural Network Rule Extraction Techniques for the Diagnosis of Hepatobiliary Disorders Neural networks have been widely used as tools for prediction in medicine.

These  rules are more comprehensible to a human user than the classification process of the  networks which involves complex nonlinear mapping of the input data. This paper  reports the results from two neural network rule extraction techniques, NeuroLinear  and NeuroRule applied to the diagnosis of hepatobiliary disorders.

Two Decades Of Statistical Language Modeling: Where Do We Go From Here? Statistical Language Models estimate the distribution of various natural language phenomena for the purpose of speech recognition and other language technologies. Since the first significant model was proposed in 1980, many attempts have been made to improve the state of the art. We review them here, point to a few promising directions, and argue for a Bayesian approach to integration of linguistic theories with data. 1. OUTLINE Statistical language modeling (SLM) is the attempt to capture regularities of natural language for the purpose of improving the performance of various natural language applications. By and large, statistical language modeling amounts to estimating the probability distribution of various linguistic units, such as words, sentences, and whole documents. Statistical language modeling is crucial for a large variety of language technology applications. These include speech recognition (where SLM got its start), machine translation, document classification and routing, optical character recognition, information retrieval, handwriting recognition, spelling correction, and many more. In machine translation, for example, purely statistical approaches have been introduced in [1]. But even researchers using rule-based approaches have found it beneficial to introduce some elements of SLM and statistical estimation [2]. In information retrieval, a language modeling approach was recently proposed by [3], and a statistical/information theoretical approach was developed by [4]. SLM employs statistical estimation techniques using language training data, that is, text. Because of the categorical nature of language, and the large vocabularies people naturally use, statistical techniques must estimate a large number of parameters, and consequently depend critically on the availability of large amounts of training data.

Steps Toward Accommodating Variable Position Tracking Accuracy in a Mobile Augmented Reality System The position-tracking accuracy of a location-aware mobile system can change dynamically as a function of the user's location and other variables specific to the tracker technology used. This is especially problematic for mobile augmented reality systems, which ideally require extremely precise position tracking for the user's head, but which may not always be able to achieve the necessary level of accuracy. While it is possible to ignore variable positional accuracy in an augmented reality user interface, this can make for a confusing system; for example, when accuracy is low, virtual objects that are nominally registered with real ones may be too far off to be of use.

Administering Permissions for Distributed Data: Factoring and Automated Inference We extend SQL's grant/revoke model to handle all administration of permissions in a distributed database. The key idea is to "factor" permissions into simpler decisions that can be administered separately, and for which we can devise sound inference rules. The model enables us to simplify administration via separation of concerns (between technical DBAs and domain experts), and to justify fully automated inference for some permission factors. We show how this approach would coexist with current practices based on SQL permissions. Keywords: Access permissions, derived data, view, federation, warehouse 1

Path Constraints on Semistructured and Structured Data We present a class of path constraints of interest in connection with both structured and semi-structured databases, and investigate their associated implication problems. These path constraints are capable of expressing natural integrity constraints that are not only a fundamental part of the semantics of the data, but are also important in query optimization. We show that in semistructured databases, despite the simple syntax of the constraints, their associated implication problem is r.e. complete and finite implication problem is co-r.e. complete. However, we establish the decidability of the implication problems for several fragments of the path constraint language, and demonstrate that these fragments suffice to express important semantic information such as inverse relationships and local database constraints commonly found in object-oriented databases. We also show that in the presence of types, the analysis of path constraint implication becomes more delicate. We demonstrate so...

Employing EM and Pool-Based Active Learning for Text Classification This paper shows how a text classifier's need for labeled training data can be reduced by a combination of active learning and Expectation Maximization (EM) on a pool of unlabeled data. Query-by-Committee is used to actively select documents for labeling, then EM with a naive Bayes model further improves classification accuracy by concurrently estimating probabilistic labels for the remaining unlabeled documents and using them to improve the model. We also present a metric for better measuring disagreement among committee members; it accounts for the strength of their disagreement and for the distribution of the documents. Experimental results show that our method of combining EM and active learning requires only half as many labeled training examples to achieve the same accuracy as either EM or active learning alone.

Querying Temporal Constraint Networks in PTIME We start with the assumption that temporal knowledge usually captured by constraint networks can be represented and queried more effectively by using the scheme of indefinite constraint databases proposed by Koubarakis. Although query evaluation in this scheme is in general a hard computational problem, we demonstrate that there are several interesting cases where query evaluation can be done in PTIME. These tractability results are original and subsume previous results by van Beek, Brusoni, Console and Terenziani. Introduction  When temporal constraint networks are used in applications, their nodes represent the times when certain facts are true, or when certain events take place, or when events start or end. By labeling nodes with appropriate natural language expressions (e.g., breakfast  or walk) and arcs by temporal relations, temporal constraint networks can be queried in useful ways. For example the query "Is it possible (or certain) that event walk happened after event breakfast...

Feasible Formation of Coalitions Among Autonomous Agents in Non-Super-Additive Environments Cooperating and sharing resources by creating coalitions of agents are an important way for autonomous agents to execute tasks and to maximize payoff. Such coalitions will form only if each member of a coalition gains more if it joins the coalition than it could gain otherwise. There are several ways of creating such coalitions and dividing the joint payoff among the members. In this paper we present algorithms for coalition formation and payoff distribution in non-super-additive environments. We focus on a low-complexity kernel-oriented coalition formation algorithm. The properties of this algorithm were examined via simulations. These have shown that the model increases the benefits of the agents within a reasonable time period, and more coalition formations provide more benefits to the agents.

A Classification Scheme for Negotiation in Electronic Commerce In the last few years we have witnessed a surge of business-to-consumer and business-to-business commerce operated on the Internet. However many of these systems are often nothing more than electronic catalogues on which the user can choose a product which is made available for a fixed price. This modus operandi is clearly failing to exploit the full potential of electronic commerce. Against this background, we argue here that in the next few years we will see a new generation of systems emerge, based on automatic negotiation. In this paper we identify the main parameters on which any automatic negotiation depends. This classification schema is then used to categorise the subsequent papers in this book that focus on automatic negotiation.

The paper concludes with discussion of future directions for research and applications inspired by using the prototype. 1. Introduction This scenario may sound some way off in practical terms, but it is not. All the technologies needed to support it are available. It is the aim of this paper to describe some of these technologies in more detail and give an indication of their current status. The paper will start by describing features available in wearable computers that are not available in current laptops or personal digital assistants (PDAs). It will then go on to describe a number of other general application areas for wearables and current wearable technologies and design needs.

Kea identifies candidate keyphrases using lexical methods, calculates feature values for each candidate, and uses a machine -learning algorithm to predict which candidates are good keyphrases. The machine learning scheme first builds a prediction model using training documents with known keyphrases, and then uses the model to find keyphrases in new documents.

Combining the Self-Organizing Map and K-Means Clustering for On-line Classification of Sensor Data Many devices, like mobile phones, use contextual profiles like "in the car" or "in a meeting" to quickly switch between behaviors. Achieving automatic context detection, usually by analysis of small hardware sensors, is a fundamental problem in human-computer interaction. However, mapping the sensor data to a context is a difficult problem involving near real-time classification and training of patterns out of noisy sensor signals. This paper proposes an adaptive approach that uses a Kohonen Self-Organizing Map, augmented with on-line k-means clustering for classification of the incoming sensor data. Overwriting of prototypes on the map, especially during the untangling phase of the Self-Organizing Map, is avoided by a refined k-means clustering of labeled input vectors.

CAST: Collaborative Agents for Simulating Teamwork Psychological studies on teamwork have shown that an effective team often can anticipate information needs of teammates based on a shared mental model. Existing multi-agent models for teamwork are limited in their ability to support proactive information exchange among teammates. To address this issue, we have developed and implemented a multi-agent architecture called CAST that simulates teamwork and supports proactive information exchange in a dynamic environment. We present a formal model for proactive information exchange. Knowledge regarding the structure and process of a team is described in a language called MALLET. Beliefs about shared team processes and their states are represented using Petri Nets. Based on this model, CAST agents offer information proactively to those who might need it using an algorithm called DIARG. Empirical evaluations using a multi-agent synthetic testbed application indicate that CAST enhances the effectiveness of teamwork among agents without sacrificing a high cost for communications. 1

Approximate Nearest Neighbor Searching in Multimedia Databases In this paper, we develop a general framework for approximate nearest neighbor queries. We categorize the current approaches for nearest neighbor query processing based on either their ability to reduce the data set that needs to be examined, or their ability to reduce the representation size of each data object. We first propose modifications to wellknown techniques to support the progressive processing of approximate nearest neighbor queries. A user may therefore stop the retrieval process once enough information has been returned. We then develop a new technique based on clustering that merges the benefits of the two general classes of approaches. Our cluster-based approach allows a user to progressively explore the approximate results with increasing accuracy. We propose a new metric for evaluation of approximate nearest neighbor searching techniques. Using both the proposed and the traditional metrics, we analyze and compare several techniques with a detailed performance evaluation. We demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of approximate nearest neighbor searching. We perform experiments on several real data sets and establish the superiority of the proposed cluster-based technique over the existing techniques for approximate nearest neighbor searching. 1

Model Checking Multiagent Systems Model checking is a very successful technique which has been applied in the design and verification of finite state concurrent reactive processes. In this paper we show how this technique can be lifted to be applicable to multiagent systems.

We show how communication performatives from existing agent communication languages as well as their preconditions and eects can be expressed within logic-based agents in terms of the agents' beliefs. We illustrate the resulting language for programming logic-based agents by means of examples. 1 Introduction  In an earlier paper [6], we propose an approach to logic-based agents by combining the approach to agents by Kowalski and Sadri [11] and the approach to meta-reasoning by Costantini et al.

The Open Agent Architecture: A Framework for Building Distributed Software Systems The Open Agent Architecture (OAA), developed and used for several years at SRI International, makes it possible for software services to be provided through the cooperative efforts of distributed collections of autonomous agents. Communication and cooperation between agents are brokered by one or more facilitators, which are responsible for matching requests, from users and agents, with descriptions of the capabilities of other agents. Thus, it is not generally required that a user or agent know the identities, locations, or number of other agents involved in satisfying a request. OAA is structured so as to minimize the effort involved in creating new agents and "wrapping" legacy applications, written in various languages and operating on various platforms; to encourage the reuse of existing agents; and to allow for dynamism and flexibility in the makeup of agent communities. Distinguishing features of OAA as compared with related work include extreme flexibility in using facilitator-b...

Configuration methodologies based on a single mobile agent acting serially and multiple mobile agents acting in parallel are compared in terms of time duration and network load. The use of a small expert system to provide the intelligence needed to handle error situations is investigated. A test environment composed of three simulated ATM switch nodes is develop...

Building Efficient Wireless Sensor Networks with Low-Level Naming In most distributed systems, naming of nodes for low-level communication leverages topological location (such as node addresses)  and is independent of any application. In this paper, we investigate an emerging class of distributed systems where low-level communication does not rely on network topological location. Rather, low-level communication is based on attributes that are external to the network topology and relevant to the application. When combined with dense deployment of nodes, this kind of named data enables in-network processing for data aggregation, collaborative signal processing, and similar problems. These approaches are essential for emerging applications such as sensor networks where resources such as bandwidth and energy are limited. This paper is the first description of the software architecture that supports  named data and in-network processing in an operational, multi-application sensor-network. We show that approaches such as in-network aggregation and nested queries can significantly affect network traffic. In one experiment aggregation reduces traffic by up to 42% and nested queries reduce loss rates by 30%. Although aggregation has been previously studied in simulation, this paper demonstrates nested queries as another form of in-network processing, and it presents the first evaluation of these approaches over an operational testbed.

Learning from History for Behavior-Based Mobile Robots in Non-Stationary Conditions . Learning in the mobile robot domain is a very challenging task, especially in nonstationary conditions. The behavior-based approach has proven to be useful in making mobile robots work in real-world situations. Since the behaviors are responsible for managing the interactions between the robots and its environment, observing their use can be exploited to model these interactions. In our approach, the robot is initially given a set of "behavior-producing" modules to choose from, and the algorithm provides a memory-based approach to dynamically adapt the selection of these behaviors according to the history of their use. The approach is validated using a vision- and sonar-based Pioneer I robot in non-stationary conditions, in the context of a multirobot foraging task. Results show the effectiveness of the approach in taking advantage of any regularities experienced in the world, leading to fast and adaptable specialization for the learning robot.

Bringing Information Extraction out of the Labs: the Pinocchio Environment . Pinocchio is an environment for developing Information Extraction applications. New applications and languages can be covered by just writing declarative resources. Information is represented uniformly throughout the architecture: all the modules use the same input structure and the same type of declarative resources. Modules are implemented via the same basic processors and share a common environment for resource development and debugging. The result is an environment easy to use with limited training and skills.  1 INTRODUCTION  The exponential increase in the quantity of information held in digital archives has fueled growing interest in techniques for Information Extraction. Given that the vast majority of available information is textual (e.g., web pages, electronic newspapers, agency news), the role of Information Extraction from text (IE) is becoming more and more central. An IE system extracts pieces of information that are salient to the user's needs. The typical output is a...

The Persistent Cache: Improving OID Indexing in Temporal Object-Oriented Database Systems In a temporal OODB, an OID index (OIDX) is needed to map from OID to the physical location of the object. In a transaction time temporal OODB, the OIDX should also index the object versions. In this case, the index entries, which we call object descriptors (OD), also include the commit timestamp of the transaction that created the object version. The OIDX in a non-temporal OODB only needs to be updated when an object is created, but in a temporal OODB, the OIDX have to be updated every time an object is updated. We have in a previous study shown that this can be a potential bottleneck, and in this report, we present the Persistent Cache (PCache), a novel approach which reduces the index update and lookup costs in temporal OODBs. In this report, we develop a cost model for the PCache, and use this to show that the use of a PCache can reduce the average access cost to only a fraction of the cost when not using the PCache. Even though the primary context of this report is OID indexing in ...

Abduction with Negation as Failure for Active Databases and Agents Recent work has suggested abductive logic programming as a suitable formalism to represent active databases and intelligent agents. In particular, abducibles and integrity constaints in abductive logic programs can be used respectively to represent actions and active/reactive rules. One would expect that, in this approach, abductive proof procedures could provide the engine underlying active database management systems and agents. We analyse existing abductive proof procedures and argue that they are inadequate in handling these applications. The inadequacy is due to the "incorrect" treatment of negative literals in integrity constraints. We propose a new abductive proof procedure and give examples of how this proof procedure can be used to achieve active behaviour in (deductive) databases and proactivity and reactivity in agents.

Eliminators and Classifiers Classification may not be reliable for several reasons: noise in the data, insufficient input information, overlapping distributions and sharp definition of classes. Faced with K possibilities a decision support system may still be useful in such cases if instead of classification elimination of improbable classes is done. Eliminators may be constructed using classifiers assigning new cases to a pool of several classes instead of just one winning class. Elimination may be done with the help of several classifiers using modified error functions. A real life medical example is presented illustrating the usefulness of elimination.

Identifying the Subject of Documents in Digital Libraries Automatically Using Contemporary information databases contain millions of electronic documents. The immense number of documents makes it difficult to conduct efficient searches on the Internet. Several studies have found that associating documents with a subject or list of topics can make them easier to locate online [5] [6] [7]. Effective cataloging of information is performed manually, requiring extensive resources. Consequently, at present most information is not cataloged. This paper will present the findings of a study based on a software tool (TextAnalysis) that automatically identifies the subject of a document. We tested documents in two subject categories: geography and family studies. The present study follows an earlier one that examined the subject categories of industrial management and general management.

Achieving Robust Human-Computer Communication This paper describes a computational approach to robust human-computer interaction. The approach relies on an explicit, declarative representation of the content and structure of the interaction that a computer system builds over the course of the interaction. In this paper, we will show how this representation allows the system to recognize and repair misunderstandings between the human and the computer. We demonstrate the utility of the representations by showing how they facilitate the repair process.  1 Introduction  In dialogs between people or between people and machines, understanding is an uncertain process.

The CMUnited-97 Small Robot Team Abstract. Robotic soccer is a challenging research domain which involves multiple agents that need to collaborate in an adversarial environment toachieve speci c objectives. In this paper, we describe CMUnited, the team of small robotic agents that we developed to enter the RoboCup-97 competition. We designed and built the robotic agents, devised the appropriate vision algorithm, and developed and implemented algorithms for strategic collaboration between the robots in an uncertain and dynamic environment. The robots can organize themselves in formations, hold speci c roles, and pursue their goals. In game situations, they have demonstrated their collaborative behaviors on multiple occasions. The robots can also switch roles to maximize the overall performance of the team. We present anoverview of the vision processing algorithm which successfully tracks multiple moving objects and predicts trajectories. The paper then focusses on the agent behaviors ranging from low-level individual behaviors to coordinated, strategic team behaviors. CMUnited won the RoboCup-97 small-robot competition at IJCAI-97 in Nagoya, Japan. 1

Ramification Analysis Using Causal Mapping To operate in the real-world, intelligent agents constantly need to absorb new information, and to consider the ramifications of it. This raises interesting questions for knowledge representation and reasoning. Here we consider ramification analysis in which we wish to determine both the likely outcomes from events occuring and the less likely, but very significant outcomes, from events occuring. To formalize ramification analysis, we introduce the notion of causal maps for modelling "causal relationships" between events. In particular, we consider existential event classes, for example presidential-election, with instances being true, false,  or unknown, and directional events classes, for example inflation, with instances being increasing, decreasing or unchanging. Using causal maps, we can propagate new information to determine possible ramifications. These ramifications are also described in terms of events. Whilst causal maps offer a lucid view on ramifications, we also want to su...

DAB: Interactive Haptic Painting with 3D Virtual Brushes We present a novel painting system with an intuitive haptic interface, which serves as an expressive vehicle for interactively creating painterly works. We introduce a deformable, 3D brush model, which gives the user natural control of complex brush strokes. The force feedback enhances the sense of realism and provides tactile cues that enable the user to better manipulate the paint brush. We have also developed a bidirectional, two-layer paint model that, combined with a palette interface, enables easy loading of complex blends onto our 3D virtual brushes to generate interesting paint effects on the canvas. The resulting system, DAB, provides the user with an artistic setting, which is conceptually equivalent to a real-world painting environment. Several users have tested DAB and were able to start creating original art work within minutes.

Context Awareness and Mobile Phones : This paper investigates some aspects of how context-awareness can support users of mobile phones, in particular the calling party. The use of mobile and stationary phones is discussed in relation to situational properties of a phone conversation, especially with regards to who might benefit from context-awareness in this context. An initial hypothesis is that mobile phone users communicate context information to each other (verbally) to a much higher degree than do stationary phone users. Mobile phone users could benefit much from context awareness technology, in particular when about to make a call, if they can receive context information regarding the person they are trying to reach prior to establishing the call. We argue that such technology should require low amounts of explicit user interaction, and could lead to less disrupting calls in inappropriate moments, as well as less frustration for the calling party when a call is not answered.

Incremental Maintenance of Materialized OQL Views The importance of materialized views has grown significantly with the advent of data warehousing and OLAP technology. This increases the relevance of solutions to the problem of incrementally maintaining materialized views. So far, most work on this problem has been confined to relational settings. Proposals that apply to object databases have either used non-standard models or fallen short of providing a comprehensive framework. This paper contributes a solution to the incremental view maintenance problem for a large class of views expressed in OQL, the query language of the ODMG standard for object databases. The solution applies to immediate update propagation, and works for any update operation on views de ned over a substantial subset of ODMG types. The approach presented has been fully implemented and preliminary performance results are reported.

Why Unary and Binary Operations in Logic: General Result Motivated by Interval-Valued Logics Traditionally, in logic, only unary and binary operations are used as basic ones -- e.g., "not", "and", "or" -- while the only ternary (and higher order) operations are the operations which come from a combination of unary and binary ones. For the classical logic, with the binary set of truth values f0; 1g, the possibility to express an arbitrary operation in terms of unary and binary ones is well known: it follows, e.g., from the well known possibility to express an arbitrary operation in DNF form. A similar representation result for [0; 1]-based logic was proven in our previous paper. In this paper, we expand this result to finite logics (more general than classical logic) and to multi-D analogues of the fuzzy logic -- both motivated by interval-valued fuzzy logics.  1.

Revisiting Structured Storage: A Transactional Record Store An increasing number of applications, such as electronic mail servers, web servers, and personal information managers, handle large amounts of homogeneous data. This data can be effectively represented as records and manipulated through simple operations, e.g., record reading, writing, and searching. Unfortunately, modern storage systems are inappropriate for the needs of these applications. On one side, file systems store only unstructured data (byte strings) with very limited reliability guarantees. On the other side, relational databases store structured data and provide both concurrency control and transactions; but relational databases are often too slow, complex, and difficult to manage for many applications. This paper presents a transactional record store that directly addresses the needs of modern applications. The store combines the simplicity and manageability of the file system interface with a select few features for managing record-oriented data. We describe the principles guiding the design of our transactional record store as well as its design. We also present a prototype implementation and its performance evaluation. 1

Generating Extraction-Based Summaries from Hand-Written Summaries by Aligning Text Spans Human-quality text summarization systems based on sentence extraction are difficult to design because documents can differ along several dimensions, such as length, writing style and lexical usage. The lack of suitable corpora of extraction-based summaries makes it difficult to evaluate and improve existing algorithms. However, there are a large number of hand-written (not extraction-based) summaries available for news-wire stories. This paper discusses our work on generating a corpus of approximately 25,000 extractionbased summaries from hand-written summaries. We discuss how text-span alignment can be applied to this problem and how this problem differs from previous work on aligning parallel texts. In addition, we briefly analyze differences between handwritten and extracted summaries. 1 Introduction  Human-quality text summarization systems based on sentence extraction are difficult to design, and even more difficult to evaluate, because documents can differ along several dimension...

Estimating the Usefulness of Search Engines In this paper, we present a statistical method to estimate the usefulness of a search engine for any given query. The estimates can be used by a metasearch engine to choose local search engines to invoke. For a given query, the usefulness of a search engine in this paper is defined to be a combination of the number of documents in the search engine that are sufficiently similar to the query and the average similarity of these documents. Experimental results indicate that the proposed estimation method is quite accurate. 1 Introduction  Many search engines have been created on the Internet to help ordinary users find desired data. Each search engine has a corresponding database that defines the set of documents that can be searched by the search engine.

A Framework for Ontology Integration One of the basic problems in the development of techniques for the semantic  web is the integration of ontologies. Indeed, the web is constituted by a variety of  information sources, each expressed over a certain ontology, and in order to extract  information from such sources, their semantic integration and reconciliation in terms  of a global ontology is required. In this paper, we address the fundamental problem  of how to specify the mapping between the global ontology and the local ontologies.  We argue that for capturing such mapping in an appropriate way, the notion of query  is a crucial one, since it is very likely that a concept in one ontology corresponds  to a view (i.e., a query) over the other ontologies. As a result query processing in  ontology integration systems is strongly related to view-based query answering in data  integration.  1

Linkage Learning via Probabilistic Modeling in the ECGA The goal of linkage learning, or building block identification, is the creation of a more effective genetic algorithm (GA). This paper explores the relationship between the linkage-learning problem and that of learning probability distributions over multi-variate spaces. Herein, it is argued that these problems are equivalent. Using a simple but effective approach to learning distributions, and by implication linkage, this paper reveals the existence of GA-like algorithms that are potentially orders of magnitude faster and more accurate than the simple GA. I. Introduction Linkage learning in genetic algorithms (GAs) is the identification of building blocks to be conserved under crossover. Theoretical studies have shown that if an effective linkage-learning GA were developed, it would hold significant advantages over the simple GA (2).

The Amulet Environment: New Models for Effective User Interface Software Development Abstract‚ÄîThe Amulet user interface development environment makes it easier for programmers to create highly-interactive, graphical user interface software for Unix, Windows and the Macintosh. Amulet uses new models for objects, constraints, animation, input, output, commands, and undo. The object system is a prototype-instance model in which there is no distinction between classes and instances or between methods and data. The constraint system allows any value of any object to be computed by arbitrary code and supports multiple constraint solvers. Animations can be attached to existing objects with a single line of code. Input from the user is handled by ‚Äúinteractor ‚Äù objects which support reuse of behavior objects. The output model provides a declarative definition of the graphics and supports automatic refresh. Command objects encapsulate all of the information needed about operations, including support for various ways to undo them. A key feature of the Amulet design is that all graphical objects and behaviors of those objects are explicitly represented at run-time, so the system can provide a number of high-level built-in functions, including automatic display and editing of objects, and external analysis and control of interfaces. Amulet integrates these capabilities in a flexible and effective manner.

XML with Data Values: Typechecking Revisited We investigate the typechecking problem for XML queries: statically verifying that every answer to a query conforms to a given output DTD, for inputs satisfying a given input DTD. This problem had been studied by a subset of the authors in a simplified framework that captured the structure of XML documents but ignored data values. We revisit here the typechecking problem in the more realistic case when data values are present in documents and tested by queries. In this extended framework, typechecking quickly becomes undecidable. However, it remains decidable for large classes of queries and DTDs of practical interest. The main contribution of the present paper is to trace a fairly tight boundary of decidability for typechecking with data values. The complexity of typechecking in the decidable cases is also considered.  1.

Learning to Extract Keyphrases from Text Many academic journals ask their authors to provide a list of about five to fifteen key words, to appear on the first page of each article. Since these key words are often phrases of two or more words, we prefer to call them keyphrases. There is a surprisingly wide variety of tasks for which keyphrases are useful, as we discuss in this paper. Recent commercial software, such  as Microsoft's Word 97 and Verity's Search 97, includes algorithms that automatically extract keyphrases from documents. In this paper, we approach the problem of automatically extracting keyphrases from text as a supervised learning task. We treat a document as a set of phrases, which the learning algorithm must learn to classify as positive or negative examples of keyphrases.

StorHouse/Relational Manager (RM) - Active Storage Hierarchy Database System and Applications This paper describes how database systems can use and exploit a cost-effective active storage hierarchy. By active storage hierarchy we mean a database system that uses all storage media (i.e. optical, tape, and disk) to store and retrieve data and not just disk. We describe and emphasize the active part, whereby all storage types are used to store raw data that is converted to strategic business information. We describe an evolution to the Data Warehouse concept, called Atomic Data Store, whereby atomic data is stored in the database system. Atomic data is defined as storing all the historic data values and executing queries against the historic queries. We also describe a Data Warehouse information collection, flow and central data store Hub-and-Spoke architecture, used to feed data into Data Marts. We also describe a commercial product; StorHouse/Relational Manager (RM). RM is a commercial relational database system that executes SQL queries directly against data stored on the storage hierarchy (i.e. tape, optical, disk). We conclude with a brief overview of a real world AT&T Call Detail Warehouse (CDW) case study.

Spatially aware local communication in the RAUM system In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for local communication between devices in Ubiquitous Computing environments, assuming a multitude of computerized everyday appliances communicating with each other to solve tasks. This paradigm is based on the concept that the location of devices is central for the communication in such a scenario. Devices define their communication scope by spatial criteria. In our paradigm no explicit addressing or identification of communication partners is used. In comparison to traditional communication methods the approach eases routing and discovery problems and can be deployed in a highly dynamic environment without centralized services. We use the term local communication as inter-device communication in a physically restricted local area. This is well distinguish from the terms telecommunication as communication over distance where location information is explicitly hidden.

Affine Object Representations for Calibration-Free Augmented Reality We describe the design and implementation of a videobased augmented reality system capable of overlaying threedimensional graphical objects on live video of dynamic environments. The key feature of the system is that it is completely uncalibrated: it does not use any metric information about the calibration parameters of the camera or the 3D locations and dimensions of the environment‚Äôs objects. The only requirement is the ability to track across frames at least four feature points that are specified by the user at system initialization time and whose world coordinates are unknown. Our approach is based on the following observation: Given a set of four or more non-coplanar 3D points, the projection of all points in the set can be computed as a linear combination of the projections of just four of the points. We exploit this observation by (1) tracking lines and fiducial points at frame rate, and (2) representing virtual objects in a non-Euclidean, affine frame of reference that allows their projection to be computed as a linear combination of the projection of the fiducial points. 1.

Point- Versus Interval-based Temporal Data Models The association of timestamps with various data items such as tuples or attribute values is fundamental to the management of time-varying information. Using intervals in timestamps, as do most data models, leaves a data model with a variety of choices for giving a meaning to timestamps. Specifically, some such data models claim to be point-based while other data models claim to be interval-based. The meaning chosen for timestamps is important---it has a pervasive effect on most aspects of a data model, including database design, a variety of query language properties, and query processing techniques, e.g., the availability of query optimization opportunities. This paper precisely defines the notions of point-based and interval-based temporal data models, thus providing a new, formal basis for characterizing temporal data models and obtaining new insights into the properties of their query languages.

The Genetic Algorithm as a Discovery Engine: Strange Circuits and New Principles This paper examines the idea of a genetic or evolutionary algorithm being an inspirational or discovery engine. This is illustrated in the particular context of designing electronic circuits. We argue that by connecting pieces of logic together and testing them to see if they carry out the desired function it may be possible to discover new principles of design, and new algebraic techniques. This is illustrated in the design of binary circuits, particularly arithmetic functions, where we demonstrate that by evolving a hierarchical series of examples, it becomes possible to re-discover the well known ripple-carry principle for building adder circuits of any size. We also examine the much harder case of multiplication. We show also that extending the work into the field of multiple-valued logic, the genetic algorithm is able to produce fully working circuits that lie outside conventional algebra. In addition we look at the issue of principle extraction from evolved data.  1 Introduction ...

Mindless Visualisations The wonder and, unfortunately, to the detriment of visualisation for the representation and  comprehension of complex data sets is that to be most successful requires that they are tailored to suit  the task and underlying data. Such a restriction enables visualisations to be well designed for the tasks  to which they are known to be applied to, and also to accommodate the style and range of data to be  expected as normal. The problem with this repeated redesign of visualisations is that the interface is  often neglected, and can even be solely dependent on the implementing technology used for the  visualisation. It is important to add such issues as the interface to visualisation considerations, and to  provide reusable concepts that will integrate with a range of metaphors and displays. This position  paper examines the issues surrounding such visualisation interfaces and presents a discussion of those  issues.  1.

During the last years the increasing amount of information accessible through the Web has presented new challenges to academic and industrial research on database. In this context, data are either structured, when coming from relational or object-oriented databases, or partially or completely unstructured, when they consist of simple collections of text or image files. In the context of semistructured data, model and query languages must be extended in order to consider dynamic aspects. We present a model based on labeled graphs for representing changes in semistructured data and a SQL-like query language for querying it.

Scalable Algorithms for Large Temporal Aggregation The ability to model time-varying natures is essential to many database applications such as data warehousing and mining. However, the temporal aspects provide many unique characteristics and challenges for query processing and optimization. Among the challenges is computing temporal aggregates, which is complicated by having to compute temporal grouping. In this paper, we introduce a variety of temporal aggregation algorithms that overcome major drawbacks of previous work. First, for small-scale aggregations, both the worst-case and average-case processing time have been improved significantly. Second, for large-scale aggregations, the proposed algorithms can deal with a database that is substantially larger than the size of available memory.

Intention Reconsideration Reconsidered Abstract. In this paper, we consider the issue of designing agents that successfully balance the amount of time spent in reconsidering their intentions against the amount of time spent acting to achieve them. Following a brief review of the various ways in which this problem has previously been analysed, we motivate and introduce a simple formal model of agents, which is closely related to the well-known belief-desire-intention model. In this model, an agent is explicitly equipped with mechanisms for deliberation and action selection, as well as a meta-level control function, which allows the agent to choose between deliberation and action. Using the formal model, we define what it means for an agent to be optimal with respect to a task environment, and explore how various properties of an agent‚Äôs task environment can impose certain requirements on its deliberation and meta-level control components. We then show how the model can capture a number of interesting practical reasoning scenarios, and illustrate how our notion of meta-level control can easily be extended to encompass higherorder meta-level reasoning. We conclude with a discussion and pointers to future work. 1

What can Knowledge Representation do for Semi-Structured Data? The problem of modeling semi-structured data is important in many application areas such as multimedia data management, biological databases, digital libraries, and data integration. Graph schemas (Buneman et al. 1997) have been proposed recently as a simple and elegant formalism for representing semistructured data. In this model, schemas are represented as graphs whose edges are labeled with unary formulae of a theory, and the notions of conformance of a database to a schema and of subsumption between two schemas are defined in terms of a simulation relation. Several authors have stressed the need of extending graph schemas with various types of constraints, such as edge existence and constraints on the number of outgoing edges. In this paper we analyze the appropriateness of various knowledge representation formalisms for representing and reasoning about graph schemas extended with constraints. We argue that neither First Order Logic, nor Logic Programming nor Frame-based languages ...

Moral Sentiments in Multi-Agent Systems We present a simulation of a society of agents where some  of them have "moral sentiments" towards the agents that belong to the  same social group, using the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma as a metaphor  for the social interactions. Besides the well-understood phenomenon of  short-sighted, self-interested agents performing well in the short-term  but ruining their chances of such performance in the long run in a world  of reciprocators, the results suggest that, where some agents are more  generous than that, these agents have a positive impact on the social  group to which they belong, without compromising too much their individual  performance (i.e., the group performance improves). The inspiration  for this project comes from a discussion on Moral Sentiments by  M.Ridley. We describe various simulations where conditions and parameters  over determined dimensions were arranged to account for different  types and compositions of societies. Further, we indicate several lessons  that arise from the analysis of the results and comparison of the different  experiments. We also relate this work to our previous anthropological  approach to the adaptation of migrant agents, and argue that allowing  agents to possess suitably-chosen emotions can have a decisive impact on  Multi-Agent Systems. This implies that some common notions of agent  autonomy (and related concepts) should be reexamined.

Using Process Algebras to Formally Specify Mobile Agent Data Integrity Properties: a Case Study This paper shows how cryptographic protocols for mobile agent data integrity properties can be formally specified by using spi calculus, an extension of # calculus with cryptographic properties. In particular, by means of a case study, it is shown how a specification technique initially conceived only for classical cryptographic protocols can be used in the context of mobile agents as well. Our case study includes the spi calculus specification of a sample mobile agent data integrity protocol and of its security property.

Interactive Maps for a Digital Video Library The Informedia Digital Video Library contains over 1200 hours of video. Through automatic processing, descriptors are derived for the video to improve library access. A new extension to the video processing is the extraction of geographic references from these descriptors. The operational library interface shows the geographic entities addressed in a given story, highlighting the regions discussed at any point in the video through a map display synchronized with the video playback. The map can also be used as a query mechanism, allowing users to search the terabyte library for stories taking place in a selected area of interest.  1. Introduction  The Informedia Project at Carnegie Mellon University investigates the utility of speech recognition, image processing, and natural language processing techniques for improving search and discovery in the video medium.

Incremental Maintenance for Materialized Views over Semistructured Data Semistructured data is not strictly typed like relational or object-oriented data and may be irregular or incomplete. It often arises in practice, e.g., when heterogeneous data sources are integrated or data is taken from the World Wide Web. Views over semistructured data can be used to filter the data and to restructure (or provide structure to) it. To achieve fast query response time, these views are often materialized. This paper studies incremental maintenance techniques for materialized views over semistructured data. We use the graph-based data model OEM and the query language Lorel, developed at Stanford, as the framework for our work. We propose a new algorithm that produces a set of queries that compute the changes to the view based upon a change to the source. We develop an analytic cost model and compare the cost of executing our incremental maintenance algorithm to that of recomputing the view. We show that for nearly all types of database updates, it is more efficient to a...

Planning in Interplanetary Space: Theory and Practice On May 17th 1999, NASA activated for the first time  an AI-based planner/scheduler running on the flight  processor of a spacecraft. This was part of the Remote  Agent Experiment (RAX), a demonstration of closedloop  planning and execution, and model-based state inference  and failure recovery. This paper describes the  RAX Planner/Scheduler (RAX-PS), both in terms of  the underlying planning framework and in terms of the  fielded planner. RAX-PS plans are networks of constraints,  built incrementally by consulting a model of  the dynamics of the spacecraft. The RAX-PS planning  procedure is formally well defined and can be  proved to be complete. RAX-PS generates plans that  are temporally flexible, allowing the execution system  to adjust to actual plan execution conditions without  breaking the plan. The practical aspect, developing a  mission critical application, required paying attention  to important engineering issues such as the design of  methods for programmable search contr...

From Binary Temporal Relations to Non-Binary Ones and Back In this paper a new approach towards temporal reasoning is presented that scales up from the temporal relations commonly used in Allen's qualitative interval calculus and in quantitative temporal constraint satisfaction problems to include interval relations with distances, temporal rules and other non-binary relations into the reasoning scheme. For this purpose, we generalize well-known methods for constraint propagation, determination of consistency and computation of the minimal network from simpler schemes that only allow for binary relations. Thereby, we nd that levels of granularity play a major role for applying these techniques in our more expressive framework. Indeed, the technical preliminaries we provide are especially apt to investigate the switching between dierent granularities of representation, hence illucitating and exploiting the tradeo between expressiveness and eciency of temporal reasoning schemes on the one side and between expressiveness and understandability ...

Answering Queries by Semantic Caches There has been growing interest in semantic query caches to  aid in query evaluation. Semantic caches are simply the results of previously  asked queries, or selected relational information chosen by an evaluation  strategy, that have been cached locally. For complex environments  such as distributed, heterogeneous databases and data warehousing, the  use of semantic caches promises to help optimize query evaluation, increase  turnaround for users, and reduce network load and other resource  usage. We present a general logical framework for semantic caches. We  consider the use of all relational operations across the caches for answering  queries, and we consider the various ways to answer, and to partially  answer, a query by cache. We address when answers are in cache, when  answers in cache can be recovered, and the notions of semantic overlaps,  semantic independence, and semantic query remainder.  While there has been much work relevant to the use of semantic caches,  no one has addressed in conjunction the issues pertinent to the effective  use of semantic caches to evaluate queries. In some cases, this is due to  overly simplified assumptions, and in other cases to the lack of a formal  framework. We attempt to establish some of that framework here. Within  that framework, we illustrate the issues involved in using semantic caches  for query evaluation. We show various applications for semantic caches,  and relate the work to relevant areas.  1

Phidgets: Easy Development of Physical Interfaces through Physical Widgets Physical widgets or phidgets are to physical user interfaces what widgets are to graphical user interfaces. Similar to widgets, phidgets abstract and package input and output devices: they hide implementation and construction details, they expose functionality through a well-defined API, and they have an (optional) on-screen interactive interface for displaying and controlling device state. Unlike widgets, phidgets also require: a connection manager to track how devices appear on-line; a way to link a software phidget with its physical counterpart; and a simulation mode to allow the programmer to develop, debug and test a physical interface even when no physical device is present. Our evaluation shows that everyday programmers using phidgets can rapidly develop physical interfaces.

Using LDAP Directory Caches this paper, we consider the problem of reusing cached LDAP directory entries for answering (declarative) LDAP queries. We develop a suite of query transformations that capture the semantics of LDAP queries, and design a sound and complete algorithm for determining whether a conjunctive LDAP query is cacheanswerable  using positive query templates. We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithm for real applications with a preliminary performance evaluation, based on sample queries from a directory enabled application at AT&T Labs. Cache-answerability is related to the problem of finding complete rewritings of a query using views (see, e.g., [8]). A key conceptual difference arises due to the fact that we do not seek a rewriting of the original query in terms of the (views in the) semantic cache description, but want to evaluate the original query against the cached directory instance. Further, the differences of the LDAP data model and query language make the previous results inapplicable; for details, see Section 2.

Mixtures of Probabilistic Principal Component Analysers Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most popular techniques for processing, compressing and visualising data, although its effectiveness is limited by its global linearity. While nonlinear variants of PCA have been proposed, an alternative paradigm is to capture data complexity by a combination of local linear PCA projections. However, conventional PCA does not correspond to a probability density, and so there is no unique way to combine PCA models. Previous attempts to formulate mixture models for PCA have therefore to some extent been ad hoc. In this paper, PCA is formulated within a maximum-likelihood framework, based on a specific form of Gaussian latent variable model. This leads to a well-defined mixture model for probabilistic principal component analysers, whose parameters can be determined using an EM algorithm. We discuss the advantages of this model in the context of clustering, density modelling and local dimensionality reduction, and we demonstrate its applicatio...

Development of a Computer Aided Geographic Database Design System This paper presents a prototype being developed at IC-UNICAMP to help environmental planners specify their application databases. The ultimate goal of the system presented is to reduce the impedance mismatch between the end-user's view of the geographic reality and its implementation in Geographic Information Systems (gis). The prototype offers users the possibility of specifying their application databases using concepts closer to their view of the world, by means of an object oriented geographic data model. This specification is mapped by the system to an intermediate object oriented schema, which can then be transformed into different underlying target geographic DBMS. The prototype was implemented using C and O2C on the O2 object oriented DBMS. 1 Introduction  A Geographic Information System -- gis, for short -- is a software that performs data management and retrieval operations for georeferenced data.

Toward Learning Visual Discrimination Strategies Humans learn strategies for visual discrimination through interaction with their environment. Discrimination skills are refined as demanded by the task at hand, and are not a priori determined by any particular feature set. Tasks are typically incompletely specified and evolve continually. This work presents a general framework for learning visual discrimination that addresses some of these characteristics. It is based on an infinite combinatorial feature space consisting of primitive features such as oriented edgels and texture signatures, and compositions thereof. Features are progressively sampled from this space in a simple-to-complex manner. A simple recognition procedure queries learned features one by one and rules out candidate object classes that do not sufficiently exhibit the queried feature. Training images are presented sequentially to the learning system, which incrementally discovers features for recognition. Experimental results on two databases of geometric objects ill...

Toward Learning Based Web Query Processing In this paper, we describe a novel Web query processing approach with learning capabilities. Under this approach, user queries are in the form of keywords and search engines are employed to find URLs of Web sites that might contain the required information. The first few URLs are presented to the user for browsing. Meanwhile, the query processor learns both the information required by the user and the way that the user navigates through hyperlinks to locate such information. With the learned knowledge, it processes the rest URLs and produces precise query results in the form of segments of Web pages without user involvement. The preliminary experimental results indicate that the approach can process a range of Web queries with satisfactory performance. The architecture of such a query processor, techniques of modeling HTML pages, and knowledge for query processing are discussed. Experiments on the effectiveness of the approach, the required knowledge, and the training strategies are presented.

A Mediation Infrastructure for Digital Library Services Digital library mediators allow interoperation between diverse information services. In this paper we describe a flexible and dynamic mediator infrastructure that allows mediators to be composed from a set of modules ("blades"). Each module implements a particular mediation function, such as protocol translation, query translation, or result merging. All the information used by the mediator, including the mediator logic itself, is represented by an RDF graph. We illustrate our approach using a mediation scenario involving a Dienst and a Z39.50 server, and we discuss the potential advantages and weaknesses of our framework.

Rough Fuzzy MLP: Modular Evolution, Rule Generation and Evaluation A methodology is described for evolving a Rough-fuzzy multi layer perceptron with modular concept using a genetic algorithm to obtain a structured network suitable for both classification and rule extraction. The modular concept, based on "divide and conquer" strategy, provides accelerated training and a compact network suitable for generating a minimum number of rules with high certainty values. The concept of variable mutation operator is introduced for preserving the localized structure of the constituting knowledge based subnetworks, while they are integrated and evolved. Rough set dependency rules are generated directly from the real valued attribute table containing fuzzy membership values. Two new indices viz., `certainty' and `confusion' in a decision are defined for evaluating quantitatively the quality of rules. The effectiveness of the model and the rule extraction algorithm is extensively demonstrated through experiments alongwith comparisons.

Fusion of Perceptual Cues for Robust Tracking of. . . The paradigm of perceptual fusion provides robust solutions to computer vision problems. By combining the outputs of multiple vision modules, the assumptions and constraints of each module are factored out to result in a more robust system overall. The integration of dierent modules can be regarded as a form of data fusion. To this end, we propose a framework for fusing dierent information sources through estimation of covariance from observations. The framework is demonstrated in a face and 3D pose tracking system that fuses similarity-to-prototypes measures and skin colour to track head pose and face position. The use of data fusion through covariance introduces constraints that allow the tracker to robustly estimate head pose and track face position simultaneously.  Key words: data fusion, pose estimation, similarity representation, face  recognition  1 Introduction  The approach we have taken to computer vision, referred to as perceptual fusion, involves the integration of multip...

An Agent-Based Framework for Financial Transactions Ever-changing Internet technologies are creating revolutions in the way people interact with each other. In particular, business interactions are rapidly transforming and evolving toward more dynamic and automated solutions. Among various on-line commercial activities, financial services represent a fundamental component for developing and supplying many other e-businesses. The main idea behind efinance  is to provide support by deploying software instruments that enable to automate many of B2B and B2C transactions. The current degree of automation and personalisation of on-line financial services is still very limited: Web interfaces or ad hoc tools still require a lots of human interactions. Agent technology seems to be one of the most promising approaches for evolving toward more flexible and dynamic solutions. Autonomous, intelligent, social and selfinterested software entities would act on behalf of final endusers and/or business operators without the need for direct human involvement. This paper describes an agent-based system supporting automated business transactions. The aim is to evaluate the main potential and the major limits of supplying financial services by deploying agents in a software environment.

The Tropos Software Development Methodology: Processes, Models And Diagrams Abstract. Tropos is a novel agent-oriented software development methodology founded on two key features: (i) the notions of agent, goal, plan and various other knowledge level concepts are fundamental primitives used uniformly throughout the software development process; and (ii) a crucial role is assigned to requirements analysis and specification when the system-to-be is analyzed with respect to its intended environment. This paper provides a (first) detailed account of the Tropos methodology. In particular, we describe the basic concepts on which Tropos is founded and the types of models one builds out of them. We also specify the analysis process through which design flows from external to system actors through a goal analysis and delegation. In addition, we provide an abstract syntax for Tropos diagrams and other linguistic constructs. 1

Using Information Extraction to Aid the Discovery of Prediction Rules from Text Text mining and Information Extraction (IE) are both topics of significant recent interest. Text mining concerns applying data mining, a.k.a. knowledge discovery from databases (KDD) techniques to unstructured text. Information extraction (IE) is a form of shallow text understanding that locates specific pieces of data in natural language documents, transforming unstructured text into a structured database. This paper describes a system called DiscoTEX, that combines IE and KDD methods to perform a text mining task, discovering prediction rules from natural-language corpora. An initial version of DiscoTEX is constructed by integrating an IE module based on Rapier and a rule-learning module, Ripper. We present encouraging results on applying these techniques to a corpus of computer job postings from an Internet newsgroup.

Cache Management in CORBA Distributed Object Systems For many distributed data intensive applications, the default remote invocation of CORBA objects by clients is not acceptable because of performance degradation. Caching enables clients to invoke operations locally on distributed objects instead of fetching them from remote servers. This paper addresses the design and implementation of a specific caching approach for CORBA-based systems. We propose a new removal algorithm which uses a double linked structure and a hash table for eviction. We also present a new variation of optimistic two phase locking for consistency control, which does not require a lock at the client side by using a perprocess caching design. With the experiments we have performed, we demonstrate that the proposed caching approach provides an important performance gain: the caching with half buffer saves up to 45% of access time and the caching with full buffer saves up to 50% of access time.

Battery-aware Static Scheduling for Distributed Real-time Embedded Systems This paper addresses battery-aware static scheduling in batterypowered  distributed real-time embedded systems. As suggested by  previous work, reducing the discharge current level and shaping  its distribution are essential for extending the battery lifespan. We  propose two battery-aware static scheduling schemes. The first  one optimizes the discharge power profile in order to maximize  the utilization of the battery capacity. The second one targets  distributed systems composed of voltage-scalable processing  elements (PEs). It performs variable-voltage scheduling via  efficient slack time re-allocation, which helps reduce the average  discharge power consumption as well as flatten the discharge  power profile. Both schemes guarantee the hard real-time  constraints and precedence relationships in the real-time  distributed embedded system specification. Based on previous  work, we develop a battery lifespan evaluation metric which is  aware of the shape of the discharge power profile. Our  experimental results show that the battery lifespan can be  increased by up to 29% by optimizing the discharge power file  alone. Our variable-voltage scheme increases the battery lifespan  by up to 76% over the non-voltage-scalable scheme and by up to  56% over the variable-voltage scheme without slack-time reallocation.  1.

MRML: An Extensible Communication Protocol for Interoperability and Benchmarking of Multimedia Information Retrieval Systems While in the area of relational databases interoperability is ensured by common communication protocols (e.g. ODBC/JDBC using SQL), Content Based Image Retrieval Systems (CBIRS) and other multimedia retrieval systems are lacking both a common query language and a common communication protocol.

Limited Logical Belief Analysis . The process of rational inquiry can be defined as the evolution of a rational agent's belief set as a consequence of its internal inference procedures and its interaction with the environment. These beliefs can be modelled in a formal way using doxastic logics. The possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they seem to commit us to model agents that are logically omniscient and perfect reasoners. These problems can be avoided with a syntactic view of possible worlds, defining them as arbitrary sets of sentences in a propositional doxastic logic. In this paper this syntactic view of possible worlds is taken, and a dynamic analysis of the agent's beliefs is suggested in order to model the process of rational inquiry in which the agent is permanently engaged. One component of this analysis, the logical one, is summarily described. This dimension of analysis is performed using a modified version of the analytic tableaux...

Exploiting Redundancy in Question Answering Our goal is to automatically answer brief factual questions of the form "When was the Battle of Hastings?" or "Who wrote The Wind in the Willows?". Since the answer to nearly any such question can now be found somewhere on the Web, the problem reduces to finding potential answers in large volumes of data and validating their accuracy. We apply a method for arbitrary passage retrieval to the first half of the problem and demonstrate that answer redundancy can be used to address the second half. The success of our approach depends on the idea that the volume of available Web data is large enough to supply the answer to most factual questions multiple times and in multiple contexts. A query is generated from a question and this query is used to select short passages that may contain the answer from a large collection of Web data. These passages are analyzed to identify candidate answers. The frequency of these candidates within the passages is used to "vote" for the most likely answer. The ...

Exploiting Context to Make Delivered Information Relevant To Tasks and Users Building truly "context-aware" environments presents a greater challenge than using data transmitted by ubiquitous computing devices: it requires shared understanding between humans and their computational environments. This essay articulates some specific problems that can be addressed by representing context. It explores the unique possibilities of design environments that model and represent domains, tasks, design guidelines, solutions and their rationale, and the larger context of such environments embedded in the physical world. Context in design is not a fixed entity sensed by devices, but it is emerging and it is unbounded. Context-aware environments must address these challenges to be more supportive to all stakeholders who design and evolve complex design artifacts.

Design Issues for Mixed-Initiative Agent Systems This paper addresses the effect of mixed-initiative systems on multiagent systems design. A mixed-initiative system is one in which humans interact directly with software agents in a collaborative approach to problem solving. There are two main levels at which multiagent systems are designed: the domain level and the individual agent level. At the domain level, there are few unique challenges to mixedinitiative system design. However, at the individual agent level, the agent itself must be designed to interact with the human and the agent system, integrating the two into a single system. Introduction  Much of the current research related to intelligent agents has focused on the capabilities and structure of individual agents. However, in order to solve complex problems, these agents must work cooperatively with other agents in a heterogeneous environment. This is the domain of  Multiagent Systems. In multiagent systems, we are interested in the coordinated behavior of a system of indiv...

Reconciling Co-Operative Planning and Automated Co-Ordination in Multiagent Systems In the context of cooperative work, the coordination of activities is provided essentially by two opposite classes of approaches, based on the notion of situated action and planning. Actually, given the complexity and dynamism of current cooperative scenarios, the need of model supporting both the approaches has emerged. A similar situation can be recognised in multiagent system coordination, where two classes of approaches are clearly distinguishable, with properties similar to the situated action and planning cases: the one, defined in literature as subjective coordination, accounts for realising coordination exclusively by means of the skills and the situated actions of the individual agents, exploiting their intelligence and communication capability. Among the other properties, these approaches promote autonomy, flexibility and intelligence in coordination processes. The other, defined in literature as objective coordination, accounts for realising coordination exploiting coordination media, which mediate agent interactions and govern them according to laws which reflect social goals and norms. Among the other properties, these approaches promote automation, efficiency, and prescriptiveness in coordination processes. In this work, the importance to support both approaches in the same coordination context is remarked, and a conceptual framework -- derived from Activity Theory -- is proposed, where both approaches effectively co-exist and work at different collaborative levels, exploiting both the flexibility and intelligence of the subjective approaches, and the prescription and automation of the objective ones.

Winner Determination in Combinatorial Auction Generalizations Combinatorial markets where bids can be submitted on bundles of items can be economically desirable coordination mechanisms in multiagent systems where the items exhibit complementarity and substitutability. There has been a surge of recent research on winner determination in combinatorial auctions. In this paper we study a wider range of combinatorial market designs: auctions, reverse auctions, and exchanges, with one or multiple units of each item, with and without free disposal. We first theoretically characterize the complexity. The most interesting results are that reverse auctions with free disposal can be approximated, and in all of the cases without free disposal, even finding a feasible solution is ##-complete. We then ran experiments on known benchmarks as well as ones which we introduced, to study the complexity of the market variants in practice. Cases with free disposal tended to be easier than ones without. On many distributions, reverse auctions with free disposal were easier than auctions with free disposal -- as the approximability would suggest -- but interestingly, on one of the most realistic distributions they were harder. Single-unit exchanges were easy, but multi-unit exchanges were extremely hard.

Feature Reduction for Neural Network Based Text Categorization In a text categorization model using an artificial neural network as the text classifier, scalability is poor if the neural network is trained using the raw feature space since textural data has a very high-dimension feature space. We proposed and compared four dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce the feature space into an input space of much lower dimension for the neural network classifier. To test the effectiveness of the proposed model, experiments were conducted using a subset of the Reuters-22173 test collection for text categorization.

Face-to-Face With Your Assistant - Realization Issues of Animated User Interface Agents for Home Appliances With the introduction of software agents and assistants, the concept of so-called social user interfaces evolved, incorporating natural language interaction, context awareness and anthropomorphic representations of visuals, scales, and degrees of freedom for interactions. Today's challenge is to build a suitable visualization architecture for anthropomorphic conversational user interfaces, and to design for  the believable and appropriate inclusion of  human attributes (such as emotions) in a face-toface  interaction. Integrated approaches to these tasks are presented here.  1

Constraint-based Processing of Multiway Spatial Joins . A multiway spatial join combines information found in three or more spatial relations with respect to some spatial predicates. Motivated by their close correspondence with constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs), we show how multiway spatial joins can be processed by systematic search algorithms traditionally used for CSPs. This paper describes two different strategies, window reduction and synchronous traversal, that take advantage of underlying spatial indexes to effectively prune the search space. In addition, we provide cost models and optimization methods that combine the two strategies to compute more efficient execution plans. Finally, we evaluate the efficiency of the proposed techniques and the accuracy of the cost models through extensive experimentation with several query and data combinations.  Key Words.

Materialized View Selection and Maintenance Using Multi-Query Optimization Materialized views have been found to be very effective at speeding up queries, and are increasingly being supported by commercial databases and data warehouse systems. However, whereas the amount of data entering a warehouse and the number of materialized views are rapidly increasing, the time window available for maintaining materialized views is shrinking. These trends necessitate efficient techniques for the maintenance of materialized views.  In this paper, we show how to find an efficient plan for the maintenance of a set of materialized views, by exploiting common subexpressions between different view maintenance expressions. In particular, we show how to efficiently select (a) expressions and indices that can be effectively shared, by transient materialization; (b) additional expressions and indices for permanent materialization; and (c) the best maintenance plan -- incremental or recomputation -- for each view. These three decisions are highly interdependent, and the choice of...

Multi-faceted Insight through Interoperable Visual Information Analysis Paradigms To gain insight and understanding of complex information collections, users must be able to visualize and explore many facets of the information. This paper presents several novel visual methods from an information analyst's perspective. We present a sample scenario, using the various methods to gain a variety of insights from a large information collection. We conclude that no single paradigm or visual method is sufficient for many analytical tasks. Often a suite of integrated methods offers a better analytic environment in today's emerging culture of information overload and rapidly changing issues. We also conclude that the interactions among these visual paradigms are equally as important as, if not more important than, the paradigms themselves.

Realising the Full Potential of Workflow Modelling: A Practical Perspective In a broad sense, a workflow provides a partial or complete automation of a process at a level above traditional implementation platforms. Much of the emphasis of workflow specifications, as deployed by workflow management systems, focuses on process execution semantics. This includes a process's pre- and post-conditions and the sequence, repetition, choice, parallelism and synchronisation which characterises inter-process triggering. The successful development of workflows requires not only this but, in general, a fuller conceptualisation  of a domain's processing, including process semantics. Given the diversity of business processing configurations, which in absence of a complete theoretical foundation, follow experience and intuition, the characterisations - indeed the cognition - of workflows still appears coarse. In this regard, a wellspring of modelling techniques, paradigms and informal-formal method extensions which address the analysis of organisational processing structures ...

A Realistic (Non-Associative) Logic And a Possible Explanations of 7&plusmn;2 Law When we know the subjective probabilities (degrees of belief) p1 and  p2 of two statements S1 and S2 , and we have no information about the relationship between these statements, then the probability of S1 &S2 can take any value from the interval [max(p1 + p2 \Gamma 1; 0); min(p1 ; p2 )]. If we must select a single number from this interval, the natural idea is to take its midpoint. The corresponding "and" operation p1 & p2  def  = (1=2) \Delta (max(p1 +p2 \Gamma 1; 0)+min(p1 ; p2)) is not associative. However, since the largest possible non-associativity degree j(a & b) & c \Gamma a & (b & c)j is equal to 1/9, this non-associativity is negligible if the realistic "granular" degree of belief have granules of width  1=9. This may explain why humans are most comfortable with  9 items to choose from (the famous "7 plus minus 2" law). We also show that the use of interval computations can simplify the (rather complicated) proofs. 1  1 In Expert Systems, We Need Estimates for the Degree of...

Current approaches to the development of cooperative information  systems are based on services to be offered by cooperating organizations,  and on the opportunity of building coordinators and brokers  on top of such services. The quality of data exchanged and provided by  different services hampers such approaches, as data of low quality can  spread all over the cooperative system. At the same time, improvement  can be based on comparing data, correcting them and disseminating high  quality data. In this paper, a service-based framework for managing data  quality in cooperative information systems is presented. An XML-based  model for data and quality data is proposed, and the design of a broker  for data, which selects the best available data from different services, is  presented. Such a broker also supports the improvement of data based on  feedbacks to source services.

Learning Comprehensible Descriptions of Multivariate Time Series Supervised classification is one of the most active areas of machine learning research. Most work has focused on classification in static domains, where an instantaneous snapshot of attributes is meaningful. In many domains, attributes are not static; in fact, it is the way they vary temporally that can make classification possible. Examples of such domains include speech recognition, gesture recognition and electrocardiograph classification. While it is possible to use ad-hoc, domain-specific techniques for "attening" the time series to a learner-friendly representation, this fails to take into account both the special problems and special heuristics applicable to temporal data and often results in unreadable concept descriptions. Though traditional time series techniques can sometimes produce accurate classi ers, few can provide comprehensible descriptions. We propose a general architecture for classification and description of multivariate time series. It employs event primitives to ana...

Dimensionality Reduction by Random Mapping: Fast Similarity Computation for Clustering When the data vectors are high-dimensional it is computationally infeasible to use data analysis or pattern recognition algorithms which repeatedly compute similarities or distances in the original data space. It is therefore necessary to reduce the dimensionality before, for example, clustering the data. If the dimensionality is very high, like in the WEBSOM method which organizes textual document collections on a Self-Organizing Map, then even the commonly used dimensionality reduction methods like the principal component analysis may be too costly. It will be demonstrated that the document classi√∏cation accuracy obtained after the dimensionality has been reduced using a random mapping method will be almost as good as the original accuracy if the √∏nal dimensionality is sufficiently large (about 100 out of 6000). In fact, it can be shown that the inner product (similarity) between the mapped vectors follows closely the inner product of the original vectors.

Visual Looming as a range sensor for mobile robots This paper describes and evaluates visual looming as a method for monocular range estimation. The looming algorithm is based on the relationship between displacements of the observer relative to an object, and the resulting change in the size of the object's image on the focal plane of the camera. Though the looming algorithm has been described in detail in prior reports, its usefulness for inexpensive, robust ranging has not been realized widely. In this paper we analyze visual looming as a visual range sensor for autonomous mobile robots. Systematic experiments with a Pioneer 1  mobile robot show that visual looming can be used to extract ranging information much as with sonar. The accuracy of the looming algorithm is found to be significantly more robust than sonar when the object whose distance is being measured is slanted relative to the robot's line of sight. On the other hand, sonar is better suited for objects that cannot be visually segmented from their background, or objects ...

Vision-Based Speaker Detection Using Bayesian Networks The development of user interfaces based on vision and speech requires the solution of a challenging statistical inference problem: The intentions and actions of multiple individuals must be inferred from noisy and ambiguous data. We argue that Bayesian network models are an attractive statistical framework for cue fusion in these applications. Bayes nets combine a natural mechanism for expressing contextual information with efficient algorithms for learning and inference. We illustrate these points through the development of a Bayes net model for detecting when a user is speaking. The model combines four simple vision sensors: face detection, skin color, skin texture, and mouth motion. We present some promising experimental results.  1 Introduction  Human-centered user-interfaces based on vision and speech present challenging sensing problems in which multiple sources of information must be combined to infer the user's actions and intentions.

Trust and Partial Typing in Open Systems of Mobile Agents . We present a partially-typed semantics for Dp, a distributed p-calculus. The semantics is designed for mobile agents in open distributed systems in which some sites may harbor malicious intentions. Nonetheless, the semantics guarantees traditional type-safety properties at  good locations by using a mixture of static and dynamic type-checking. We show how the semantics can be extended to allow trust between sites, improving performance and expressiveness without compromising type-safety. 1 Introduction  In [13] we presented a type system for controlling the use of resources in a distributed system, or network. The type system guarantees two properties:  ffl resource access is always safe, e.g. integer resources are always accessed with integers and string resources are always accessed with strings, and  ffl resource access is always authorized, i.e. resources may only be accessed by agents that have been granted permission to do so.

Incremental Document Clustering for Web Page Classification Introduction  We consider document clustering for Web pages. Traditionally, the document classification task is carried out manually. In order to assign a document to an appropriate class, people would analyze the contents of the document first. Therefore a large amount of human effort would be required. There has been some research work conducted on automatic text classification. One approach is to learn the text classifiers by using the machine learning techniques. However, these algorithms are based on a set of positive and negative training examples for learning the text classifiers. The quality of the resulting classifiers highly depends on the fitness of the training examples. There are many terms and classes in the World Wide Web (or just the Web), and many new terms and concepts are created everyday. It is quite impossible to have domain experts to identify training examples to learn a classifier for each text class in the above manner.  In order to make the document cl

An Object Oriented Multidimensional Data Model for OLAP . Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) data is frequently organized in the form of multidimensional data cubes each of which is used to examine a set of data values, called measures, associated with multiple dimensions and their multiple levels.

Applying A New Multidimentional Framework To The Evaluation Of Multiagent System Methodologies Because of the great interest in using multiagent systems (MAS) in a wide variety of applications in recent years, agentoriented methodologies and related modeling techniques have become a priority for the development of large scale agentbased systems. The work we present here belongs to the disciplines of Software Engineering and Distributed Artificial Intelligence. More specifically, we are interested in software engineering aspects involved in the development of multiagent systems (MAS). Several methodologies have been proposed for the development of MAS. For the most part, these methodologies remain incomplete: they are either an extension of object-oriented methodologies or an extension of knowledge-based methodologies. In addition, too little effort has gone into the standardization of MAS methodologies, platforms and environments. It seems obvious, therefore, that software engineering aspects of the development of MAS still remain an open field. The success of the agent paradigm requires systematic methodologies for the specification, analysis and design of "non toy" MAS applications. We here present a framework called MUCCMAS, which stands for MUltidimensional framework of Criteria for the Comparison of MAS methodologies, that enabled us to make a comparative analysis of existing main MAS methodologies. The overall results of this comparative analysis are presented here. Results from this work have also lead us to propose a unification scheme, much in the same spirit as that of UML, for MAS  methodologies. Our goal is to make MAS design and development more systematic and to contribute to the standardisation of MAS methodologies and platforms.

Needles in a Haystack: Plan Recognition in Large Spatial Domains Involving Multiple Agents While plan recognition research has been applied to a wide variety of problems, it has largely made identical assumptions about the number of agents participating in the plan, the observability of the plan execution process, and the scale of the domain. We describe a method for plan recognition in a real-world domain involving large numbers of agents performing spatial maneuvers in concert under conditions of limited observability. These assumptions differ radically from those traditionally made in plan recognition and produce a problem which combines aspects of the fields of plan recognition, pattern recognition, and object tracking. We describe our initial solution which borrows and builds upon research from each of these areas, employing a pattern-directed approach to recognize individual movements and generalizing these to produce inferences of large-scale behavior.

Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis is a novel statistical technique for the analysis of two--mode and co-occurrence data, which has applications in information retrieval and filtering, natural language processing, machine learning from text, and in related areas. Compared to standard Latent Semantic Analysis which stems from linear algebra and performs a Singular Value Decomposition of co-occurrence tables, the proposed method is based on a mixture decomposition derived from a latent class model. This results in a more principled approach which has a solid foundation in statistics. In order to avoid overfitting, we propose a widely applicable generalization of maximum likelihood model fitting by tempered EM. Our approach yields substantial and consistent improvements over Latent Semantic Analysis in a number of experiments.

Evaluating Interactive Cross-Language Information Retrieval: Document selection . The problem of finding documents that are written in a language  that the searcher cannot read is perhaps the most challenging  application of Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) technology.  The first Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) provided an  excellent venue for assessing the performance of automated CLIR techniques,  but little is known about how searchers and systems might interact  to achieve better cross-language search results than automated  systems alone can provide.

Distributed Reflective Architectures The autonomy of a system can be defined as its capability to recover from unforeseen  difficulties without any user intervention. This thesis proposal addresses a small part of  this problem, namely the detection of anomalies within a system's own operation by the  system itself. It is a response to a challenge presented by immune systems which can  distinguish between "self" and "nonself", i.e. they can recognise a "foreign" pattern (due  to a virus or bacterium) as different from those associated with the organism itself, even  if the pattern was not previously encountered. The aim is to apply this requirement to  an artificial system, where "nonself" may be any form of deliberate intrusion or random  anomalous behaviour due to a fault.  When designing reflective architectures or self-diagnostic systems, it is simpler to rely  on a single coordination mechanism to make the system work as intended. However, such  a coordination mechanism cannot be inspected or repaired by the system i...

Controlling Cooperative Problem Solving in Industrial Multi-Agent Systems using Joint Intentions One reason why Distributed AI (DAI) technology has been deployed in relatively few real-size applications is that it lacks a clear and implementable model of cooperative problem solving which specifies how agents should operate and interact in complex, dynamic and unpredictable environments. As a consequence of the experience gained whilst building a number of DAI systems for industrial applications, a new principled model of cooperation has been developed. This model, called Joint Responsibility, has the notion of joint intentions at its core. It specifies pre-conditions which must be attained before collaboration can commence and prescribes how individuals should behave both when joint activity is progressing satisfactorily and also when it runs into difficulty. The theoretical model has been used to guide the implementation of a general-purpose cooperation framework and the qualitative and quantitative benefits of this implementation have been assessed through a series of comparativ...

Distributional Clustering of Words for Text Classification This paper applies Distributional Clustering (Pereira  et al. 1993) to document classification. The approach clusters words into groups based on the distribution of class labels associated with each word. Thus, unlike some other unsupervised dimensionality-reduction techniques, such as Latent Semantic Indexing, we are able to compress the feature space much more aggressively, while still maintaining high document classification accuracy. Experimental results obtained on three real-world data sets show that we can reduce the feature dimensionality by three orders of magnitude and lose only 2% accuracy---significantly better than Latent Semantic Indexing (Deerwester et al. 1990), class-based clustering (Brown et al. 1992), feature selection by mutual information (Yang and Pederson 1997), or Markovblanket -based feature selection (Koller and Sahami 1996). We also show that less aggressive clustering sometimes results in improved classification accuracy over classification without clusteri...

A Hybrid Approach to Profile Creation and Intrusion Detection Anomaly detection involves characterizing the behaviors of individuals or systems and recognizing behavior that is outside the norm. This paper describes some preliminary results concerning the robustness and generalization capabilities of machine learning methods in creating user profiles based on the selection and subsequent classification of command line arguments. We base our method on the belief that legitimate users can be classified into categories based on the percentage of commands they use in a specified period. The hybrid approach we employ begins with the application of expert rules to reduce the dimensionality of the data, followed by an initial clustering of the data and subsequent refinement of the cluster locations using a competitive network called Learning Vector Quantization. Since Learning Vector Quantization is a nearest neighbor classifier, and new record presented to the network that lies outside a specified distance is classified as a masquerader. Thus, this system does not require anomalous records to be included in the training set. 1.

Systematic Output Modification in a 2D User Interface Toolkit In this paper we present a simple but general set of techniques for modifying output in a 2D user interface toolkit. We use a combination of simple subclassing, wrapping, and collusion between parent and output objects to produce arbitrary sets of composable output transformations. The techniques described here allow rich output effects to be added to most, if not all, existing interactors in an application, without the knowledge of the interactors themselves. This paper explains how the approach works, discusses a number of example effects that have been built, and describes how the techniques presented here could be extended to work with other toolkits. We address issues of input by examining a number of extensions to the toolkit input subsystem to accommodate transformed graphical output.

OKBC: A Programmatic Foundation for Knowledge Base Interoperability The technology for building large knowledge bases (KBs) is yet to witness a breakthrough so that a KB can be constructed by the assembly of prefabricated knowledge components. Knowledge components include both pieces of domain knowledge (for example, theories of economics or fault diagnosis) and KB tools (for example, editors and theorem provers). Most of the current KB development tools can only manipulate knowledge residing in the knowledge representation system (KRS) for which the tools were originally developed. Open Knowledge Base Connectivity (OKBC) is an application programming interface for accessing KRSs, and was developed to enable the construction of reusable KB tools. OKBC improves upon its predecessor, the Generic Frame Protocol (GFP), in several signi cant ways. OKBC can be used with a much larger range of systems because its knowledge model supports an assertional view of a KRS. OKBC provides an explicit treatment ofentities that are not frames, and it has a much better way of controlling inference and specifying default values. OKBC can be used on practically any platform because it supports network transparency and has implementations for multiple programming languages. In this paper, we discuss technical design issues faced in the development of OKBC, highlight how OKBC improves upon GFP, and report on practical experiences in using it.

Multi-Sensor Context Aware Clothing Inspired by perception in biological systems, distribution of a massive amount of simple sensing devices is gaining more support in detection applications. A focus on fusion of sensor signals instead of strong analysis algorithms, and a scheme to distribute sensors, results in new issues. Especially in wearable computing, where sensor data continuously changes, and clothing provides an ideal supporting structure for simple sensors, this approach may prove to be favourable. Experiments with a body-distributed sensor system investigate the influence of two factors that affect classification of what has been sensed: an increase in sensors enhances recognition, while adding new classes or contexts depreciates the results. Finally, a wearable computing related scenario is discussed that exploits the presence of many sensors.

Moving from GUIs to PUIs For some time, graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have been the dominant platform for human computer interaction. The GUI-based style of interaction has made computers simpler and easier to use, especially for office productivity applications. However, as the way we use computers changes and computing becomes more pervasive and ubiquitous, GUIs will not easily support the range of interactions necessary to  meet users' needs. In order to accommodate a wider range of scenarios, tasks, users, and preferences, we need to move toward interfaces that are natural, intuitive, adaptive, and unobtrusive. The aim of a new focus in HCI, called Perceptual User Interfaces (PUIs), is to make human-computer interaction more like how people interact with each other and with the world.

Array-Based Evaluation of Multi-Dimensional Queries in Object-Relational Database Systems Since multi-dimensional arrays are a natural data structure for supporting multi-dimensional queries, and object-relational database systems support multi-dimensional array ADTs, it is natural to ask if a multi-dimensional array-based ADT can be used to improve O/R DBMS performance on multi-dimensional queries.

Improving Minority Class Prediction Using Case-Specific Feature Weights This paper addresses the problem of handling skewed class distributions within the case-based learning (CBL) framework. We rst present as a baseline an informationgain-weighted CBL algorithm and apply it to three data sets from natural language processing (NLP) with skewed class distributions. Although overall performance of the baseline CBL algorithm is good, we show that the algorithm exhibits poor performance on minority class instances. We then present two CBL algorithms designed to improve the performance of minority class predictions. Each variation creates test-case-speci c feature weights by rst observing the path taken by the test case in a decision tree created for the learning task, and then using pathspeci c information gain values to create an appropriate weight vector for use during case retrieval. When applied to the NLP data sets, the algorithms are shown to signi cantly increase the accuracy of minority class predictions while maintaining or improving overall classi cation accuracy. 1

This paper proposes an agent-based approach to resource management in grid  environments, and describes an agent infrastructure that could be integrated with the grid middleware layer. This agent  infrastructure provides support for mobile agents that is scalable in the number of agents and the number of resources.

Using Dynamic Configuration to Manage A Scalable Multimedia Distribution System Multimedia applications and interfaces will change radically the way computer systems will look like in the coming years. Radio and TV broadcasting will assume a digital format and their distribution networks will be integrated to the Internet. Existing hardware and software infrastructures, however, are unable to provide all the scalability, flexibility, and quality of service that these applications require. We present a framework for building scalable and flexible multimedia distribution systems that greatly improves the possibilities for the provision of quality of service in large-scale networks. We show how to use architectural-awareness, mobile agents, and a CORBA-based framework to support dynamic (re)configuration, efficient code distribution, and fault-tolerance. This approach can be applied not only for multimedia distribution, but also for any QoS-sensitive distributed application.

Learning Complex Patterns for Document Categorization Knowledge-based approaches to document categorization make use of well elaborated and powerful pattern languages for manual writing of classification rules. Although such classification patterns have proven useful in many practical applications, algorithms for learning classifiers from examples mostly rely on much simpler representations of classification knowledge. In this paper, we describe a learning algorithm which employs a pattern language similar to languages used for manual rule editing. We focus on the learning of three specific constructs of this pattern language, namely phrases, tolerance matches of words and substring matches of words. Introduction  Manually writing document categorization rules is labor intensive and requires much expertise. This caused a growing research interest in learning systems for document categorization. Most of these systems transform pre-classified example documents into a propositional attribute-value representation. Simple attributes indicate w...

Designing Synchronous User Interface for Collaborative Applications Synchronous User interface is a medium where all objects being shared on it can be  viewed indifferently from the geographical location and its users can interact with each other  in real-time.

An XML-based runtime user interface description language for mobile computing devices In a time where mobile computing devices and embedded  systems gain importance, too much time is spent to reinventing user interfaces  for each new device. To enhance future extensibility and reusability  of systems and their user interfaces we propose a runtime user interface  description language, which can cope with constraints found in  embedded systems and mobile computing devices. XML seems to be a  suitable tool to do this, when combined with Java. Following the evolution  of Java towards XML, it is logical to introduce the concept applied  to mobile computing devices and embedded systems.  1

Overlapping B+-trees: an Implementation of a Transaction Time Access Method A new variation of Overlapping B+-trees is presented, which provides efficient indexing of transaction time and keys in a two dimensional key-time space. Modification operations (i.e. insertions, deletions and updates) are allowed at the current version, whereas queries are allowed to any temporal version, i.e. either in the current or in past versions. Using this structure, snapshot and range-timeslice queries can be answered optimally. However, the fundamental objective of the proposed method is to deliver efficient performance in case of a general pure-key query (i.e. "history of a key"). The trade-off is a small increase in time cost for version operations and storage requirements.

Ant Colony Control for Autonomous Decentralized Shop Floor Routing In this paper, we introduce a new approach to autonomous decentralized shop floor routing. Our system, which we call Ant Colony Control (AC  2  ), applies the analogy of a colony of ants foraging for food to the problem of dynamic shop floor routing. In this system, artificial ants use only indirect communication to make all shop routing decisions by altering and reacting to their dynamically changing common environment through the use of simulated pheromone trails. For simple factory layouts, we show that the emergent behavior of the colony is comparable to using the optimal routing strategy. Furthermore, as the complexity of the factory layout is increased, we show that the adaptive behavior of AC  2  evolves local decision making policies that lead to near-optimal solutions from the standpoint of global performance.  1.

Domain-Specific Keyphrase Extraction Keyphrases are an important means of document  summarization, clustering, and topic  search. Only a small minority of documents  have author-assigned keyphrases, and manually  assigning keyphrases to existing documents is  very laborious. Therefore it is highly desirable  to automate the keyphrase extraction process.  This paper shows that a simple procedure for  keyphrase extraction based on the naiveBayes  learning scheme performs comparably to the  state of the art. It goes on to explain how  this procedure's performance can be boosted by  automatically tailoring the extraction process  to the particular document collection at hand.  Results on a large collection of technical reports  in computer science show that the quality of  the extracted keyphrases improves signi#cantly  when domain-speci#c information is exploited.  1 Introduction  Keyphrases give a high-level description of a document's contents that is intended to make it easy for prospective readers to decide whether or no...

Between Information and Communication: Middle Spaces in Computer Media for Learning In this paper, we identify two categories of media that are common in computer-supported collaborative learning and software in general: communication media, and information media. These two types of media map easily on to two types of social activities in which learning is grounded: dialogue and monologue. Drawing on literature in learning theory, we suggest the need for interfaces that helpstudents transition from dialogue to monologue and back again. This "middle space" between communication and information interfaces is illustrated with several examples from CSCL. We advocate filling in this middle space with software and activities that transcend some of the traditional design tradeoffs associated with information and communication interfaces.

Design and Implementation of a High-Performance Distributed Web Crawler Broad web search engines as well as many more specialized search tools rely on web  crawlers to acquire large collections of pages for indexing and analysis. Such a web crawler  may interact with millions of hosts over a period of weeks or months, and thus issues of robustness,  flexibility, and manageability are of major importance. In addition, I/O performance,  network resources, and OS limits must be taken into account in order to achieve high performance  at a reasonable cost.  In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a distributed web crawler that  runs on a network of workstations. The crawler scales to (at least) several hundred pages per  second, is resilient against system crashes and other events, and can be adapted to various  crawling applications. We present the software architecture of the system, discuss the performance  bottlenecks, and describe efficient techniques for achieving high performance.

Creating and Evaluating Multi-Document Sentence Extract Summaries This paper discusses passage extraction approaches to multidocument summarization that use available information about  the document set as a whole and the relationships between the documents to build on single document summarization methodology. Multi-document summarization differs from single in that the issues of compression, speed, redundancy and passage selection are critical in the formation of useful summaries, as well as the user's goals in creating the summary. Our approach addresses these issues by using domain-independent techniques based mainly on fast, statistical processing, a metric for reducing redundancy and maximizing diversity in the selected passages, and a modular framework to allow easy parameterization for different genres, corpora characteristics and user requirements. We examined howhumans create multi-document summaries as well as the characteristics of such summaries and use these summaries to evaluate the performance of various multidocument summarization algorithms.  1.

Finding Code on the World Wide Web: A Preliminary Investigation To find out what kind of design structures programmers really use, we need to examine a wide variety of programs. Unfortunately most program source code is proprietary and is unavailable for analysis. The World Wide Web (Web) potentially can provide a rich source of programs for study. The freely available code on the Web, if in sufficient quality and quantity, can provide a window into software design as it is practiced today. In a preliminary study of source code availability on the Web, we estimate that 4% of URLs contain object-oriented source code, and 9% of URLs contain executable code --- either binary or class files. This represents an enormous resource for program analysis. We can, with some risk of inaccuracy, conservatively project our sampling results to the entire Web. Our estimate is that the Web contains at least 3.4 million files containing either Java, C++, or Perl source code, 20.3 million files containing C source code, and 8.7 million files containing executable code.

Lower Bounds for High Dimensional Nearest Neighbor Search and Related Problems In spite of extensive and continuing research, for various geometric search problems (such as nearest neighbor search), the best algorithms known have performance that degrades exponentially in the dimension. This phenomenon is sometimes called the curse of dimensionality. Recent results [33, 32, 35] show that in some sense it is possible to avoid the curse of dimensionality for the approximate nearest neighbor search problem. But must the exact nearest neighbor search problem suffer this curse? We provide some evidence in support of the curse. Specifically we investigate the exact nearest neighbor search problem and the related problem of exact partial match within the asymmetric communication model first used by Miltersen [38] to study data structure problems. We derive non-trivial asymptotic lower bounds for the exact problem that stand in contrast to known algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search.

Finding Location Using Omnidirectional Video on a Wearable Computing Platform In this paper we present a framework for a navigation system in an indoor environment using only omnidirectional video. Within a Bayesian framework we seek the appropriate place and image from the training data to describe what we currently see and infer a location. The posterior distribution over the state space conditioned on image similarity is typically not Gaussian. The distribution is represented using sampling and the location is predicted and verified over time using the Condensation algorithm. The system does not require complicated feature detection, but uses a simple metric between two images. Even with low resolution input, the system may achieve accurate results with respect to the training data when given favorable initial conditions.  1.

We then contribute  a new learning algorithm, WoLF policy hillclimbing,  that is based on a simple principle: "learn  quickly while losing, slowly while winning." The  algorithm is proven to be rational and we present  empirical results for a number of stochastic games  showing the algorithm converges.  1

An Overview of the Multiagent Systems Engineering Methodology . To solve complex problems, agents work cooperatively with other  agents in heterogeneous environments. We are interested in coordinating the  local behavior of individual agents to provide an appropriate system-level  behavior. The use of intelligent agents provides an even greater amount of  flexibility to the ability and configuration of the system itself. With these new  intricacies, software development is becoming increasingly difficult. Therefore,  it is critical that our processes for building the inherently complex distributed  software that must run in this environment be adequate for the task. This paper  introduces a methodology for designing these systems of interacting agents.  1.

Social and Semiotic Analyses for Theorem Prover User Interface Design : We describe an approach to user interface design based on ideas from cognitive science, social science, especially the theory of stories, and a new area tentatively called algebraic semiotics. Social analysis helps to identify coherent classes of users and their requirements, and suggests some ways to make proofs more understandable, while algebraic semiotics, which combines semiotics with algebraic specification, provides a rigorous theory of interface functionality and quality. We apply these techniques to designing user interfaces for a distributed cooperative theorem proving system, whose main component is a website generation and proof assistance tool called Kumo. This interface integrates formal proving, proof browsing, animation, informal explanation, and online background tutorials. Experience with using the interface is reported, and some conclusions are drawn. 1 Introduction  Recent large advances in performance have made it arguable that the most pressing open problems in ...

Continuous Categories For a Mobile Robot Autonomous agents make frequent use of knowledge in the form of categories --- categories of objects, human gestures, web pages, and so on. This paper describes a way for agents to learn such categories for themselves through interaction with the environment. In particular, the learning algorithm transforms raw sensor readings into clusters of time series that have predictive value to the agent. We address several issues related to the use of an uninterpreted sensory apparatus and show specific examples where a Pioneer 1 mobile robot interacts with objects in a cluttered laboratory setting.  Introduction  "There is nothing more basic than categorization to our thought, perception, action, and speech" (Lakoff 1987).

For example, such categories play an important role for a mobile robot that navigates around obstacles ...

Fuzzy Finite-state Automata Can Be Deterministically Encoded into Recurrent Neural Networks There has been an increased interest in combining fuzzy systems with neural networks because fuzzy neural systems merge the advantages of both paradigms. On the one hand, parameters in fuzzy systems have clear physical meanings and rule-based and linguistic information can be incorporated into adaptive fuzzy systems in a systematic way. On the other hand, there exist powerful algorithms for training various neural network models. However, most of the proposed combined architectures are only able to process static input-output relationships, i.e. they are not able to process temporal input sequences of arbitrary length. Fuzzy finite-state automata (FFAs) can model dynamical processes whose current state depends on the current input and previous states. Unlike in the case of deterministic finite-state automata (DFAs), FFAs are not in one particular state, rather each state is occupied to some degree defined by a membership function. Based on previous work on encoding DFAs in discrete-tim...

Efficient Learning of Reactive Robot Behaviors with a Neural-Q Learning Approach The purpose of this paper is to propose a Neural-Q_learning approach designed for online learning of simple and reactive robot behaviors. In this approach, the Q_function is generalized by a multi-layer neural network allowing the use of continuous states and actions. The algorithm uses a database of the most recent learning samples to accelerate and guarantee the convergence. Each Neural-Q_learning function represents an independent, reactive and adaptive behavior which maps sensorial states to robot control actions. A group of these behaviors constitutes a reactive control scheme designed to fulfill simple missions. The paper centers on the description of the Neural-Q_learning based behaviors showing their performance with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in a target following mission. Simulated experiments demonstrate the convergence and stability of the learning system, pointing out its suitability for online robot learning. Advantages and limitations are discussed.

Routing Through Networks with Hierarchical Topology Aggregation Abstract In the future, global networks will consist of a hierarchy of subnetworks called domains. For reasons of both scalability and security, domains will not reveal details of their internal structure to outside nodes. Instead, these domains will advertise only a summary, or aggregated view, of their internal structure, e.g., as proposed by the ATM PNNI standard. This work compares, by simulation, the performance of several different aggregation schemes in terms of network throughput (the fraction of attempted connections that are realized), and network control load (the average number of crankbacks per realized connection.) Our main results are: ffl Minimum spanning tree is a good aggregation scheme; ffl Exponential link cost functions perform better than min-hop routing; ffl Our suggested logarithmic update scheme that determine when re-aggregation should be computed can significantly reduce the computational overhead due to re-aggregation with a negligible decrease in performance. 1.

UMLi: The unified modeling language for interactive applications User interfaces (UIs) are essential components of most software systems, and significantly affect the effectiveness of installed applications. In addition, UIs often represent a significant proportion of the code delivered by a development activity. However, despite this, there are no modelling languages and tools that support contract elaboration between UI developers and application developers. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) has been widely accepted by application developers, but not so much by UI designers. For this reason, this paper introduces the notation of the Unified Modelling Language for Interactive Applications (UMLi), that extends UML, to provide greater support for UI design. UI elements elicited in use cases and their scenarios can be used during the design of activities and UI presentations. A diagram notation for modelling user interface presentations is introduced. Activity diagram notation is extended to describe collaboration between interaction and domain objects. Further, a case study using UMLi notation and method is presented.

In this paper we examine text categorization methods from a perspective that considers the tradeoff between accuracy and scalability to large data sets and large feature sizes. We start from the observation that Support Vector Machines, one of the best text categorization methods cannot scale up to handle the large document collections involved in many real word problems.

Distributed Value Functions Many interesting problems, such as power grids, network switches, and traffic flow, that are candidates for solving with reinforcement learning (RL), also have properties that make distributed solutions desirable. We propose an algorithm for distributed reinforcement learning based on distributing the representation of the value function across nodes. Each node in the system only has the ability to sense state locally, choose actions locally, and receive reward locally (the goal of the system is to maximize the sum of the rewards over all nodes and over all time). However each node is allowed to give its neighbors the current estimate of its value function for the states it passes through. We present a value function learning rule, using that information, that allows each node to learn a value function that is an estimate of a weighted sum of future rewards for all the nodes in the network. With this representation, each node can choose actions to improve the performance of the overall...

A first generation of deductive  database systems supported the notion of stratification for programs  with negation and set aggregates. Stratification is simple to understand  and efficient to implement but it is too restrictive; therefore, a second generation of systems seeks efficient support for more powerful  semantics based on notions such as well-founded models and stable  models. In this respect, a particularly powerful set of constructs is provided by the recently enhanced LDL++ system that supports (i) monotonic user-defined aggregates, (ii) XY-stratified programs, and (iii)  the nondeterministic choice constructs under stable model semantics.

Overlapping Linear Quadtrees and Spatio-Temporal Query Processing indexing in spatio-temporal databases by using the technique of overlapping is investigated. Overlapping has been previously applied in various access methods to combine consecutive structure instances into a single structure, without storing identical sub-structures. In this way, space is saved without sacrificing time performance. A new access method, overlapping linear quadtrees is introduced. This structure is able to store consecutive historical raster images, a database of evolving images. Moreover, it can be used to support query processing in such a database. Five such spatio-temporal queries along with the respective algorithms that take advantage of the properties of the new structure are introduced. The new access method was implemented and extensive experimental studies for space efficiency and query processing performance were conducted. A number of results of these experiments are presented. As far as space is concerned, these results indicate that, in the case of similar consecutive images, considerable storage is saved in comparison to independent linear quadtrees. In the case of query processing, the results indicate that the proposed algorithmic approaches outperform the respective straightforward algorithms, in most cases.

If the interfaces to these appliances were easy to use, people might benefit from these new functions. Unfortunately, it is rare to find a well-designed appliance interface. This study shows that existing appliance interfaces could be improved by using a remote control interface on a handheld computer.  Keywords: Handheld computers, remote control, appliance, Pebbles  INTRODUCTION  The problem with many appliances is that they are too complex. Some appliances need thirty or more buttons to cover all of their functions. This complexity can even make relatively simple tasks, like setting the clock on a VCR, so difficult that people avoid them.  Most appliances do not provide unambiguous feedback to users. Indicators of appliance state can be confusing. For example, on a stereo that combines a CD and tape player, it may be difficult to decide wh...

An Overview of the Tatami Project This paper describes the Tatami project at UCSD, which is developing a system to support distributed cooperative software development over the web, and in particular, the validation of concurrent distributed software. The main components of our current prototype are a proof assistant, a generator for documentation websites, a database, an equational proof engine, and a communication protocol to support distributed cooperative work. We believe behavioral specification and verification are important for software development, and for this purpose we use first order hidden logic with equational atoms. The paper also briefly describes some novel user interface design methods that have been developed and applied in the project

Using HTML Formatting to Aid in Natural Language Processing on the World Wide Web Because of its magnitude and the fact that it is not computer understandable, the World Wide Web has become a prime candidate for automatic natural language tasks. This thesis argues that there is information in the layout of a web page, and that by looking at the HTML formatting in addition to the text on a page, one can improve performance in tasks such as learning to classify segments of documents. A rich representation for web pages, the HTML Struct Tree, is described. A parsing algorithm for creating Struct Trees is presented, as well as a set of experiments that use Struct Trees as a feature set for learning to extract a company's name and location from its Web pages. Through these experiments we found that it is useful to consider the layout of a page for these tasks.  Contents 1. Acknowledgements 2 2. Motivations 3 3. Related Work 3 4. HTML Struct Trees 4  4.1.

Theory of Neuromata A finite automaton --- the so-called neuromaton, realized by a finite discrete recurrent neural network, working in parallel computation mode, is considered. Both the size of neuromata (i.e., the number of neurons) and their descriptional complexity (i.e., the number of bits in the neuromaton representation) are studied. It is proved that a constant time delay of the neuromaton output does not play a role within a polynomial descriptional complexity. It is shown that any regular language given by a regular expression of length n  is recognized by a neuromaton with \Theta(n) neurons. Further, it is proved that this network size is, in the worst case, optimal. On the other hand, generally there is not an equivalent polynomial length regular expression for a given neuromaton. Then, two specialized constructions of neural acceptors of the optimal descriptional complexity \Theta(n) for a single n--bit string recognition are described. They both require O(n  1 2 ) neurons and either O(n) con...

Inverted files and dynamic signature files for optimisation of Web Directories Web directories are taxonomies for the classification of Web documents. This kind of IR systems present a specific type of search where the document collection is restricted to one area of the category graph. This paper introduces a specific data architecture for Web directories which improves the performance of restricted searches. That architecture is based on a hybrid data structure composed of an inverted file with multiple embedded signature files. Two variants based on the proposed model are presented: hybrid architecture with total information and hybrid architecture with partial information. The validity of this architecture has been analysed by means of developing both variants to be compared with a basic model. The performance of the restricted queries was clearly improved, specially the hybrid model with partial information, which yielded a positive response under any load of the search system.

Computationally Grounded Theories of Agency In this paper, I motivate, define, and illustrate the notion of computationally grounded theories of agency. A theory of agency is said to be computationally grounded if we can give the theory an interpretation in terms of some concrete computational model. This requirement is essential if we are to claim that the theories we develop can be understood as expressing properties of real multiagent systems. After introducing and formally defining the concept of a computationally grounded theory of agency, I illustrate the idea with reference to VSK logic, a formalism for reasoning about agent systems that has a semantics defined with respect to an automata-like model of agents. VSK logic is an extension of modal epistemic logic, which allows us to represent what information is visible to an agent, what it sees, and what it knows. We are able to prove that formulae of VSK logic correspond directly to properties of agents.  1 Introduction  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a broad church, whic...

Probabilistic Object Bases There are many applications where an object oriented data model is a good way of representing  and querying data. However, current object database systems are unable to handle the  case of objects whose attributes are uncertain. In this paper, extending previous pioneering work  by Kornatzky and Shimony, we develop an extension of the relational algebra to the case of object  bases with uncertainty. We propose concepts of consistency for such object bases, together  with an NP-completeness result, and classes of probabilistic object bases for which consistency  is polynomially checkable. In addition, as certain operations involve conjunctions and disjunctions  of events, and as the probability of conjunctive and disjunctive events depends both on the  probabilities of the primitive events involved as well as on what is known (if anything) about the  relationship between the events, we show how all our algebraic operations may be performed  under arbitrary probabilistic conjunction and ...

Querying Network Directories Hierarchically structured directories have recently proliferated with the growth of the Internet, and are being used to store not only address books and contact information for people, but also personal pro les, network resource information, and network and service policies. These systems provide a means for managing scale and heterogeneity, while allowing for conceptual unity and autonomy across multiple directory servers in the network, in a way far superior to what conventional relational or object-oriented databases o er. Yet, in deployed systems today, much of the data is modeled in an ad hoc manner, and many of the more sophisticated \queries &quot; involve navigational access. In this paper, we develop the core of a formal data model for network directories, and propose a sequence of e ciently computable query languages with increasing expressive power. The directory data model can naturally represent rich forms of heterogeneity exhibited in the real world. Answers to queries expressible in our query languages can exhibit the same kinds of heterogeneity. We present external memory algorithms for the evaluation of queries posed in our directory query languages, and prove the e ciency of each algorithm in terms of its I/O complexity. Our data model and query languages share the exibility and utility of the recent proposals for semi-structured data models, while at the same time e ectively addressing the speci c needs of network directory applications, which we demonstrate by means of a representative real-life example.

Learning Reactive Robot Behaviors with a Neural-Q Learning Approach The purpose of this paper is to propose a Neural-Q_learning approach designed for online learning of simple and reactive robot behaviors. In this approach, the Q_function is generalized by a multi-layer neural network allowing the use of continuous states and actions. The algorithm uses a database of the most recent learning samples to accelerate and guarantee the convergence. Each Neural-Q_learning function represents an independent, reactive and adaptive behavior which maps sensorial states to robot control actions. A group of these behaviors constitutes a reactive control scheme designed to fulfill simple missions. The paper centers on the description of the Neural-Q_learning based behaviors showing their performance with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) in a target following mission. Simulated experiments demonstrate the convergence and stability of the learning system, pointing out its suitability for online robot learning. Advantages and limitations are discussed.

Adjustable Autonomy for a Plan Management Agent The Plan Management Agent (PMA) is an intelligent software system that is intended to aid a user in managing a potentially large and complex set of plans. Currently under development, PMA applies AI technology for modeling and reasoning about plans and processes to the development of automated support for work activities. We have developed and implemented algorithms for reasoning about richly expressive plans, which include explicit temporal constraints, temporal uncertainty, and observation actions and conditional branches. We have also developed and implemented an approach to computing the cost of a new plan in the context of existing commitments. The current version of PMA has a low level of autonomy: it makes suggestions to its user, but it does not directly act on her behalf. In this paper, we first describe the PMA system, and then briefly raise some design questions we will need to address as we increase the level of PMA's autonomy, and have it vary with the situation.

Tribeca: A System for Managing Large Databases of Network Traffic The engineers who analyze tra c on high bandwidth networks must lter and aggregate either recorded traces of network packets or live tra c from the network itself. These engineers perform operations similar to database queries, but cannot use conventional data managers because of performance concerns and a semantic mismatch between the analysis operations and the operations supported by commercial DBMSs. Tra c analysis does not require fast random access, transactional update, or relational joins. Rather, it needs fast sequential access to a stream of tra c records and the ability to lter, aggregate, de ne windows, demultiplex, and remultiplex the stream. Tribeca is an extensible, stream-oriented DBMS designed to support network tra c analysis. It combines ideas from temporal and sequence databases with an implementation optimized for databases stored on high speed ID-1 tapes or arriving in real time from the network. The paper describes Tribeca's query language, executor and optimizer as well as performance measurements of a prototype implementation. 1

Improving Response Time by Search Pruning in a Content-Based Image Retrieval System, Using Inverted File Techniques This paper describes several methods for improving query evaluation speed in a content-based image retrieval system (CBIRS). Response time is an extremely important factor in determining the usefulness of any interactive system, as has been demonstrated by human factors studies over the past thirty years. In particular, response times of less than one second are often specified as a usability requirement. It is shown that the use of inverted files facilitates the reduction of query evaluation time without significantly reducing the accuracy of the response. The performance of the system is evaluated using precision vs. recall graphs, which are an established evaluation method in information retrieval (IR), and are beginning to be used by CBIR researchers.

Improving Retrieval on Imperfect Speech Transcriptions This paper presents the results from adding several forms of query expansion to our retrieval system running on transcriptions of broadcast news from the 1997 TREC-7 spoken document retrieval track. 1  Introduction  Retrieving documents which originated as speech is complicated by the presence of errors in the transcriptions. If some method of increasing retrieval performance despite these errors could be found, then even low-accuracy recognisers could be used as part of a successful spoken document retrieval (SDR) system.

User-Centered Design and Evaluation of a Real-Time Battlefield Visualization Virtual Environment The ever-increasing power of computers and hardware rendering systems has, to date, primarily motivated the creation of visually rich and perceptually realistic virtual environment (VE) applications. Comparatively very little effort has been expended on the user interaction components of VEs. As a result, VE user interfaces are often poorly designed and are rarely evaluated with users. Although usability engineering is a newly emerging facet of VE development, user-centered design and usability evaluation in VEs as a practice still lags far behind what is needed. This paper presents a structured, iterative approach for the user-centered design and evaluation of VE user interaction. This approach consists of the iterative use of expert heuristic evaluation, followed by formative usability evaluation, followed by summative evaluation. We describe our application of this approach to a real-world VE for battlefield visualization, describe the resulting series of design iterations, and present evidence that this approach provides a cost-effective strategy for assessing and iteratively improving user interaction design in VEs. This paper is among the first to report applying an iterative, structured, user-centered design and evaluation approach to VE user interaction design.

Flexible and Scalable Digital Library Search In this report the development of a specialised search engine for a digital library is described. The proposed  system architecture consists of three levels: the conceptual, the logical and the physical level. The conceptual  level schema enables by its exposure of a domain specific schema semantically rich conceptual search. The  logical level provides a description language to achieve a high degree of flexibility for multimedia retrieval. The  physical level takes care of scalable and e#cient persistent data storage. The role, played by each level, changes  during the various stages of a search engine's lifecycle: (1) modeling the index, (2) populating and maintaining  the index and (3) querying the index. The integration of all this functionality allows the combination of both  conceptual and content-based querying in the query stage. A search engine for the Australian Open tennis  tournament website is used as a running example, which shows the power of the complete architecture and its  various components.

On Maintaining Code Mobility We introduce the aspect of maintenance to code mobility with its major problem of keeping track of code migrating through computer networks. Our approach introduces the concept of mobile, lightweight knowledge repositories to support the maintenance of applications deploying mobile code in highly distributed computing environments. Our proposed system establishes a virtual global database with information about the mobile application and its surrounding environment based on distributed structured XML-based knowledge repositories. These distributed databases provide well-defined structural query and retrieval capabilities and ensure the abstraction from programming languages and proprietary hardware platforms. Finally, we point out several future research issues in the field of maintaining mobile code with respect to automatic maintenance of applications and automatic quality checking among others.

Joins that Generalize: Text Classification Using WHIRL WHIRL is an extension of relational databases that can perform "soft joins" based on the similarity of textual identifiers; these soft joins extend the traditional operation of joining tables based on the equivalence of atomic values. This paper evaluates WHIRL on a number of inductive classification tasks using data from the World Wide Web. We show that although WHIRL is designed for more general similaritybased reasoning tasks, it is competitive with mature inductive classification systems on these classification tasks. In particular, WHIRL generally achieves lower generalization error than C4.5, RIPPER, and several nearest-neighbor methods. WHIRL is also fast---up to 500 times faster than C4.5 on some benchmark problems. We also show that WHIRL can be efficiently used to select from a large pool of unlabeled items those that can be classified correctly with high confidence.

An Efficient Method for Performing Record Deletions and Updates Using Index Scans We present a method for efficiently performing deletions and updates of records when the records to be deleted or updated are chosen by a range scan on an index. The traditional method involves numerous unnecessary lock calls and traversals of the index from root to leaves, especially when the qualifying records' keys span more than one leaf page of the index. Customers have suffered performance losses from these inefficiencies and have complained about them. Our goal was to minimize the number of interactions with the lock manager, and the number of page fixes, comparison operations and, possibly, I/Os. Some of our improvements come from increased synergy between the query planning and data manager components of a DBMS. Our patented method has been implemented in DB2 V7 to address specific customer requirements. It has also been done to improve performance on the TPC-H benchmark. 1.

Language Sensitive Text Classification It is a traditional belief that in order to scale-up to more effective retrieval and access methods modern Information Retrieval has to consider more the text content. The modalities and techniques to fit this objectives are still under discussion. More empirical evidence is required to determine the suitable linguistic levels for modeling each IR subtask (e.g. information zoning, parsing, feature selection for indexing,...) and the corresponding use of this information. In this paper an original classification model sensitive to document syntactic information and characterized by a novel inference method is described. Extensive experimental evidence has been derived on real test data and also from well-established academic test sets. The results show that a significant improvement can be derived using the proposed inference model. Also the role of linguistic preprocessing seems to provide positive effects on the performance. POS tagging and recognition of Proper Nouns received a specific experimental attention and provided significant effects on measured accuracy. 1.

We present augmented Markov models  (AMMs) as a tool for capturing such interaction dynamics on-line and in real-time, with little computational and storage overhead. We begin by describing the structure of AMMs and the algorithm for generating them, then verify the approach utilizing data from physical mobile robots performing elements of a foraging task. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the model for resolving group coordination issues arising from three sources: individual performance, group affiliation, and group performance. Corresponding respectively to these are the three experimental examples we present --- fault detection, group membership based on ability and experience, and dynamic leader selection.  1 Introduction  Learning models of the environment, other robots, and interact...

Intelligent Techniques for the Extraction and Integration of Heterogeneous Information Developing intelligent tools for the integration of information extracted from multiple heterogeneous sources is a challenging issue to effectively exploit the numerous sources available on-line in global information systems.

An object-oriented language called ODL I  3 , derived from the standard ODMG, with an underlying Description Logics, is introduced for information extraction. ODL I 3 descriptions of the information sources are exploited first to set a shared vocabulary for the sources. Information integration is performed in a semiautomatic way, by exploiting ODL I 3 descriptions of source schemas with a combination of Description Logics and clustering techniques.

Model for Unistroke Writing Time Unistrokes are a viable form of text input in pen-based user interfaces. However, they are a very heterogeneous group of gestures the only common feature being that all are drawn with a single stroke. Several unistroke alphabets have been proposed including the original Unistrokes, Graffiti, Allegro, T-Cube and MDITIM. Comparing these methods usually requires a lengthy study with many writers and even then the results are biased by the earlier handwriting experience that the writers have. Therefore, a simple descriptive model can make these comparisons easier. In this paper we propose a model for predicting the writing time for an expert user on any given unistroke alphabet thus enabling sounder argumentation on the properties of different writing methods.

Optimizing OID Indexing Cost in Temporal Object-Oriented Database Systems In object-oriented database systems (OODB) with logical OIDs, an OID index (OIDX) is needed to map from OID to the physical location of the object. In a transaction time temporal OODB, the OIDX should also index the object versions. In this case, the index entries, which we call object descriptors (OD), also include the commit timestamp of the transaction that created the object version. In this report, we develop an analytical model for OIDX access costs in temporal OODBs. The model includes the index page buffer as well as an OD cache. We use this model to study access cost and optimal use of memory for index page buffer and OD cache, with different access patterns. The results show that 1) the OIDX access cost can be high, and can easy become a bottleneck in large temporal OODBs, 2) the optimal OD cache size can be relatively large, and 3) the gain from using an optimal size is considerable, and because access pattern in a database system can be very dynamic, the system should be ab...

Towards a Highly-Scalable Metasearch Engine The World Wide Web has been expanding in a very fast rate. The coverage of the Web by each of the major search engines has been steadily decreasing despite their effort to index more web pages. Worse yet, as these search engines get larger, higher percentages of their indexed information are becoming obsolete. More and more people are having doubt about the scalability of centralized search engine technology. A more scalable alternative to search the Web is the metasearch engine approach. A metasearch engine can be considered as an interface on top of multiple local search engines to provide uniform access to many local search engines. Database selection is one of the main challenges in building a large-scale metasearch engine. The problem is to efficiently and accurately determine a small number of potentially useful local search engines to invoke for each user query. In order to enable accurate selection, metadata that reflect the content of each search engine need to be co...

Using Probabilistic Knowledge and Simulation to Play Poker Until recently, artificial intelligence researchers who use games as their experimental testbed have concentrated on games of perfect information. Many of these games have been amenable to brute-force search techniques. In contrast, games of imperfect information, such as bridge and poker, contain hidden information making similar search techniques impractical. This paper describes recent progress in developing a high-performance pokerplaying program. The advances come in two forms. First, we introduce a new betting strategy that returns a probabilistic betting decision, a probability triple, that gives the likelihood of a fold, call or raise occurring in a given situation. This component unifies all the expert knowledge used in the program, does a better job of representing the type of decision making needed to play strong poker, and improves the way information is propagated throughout the program. Second, real-time simulations are used to compute the expected values of betting decisions. The program generates an instance of the missing data, subject to any constraints that have been learned, and then simulates the rest of the game to determine a numerical result. By repeating this a sufficient number of times, a statistically meaningful sample is used in the program‚Äôs decision‚Äìmaking process. Experimental results show that these enhancements each represent major advances in the strength of computer poker programs. 1.

On the Scalability of Simple Genetic Algorithms Scalable evolutionary computation has become an intensively studied research topic in recent years. The issue of scalability is predominant in any eld of algorithmic design, but it became particularly relevant for the design of competent genetic algorithms once the scalability problems of simple genetic algorithms were understood. Here we present some of the work that has aided in getting a clear insight in the scalability problems of simple genetic algorithms. Particularly, we discuss the important issue of building block mixing and show how the need for mixing places a boundary in the GA parameter space that together with the boundary from the schema theorem delimits the region where the GA converges reliably to the optimum of problems of bounded diculty. This region - or sweet spot as it has been called - shrinks unfortunately very rapidly with increasing problem size unless the building blocks are tightly linked in the problem-coding structure.

Bare-Hand Human-Computer Interaction In this paper, we describe techniques for barehanded interaction between human and computer. Barehanded means that no device and no wires are attached to the user, who controls the computer directly with the movements of his/her hand. Our approach is centered on the needs of the user. We therefore define requirements for real-time barehanded interaction, derived from application scenarios and usability considerations. Based on those requirements a finger-finding and hand-posture recognition algorithm is developed and evaluated. To demonstrate the strength of the algorithm, we build three sample applications. Finger tracking and hand posture recognition are used to paint virtually onto the wall, to control a presentation with hand postures, and to move virtual items on the wall during a brainstorming session. We conclude the paper with user tests, which were conducted to prove the usability of bare-hand human computer interaction.

Utility Theory-Based User Models for Intelligent Interface Agents . An underlying problem of current interface agent research is the failure to adequately address effective and efficient knowledge representations and associated methodologies suitable for modeling the users' interactions with the system. These user models lack the representational complexity to manage the uncertainty and dynamics involved in predicting user intent and modeling user behavior. A utility theory-based approach is presented for effective user intent prediction by incorporating the ability to explicitly model users' goals, the uncertainty in the users' intent in pursuing these goals, and the dynamics of users' behavior. We present an interface agent architecture, CIaA, that incorporates our approach and discuss the integration of CIaA with three disparate domains --- a probabilistic expert system shell, a natural language input database query system, and a virtual space plane ---that are being used as test beds for our interface agent research.

HySpirit - a Probabilistic Inference Engine for Hypermedia Retrieval in Large Databases . HySpirit is a retrieval engine for hypermedia retrieval integrating concepts from information retrieval (IR) and deductive databases. The logical view on IR models retrieval as uncertain inference, for which we use probabilistic reasoning. Since the expressiveness of classical IR models is not sufficient for hypermedia retrieval, HySpirit is based on a probabilistic version of Datalog. In hypermedia retrieval, different nodes may contain contradictory information; thus, we introduce probabilistic four-valued Datalog. In order to support fact queries as well as contentbased retrieval, HySpirit is based on an open world assumption, but allows for predicate-specific closed world assumptions. For performing efficient retrieval on large databases, our system provides access to external data. We demonstrate the application of HySpirit by giving examples for retrieval on images, structured documents and large databases. 1 Introduction  Due to the advances in hardware, processing of multimed...

Dynamic Belief Analysis The process of rational inquiry can be defined as the evolution of the beliefs of a rational agent as a consequence of its internal inference procedures and its interaction with the environment. These beliefs can be modelled in a formal way using belief logics. The possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they commit us to model agents that are  logically omniscient and perfect reasoners. These problems can be avoided with a syntactic view of possible worlds, defining them as arbitrary sets of sentences in a propositional belief logic. In this article this syntactic view of possible worlds is taken, and a dynamic analysis of the beliefs of the agent is suggested in order to model the process of rational inquiry in which the agent is permanently engaged. 1 INTRODUCTION  The aim of this work  1  is to model the process of rational inquiry, i.e. the (rationally controlled) transformation of the beliefs of an intelligent...

Issues with Meta-Knowledge This article approaches these questions from our di#erent viewpoints  a  :  The Constructors: Motta and Kalfoglou focus on the construction of knowledge base systems (KBS) using two special kinds of meta-knowledge: ontologies [14,33] and problem solving methods (PSMs) [26,6]. PSMs model the useful inference patterns seen in previous applications. Such patterns, it is argued, simplify and clarify future implementations. Ontologies model common domain terminology. This terminology might include the data structures required by a PSM. Using a good ontology, it is argued, can guide developers in the construction of new systems.

A Comparative Study of Classification Based Personal E-mail Filtering . This paper addresses personal E-mail filtering by casting it in the  framework of text classification. Modeled as semi-structured documents, Email  messages consist of a set of fields with predefined semantics and a number  of variable length free-text fields. While most work on classification either  concentrates on structured data or free text, the work in this paper deals with  both of them. To perform classification, a naive Bayesian classifier was  designed and implemented, and a decision tree based classifier was  implemented. The design considerations and implementation issues are  discussed. Using a relatively large amount of real personal E-mail data, a  comprehensive comparative study was conducted using the two classifiers. The  importance of different features is reported. Results of other issues related to  building an effective personal E-mail classifier are presented and discussed. It is  shown that both classifiers can perform filtering with reasonable accuracy.  While the decision tree based classifier outperforms the Bayesian classifier  when features and training size are selected optimally for both, a carefully  designed naive Bayesian classifier is more robust.  1

Towards Web-Scale Web Archeology Web-scale Web research is difficult. Information on the Web is vast in quantity, unorganized and uncatalogued, and available only over a network with varying reliability. Thus, Web data is difficult to collect, to store, and to manipulate efficiently. Despite these difficulties, we believe performing Web research at Web-scale is important. We have built a suite of tools that allow us to experiment on collections that are an order of magnitude or more larger than are typically cited in the literature. Two key components of our current tool suite are a fast, extensible Web crawler and a highly tuned, in-memory database of connectivity information. A Web page repository that supports easy access to and storage for billions of documents would allow us to study larger data sets and to study how the Web evolves over time.

Switch Packet Arbitration via Queue-Learning In packet switches, packets queue at switch inputs and contend for outputs. The contention arbitration policy directly affects switch performance. The best policy depends on the current state of the switch and current traffic patterns. This problem is hard because the state space, possible transitions, and set of actions all grow exponentially with the size of the switch. We present a reinforcement learning formulation of the problem that decomposes the value function into many small independent value functions and enables an efficient action selection. 1

G'day Mate. Let me Introduce you to Everyone: An Infrastructure for Scalable Human-System Interaction We are exposed to physical and virtual systems every day. They consist of computers, PDAs, wireless devices and increasingly, robots. Each provides services to individual or groups of users whether they are local or remote to the system. Services offered by these systems may be useful beyond these users to others, however connecting many of these systems to more users presents a challenging problem. The primary goal of the research presented in this paper is to demonstrate a scalable approach for connecting multiple users to the services provided by multiple systems. Such an approach must be simple, robust and general to contend with the heterogeneous capabilities of the services. An infrastructure is presented that addresses these scalability requirements and establishes the foundation for contending with heterogeneous services. Additionally, it allows services to be linked to form higher-level abstractions. The infrastructure is demonstrated in simulation on several similar multirobot systems with multiple users. The results propose it as a solution for large-scale human-system interaction.

Active Information Gathering in InfoSleuth . InfoSleuth  1  is an agent-based system that can be configured to perform many different information management activities in a distributed environment. InfoSleuth agents provide a number of complex query services that require resolving ontology-based queries over dynamically changing, distributed, heterogeneous resources. These include distributed query processing, location-independent single-resource updates, event and information monitoring, statistical or inferential data analysis, and trend discovery in complex event streams. It has been used in numerous applications, including the Environmental Data Exchange Network and the Competitive Intelligence System. 1 Introduction  In the past 15-20 years, numerous products and prototypes have regularly appeared to provide uniform access to heterogeneous data sources. As a result, that access to heterogeneous sources is now taken as a "given" by customers. Current MCC studies indicate that, given the availability of products that achieve...

Semantic Integration of Semistructured and Structured Data Sources this paper is to describe the MOMIS [4, 5] (Mediator envirOnment for Multiple Information Sources) approach to the integration and query of multiple, heterogeneous information sources, containing structured and semistructured data. MOMIS has been conceived as a joint collaboration between University of Milano and Modena in the framework of the INTERDATA national research project, aiming at providing methods and tools for data management in Internet-based information systems. Like other integration projects [1, 10, 14], MOMIS follows a "semantic approach" to information integration based on the conceptual schema, or metadata, of the information sources, and on the following architectural elements: i) a common object-oriented data model, defined according to the ODL I 3 language, to describe source schemas for integration purposes. The data model and ODL I 3 have been defined in MOMIS as subset of the ODMG-93 ones, following the proposal for a standard mediator language developed by the I

Transformation-Based Bottom-Up Computation of the Well-Founded Model We present a bottom-up algorithm for the computation of the well-founded model of non-disjunctive logic programs. Our method is based on the notion of conditional facts and elementary program transformations studied by Bras and Dix [BD94, BD97, BD98b]. However, their "residual program" can grow to exponential size, whereas for function free programs our "program remainder" is always polynomial in the size of the extensional database (EDB). Our approach is also closely related to the alternating fixpoint procedure [VG89, VG93]. However, the alternating fixpoint procedure is known to have inefficiencies due to redundant recomputations of possible facts. By using conditional facts that can be deleted directly instead of recomputing the complement our approach is guaranteed to need not more work than the alternating fixpoint procedure and to be much more efficient in many cases. The magic set transformation as a method for bottom-up query answering is known to have problems with undefined magic facts in the context of the well-founded semantics. However, our approach treats magic set transformed programs correctly, i.e. it always computes a relevant part of the well-founded model of the original program. We show that our approach is guaranteed to need not more work than the well-founded magic sets method [KSS95] or the magic alternating fixpoint procedure [Mor96] and is much more efficient for many programs. Again the use of conditional facts gives valuable information to select the right magic facts to use and to avoid redundant recomputations.

Recognizing End-User Transactions in Performance Management Providing good quality of service (e.g., low response times) in distributed computer systems requires measuring end-user perceptions of performance. Unfortunately, in practice such measures are often expensive or impossible to obtain. Herein, we propose a machine learning approach to recognizing end-user transactions consisting of sequences of remote procedure calls (RPCs) received at a server. Two problems are addressed. The first is labeling previously segmented transaction instances with the correct transaction type. This is akin to work done in document classification. The second problem is segmenting RPC sequences into transaction instances. This is a more difficult problem, but it is similar to segmenting sounds into words as in speech understanding. Using Naive Bayes, we tackle the labeling problem with four combinations of feature vectors and probability distributions: RPC occurrences with the Bernoulli distribution and RPC counts with the multinomial, geometric, and shifted ge...

A Content-Based Image Meta-Search Engine using Relevance Feedback Search engines are the most powerful resources for finding information on the rapidly expanding World-Wide Web. Finding the desired search engines and learning how to use them, however, can be very time consuming. Metasearch engines, which integrate a group of such search tools, enable users to access information across the world in a transparent and more efficient manner. The recent emergence of visual information retrieval (VIR) systems on the Web is leading to the same efficiency problem. This paper describes MetaSEEk, a meta-search engine used for retrieving images based on their visual content on the Web. MetaSEEk is designed to intelligently select and interface with multiple on-line image search engines by ranking their performance for different classes of user queries. User feedback is also integrated in the ranking refinement. MetaSEEk has been developed to explore the issues involved in querying large, distributed, on-line visual information system sources.

Novel computational artifacts based on these technologies may become `invisible', or reside in the background, in several different ways:  Truly invisible - when the actual computer and its interface is almost totally integrated with an environment that is familiar to the user. The user interaction model is implicit and perhaps even unnoticeable to the user. Such a system truly resides in the background of the user's attention at all times.  Transparent - here the `invisible' UI is not invisible in the literal sense. Rather, it is transparent in the same sense as a very familiar tool is transparent to its user, to the point where it almost acts as an extension of one's body.

An Evaluation of Linguistically-motivated Indexing Schemes In this article, we describe a number of indexing experiments based on indexing terms other than simple keywords. These experiments were conducted as one step in validating a linguistically-motivated indexing model. The problem is important but not new. What is new in this approach is the variety of schemes evaluated. It is important since it should not only help to overcome the well-known problems of bag-of-words representations, but also the difficulties raised by non-linguistic text simplification techniques such as stemming, stop-word deletion, and term selection. Our approach in the selection of terms is based on part-of-speech tagging and shallow parsing. The indexing schemes evaluated vary from simple keywords to nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, adjacent word-pairs, and head-modifier pairs. Our findings apply to Information Retrieval and most of related areas.

Engineering a multi-purpose test collection for Web retrieval experiments Past research into text retrieval methods for the Web has been restricted by the lack of a  test collection capable of supporting experiments which are both realistic and reproducible.  The 1.69 million document WT10g collection is proposed as a multi-purpose testbed for  experiments with these attributes, in distributed IR, hyperlink algorithms and conventional  ad hoc retrieval.  WT10g was constructed by selecting from a superset of documents in such a way that  desirable corpus properties were preserved or optimised. These properties include: a high  degree of inter-server connectivity, integrity of server holdings, inclusion of documents related  to a very wide spread of likely queries, and a realistic distribution of server holding sizes. We  conrm that WT10g contains exploitable link information using a site (homepage) nding  experiment.

Semantic Query Optimization through Abduction and Constraint Handling . The use of integrity constraints to perform Semantic Query Optimization (SQO) in deductive databases can be formalized in a way similar to the use of integrity constraints in Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) and the use of Constraint Handling Rules in Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). Based on this observation and on the similar role played by, respectively, extensional, abducible and constraint predicates in SQO, ALP and CLP, we present a unified framework from which (variants of) SQO, ALP and CLP can be obtained as special instances. The framework relies on a proof procedure which combines backward reasoning with logic programming clauses and forward reasoning with integrity constraints. 1 Introduction  Semantic Query Optimization (SQO) in deductive databases uses implicit knowledge coded in Integrity Constraints (ICs) to transform queries into new queries that are easier to evaluate and ideally contain only atoms of extensional predicates.

Agent-Based Social Simulation with Coalitions in Social Reasoning There is a growing belief that the agents' cognitive structures play a central role on the enhancement of predicative capacities of decision-making strategies. This paper analyses and simulates the construction of cognitive social structures in the process of decision making with multiple actors. In this process it is argued that the agent's rational choices may be assessed by its motivations, according to different patterns of social interactions. We first construct an abstract model of social dependence between agents, and define a set of social structures that are easily identifiable according to potential interactions. We then carry out a set of experiments at micro-social levels of analysis, where the agents' cognitive structures are explicitly represented. These experiments indicate that different social dependence structures imply distinct structural patterns of negotiation proposals, which appear to have diverse patterns of complexity in the search space. It is subsequently shown that this observation emerges as an issue of ambiguity in the regulation of different decision-making criteria, relative to motivation-oriented and utility-oriented choices. In the scope of this ambiguity, we finally make some conjectures relative to further analytical and empirical analysis around the relation between patterns of complexity of social structures and decision-making.

Identifying Linkage Groups by Nonlinearity/Non-monotonicity Detection This paper presents and discusses direct  linkage identification procedures based  on nonlinearity/non-monotonicity detection.  The algorithm we propose checks arbitrary  nonlinearity/non-monotonicity of fitness  change by perturbations in a pair of  loci to detect their linkage. We first discuss  condition of the linkage identification by  nonlinearity check (LINC) procedure (Munetomo  & Goldberg, 1998) and its allowable  nonlinearity. Then we propose another condition  of the linkage identification by nonmonotonicity  detection (LIMD) and prove its  equality to the LINC with allowable nonlinearity  (LINC-AN). The procedures can identify  linkage groups for problems with at most  order-k difficulty by checking O(2  k  ) strings  and the computational cost for each string is  O(l  2  ) where l is the string length.  1 Introduction  The definition of linkage in genetics is `the tendency for alleles of different genes to be passed together from one generation to the next' (Winter, Hickey...

Continuous Conceptual Set Covering: Learning Robot Operators From Examples Continuous Conceptual Set Covering (CCSC) is  an algorithm that uses engineering knowledge to  learn operator effects from training examples.  The program produces an operator hypothesis  that, even in noisy and nondeterministic  domains, can make good quantitative  predictions. An empirical evaluation in the traytilting  domain shows that CCSC learns faster  than an alternative case-based approach. The  best results, however, come from integrating  CCSC and the case-based approach.  Figure 1. Experimental Set Up  1. INTRODUCTION  Initially, the robot knows how to physically execute the tilt_operator. It does not, however, know the effects of the operator. When the tray-tilt operator is executed, the robot tips the tray down 30 from the horizontal in the direction of tilt.

Common Sense and Maximum Entropy This paper concerns the question of how to draw inferences common sensically from uncertain knowledge. Since the early work of Shore and Johnson, [10], Paris and Vencovsk a, [6], and Csisz√°r, [1], it has been known that the Maximum Entropy Inference Process is the only inference process which obeys certain common sense principles of uncertain reasoning. In this paper we consider the present status of this result and argue that within the rather narrow context in which we work this complete and consistent mode of uncertain reasoning is actually characterised by the observance of just a single common sense principle (or slogan).

Decomposition of Object-Oriented Database Schemas Based on F-logic, we specify an advanced data model with object-oriented and  logic-oriented features. For this model we study the decomposition of a class, the  counterpart to the well-known decomposition of a relation scheme under functional  dependencies. For this decomposition of a class, the transformation pivoting is  used. Pivoting transplants some attributes of the class to a newly generated class.  This new class is a subclass of the result class of the so-called pivot attribute. The  pivot attribute maintains the link between the original class and the new subclass.  We identify the conditions for the output of pivoting being equivalent with its  input. Additionally, we show under which conditions a schema with functional  dependencies can be recursively transformed into an equivalent one without nonkey  functional dependencies.  1 Introduction  The theory of database schema design aims at formally characterising \good" schemas and at inventing algorithms to measure and to im...

Deliberate Normative Agents: Principles and Architecture . In this paper norms are assumed to be useful in agent societies. It is claimed that not only following norms, but also the possibility of `intelligent' norm violation can be useful. Principles for agents that are able to behave deliberately on the basis of explicitly represented norms are identified and an architecture is introduced. Using this agent architecture, norms can be communicated, adopted and used as meta-goals on the agent's own processes. As such they have impact on deliberation about goal generation, goal selection, plan generation and plan selection. 1 Introduction Besides autonomy, an important characteristic of agents is that they can react to a changing environment. However, if the protocols that they use to react to (at least some part of) the environment are fixed, they have no ways to respond to impredictable changes. For instance, if an agent notices that another agent is cheating it cannot switch to another protocol to protect itself. (At least this is ...

Training Teams with Collaborative Agents . Training teams is an activity that is expensive, time-consuming,  hazardous in some cases, and can be limited by availability of equipment and  personnel. In team training, the focus is on optimizing interactions, such as  efficiency of communication, conflict resolution and prioritization, group  situation awareness, resource distribution and load balancing, etc. This paper  presents an agent-based approach to designing intelligent team training systems.  We envision a computer-based training system in which teams are trained by  putting them through scenarios, which allow them to practice their team skills.  There are two important roles that intelligent agents can play; these are as  virtual team members and as coach. To carry out these functions, these agents  must be equipped with an understanding of the task domain, the team structure,  the selected decision-making process and their belief about other team  members' mental states.  1 Introduction  An integral element of large c...

Combining Positional Information with Visual Media By integrating visual media with positioning information obtained with our wearable computer, we create new opportunities for using visuals both in the field and at the workstation. The position information we store with each visual is direction, pitch, roll, location, focal length, and zoom. This information allows any system to reconstruct the frustum of the visual, and, if height data is available to reconstruct which parts of the earth are visible in the visual. This enables position based lookup and 3D mosaicing of visuals to reconstruct a 3D model.  1 Introduction  We are interested in the association of media files with contextual information gathered by our wearable computer.

A Web-based Information System that Reasons with Structured Collections of Text The degree to which information sources are pre-processed by Web-based information systems varies greatly. In search engines like Altavista, little pre-processing is done, while in "knowledge integration" systems, complex site-specific "wrappers" are used integrate different information sources into a common database representation. In this paper we describe an intermediate between these two models. In our system, information sources are converted into a highly structured collection of small fragments of text. Databaselike queries to this structured collection of text fragments are approximated using a novel logic called WHIRL, which combines inference in the style of deductive databases with ranked retrieval methods from information retrieval. WHIRL allows queries that integrate information from multiple Web sites, without requiring the extraction and normalization of object identifiers that can be used as keys; instead, operations that in conventional databases require equality tests...

Case-Based Learning Algorithms Abstract. Storing and using specific instances improves the performance of several supervised learning algorithms. These include algorithms that learn decision trees, classification rules, and distributed networks. However, no investigation has analyzed algorithms that use only specific instances to solve incremental learning tasks. In this paper, we describe a framework and methodology, called instance-based learning, that generates classification predictions using only specific instances. Instance-based learning algorithms do not maintain a set of abstractions derived from specific instances. This approach extends the nearest neighbor algorithm, which has large storage requirements. We describe how storage requirements can be significantly reduced with, at most, minor sacrifices in learning rate and classification accuracy. While the storage-reducing algorithm performs well on several realworld databases, its performance degrades rapidly with the level of attribute noise in training instances. Therefore, we extended it with a significance test to distinguish noisy instances. This extended algorithm's performance degrades gracefully with increasing noise levels and compares favorably with a noise-tolerant decision tree algorithm.

More specifically, in this method, multiple servers cooperatively perform dynamic programming procedures for solving a combinatorial optimization problem by using the private information sent from agents as inputs. Although the severs can compute the optimal solution correctly, the inputs are kept secret even from the servers.

An Incremental Learning Algorithm with Automatically Derived Discriminating Features We propose a new technique which incrementally derive discriminating features in the input space. This technique casts both classification problems (class labels as outputs) and regression problems (numerical values as outputs) into a unified regression problem. The virtual labels are formed by clustering in the output space. We use these virtual labels to extract discriminating features in the input space. This procedure is performed recursively. We organize the resulting discriminating subspace in a coarse-to-fine fashion and store the information in a decision tree. Such an incrementally hierarchical discriminating regression (IHDR) decision tree can be realized as a hierarchical probability distribution model. We also introduce a sample size dependent negativelog -likelihood (NLL) metric to deal with large-sample size cases, small-sample size cases, and unbalanced-sample size cases. This is very essential since the number of training samples per class are different at each internal node of the IHDR tree. We report experimental results for two types of data: face image data along with comparison with some major appearance-based method and decision trees, hall way images with driving directions as outputs for the automatic navigation problem -- a regression application.

Inducing Conceptual User Models Usually, performance is the primary objective in systems that make use of user modeling (Um) techniques. But since machine learning (Ml) in user modeling addresses several issues in the context of human computer interaction (Hci), the requirements on "performance" are manifold. Thus, machine learning for user modeling (Ml4Um) has to meet several demands in order to satisfy the aims of involved disciplines. In this article we describe the application of a rather unusual Ml method to Um, namely inductive logic programming (Ilp). Though not primarily associated with efficient learning methods, we motivate the use of Ilp by showing translucency of derived user models and the explanatory potential of such models during a user adapted filtering process. In course of the OySTER project our goal is to induce conceptual user models that allow for a transparent query refinement and information filtering in the domain of Www meta--search. 1 Introduction: Why Conceptual User Models?...

BOA: The Bayesian Optimization Algorithm In this paper, an algorithm based on the concepts of genetic algorithms that uses an estimation of a probability distribution of promising solutions in order to generate new candidate solutions is proposed. To estimate the distribution, techniques for modeling multivariate data by Bayesian networks are used. The proposed algorithm identifies, reproduces and mixes building blocks up to a specified order. It is independent of the ordering of the variables in the strings representing the solutions. Moreover, prior information about the problem can be incorporated into the algorithm. However, prior information is not essential. Preliminary experiments show that the BOA outperforms the simple genetic algorithm even on decomposable functions with tight building blocks as a problem size grows. 1 INTRODUCTION Recently, there has been a growing interest in optimization methods that explicitly model the good solutions found so far and use the constructed model to guide the fu...

Measuring Search Engine Quality The effectiveness of twenty public search engines is evaluated using TREC-inspired methods  and a set of 54 queries taken from real Web search logs. The World Wide Web is taken as the  test collection and a combination of crawler and text retrieval system is evaluated. The engines  are compared on a range of measures derivable from binary relevance judgments of the first  seven live results returned. Statistical testing reveals a significant difference between engines  and high inter-correlations between measures. Surprisingly, given the dynamic nature of the  Web and the time elapsed, there is also a high correlation between results of this study and  a previous study by Gordon and Pathak. For nearly all engines, there is a gradual decline  in precision at increasing cutoff after some initial fluctuation. Performance of the engines as  a group is found to be inferior to the group of participants in the TREC-8 Large Web task,  although the best engines approach the median of those systems. Shortcomings of current  Web search evaluation methodology are identified and recommendations are made for future  improvements. In particular, the present study and its predecessors deal with queries which are  assumed to derive from a need to find a selection of documents relevant to a topic. By contrast,  real Web search reflects a range of other information need types which require different judging  and different measures.

In this paper we discuss the main issues in performance tuning of such systems, namely striping and load balancing, and show their relationship to response time and throughput. We outline the main components of an intelligent, self-reliant file system that aims to optimize striping by taking into account the requirements of the applications, and performs load balancing by judicious file allocation and dynamic redistributions of the data when access patterns change. Our system uses simple but effective heuristics that incur only little overhead. We present performance experiments based on synthetic workloads and real-life traces.

Stable Haptic Interaction with Virtual Environments A haptic interface is a kinesthetic link between a human operator and a virtual environment. This paper addresses fundamental stability and performance issues associated with haptic interaction. It generalizes and extends the concept of a virtual coupling network, an artificial link between the haptic display and a virtual world, to include both the impedance and admittance models of haptic interaction. A benchmark example exposes an important duality between these two cases. Linear circuit theory is used to develop necessary and sufficient conditions for the stability of a haptic simulation, assuming the human operator and virtual environment are passive. These equations lead to an explicit design procedure for virtual coupling networks which give maximum performance while guaranteeing stability. By decoupling the haptic display control problem from the design of virtual environments, the use of a virtual coupling network frees the developer of haptic-enabled virtual reality models fr...

OBSERVER: An Approach for Query Processing in Global Information Systems based on Interoperation across Pre-existing Ontologies . There has been an explosion in the types, availability and volume of data accessible in an information system, thanks to the World Wide Web (the Web) and related inter-networking technologies. In this environment, there is a critical need to replace or complement earlier database integration approaches and current browsing and keyword-based techniques with concept-based approaches. Ontologies are increasingly becoming accepted as an important part of any concept or semantics based solution, and there is increasing realization that any viable solution will need to support multiple ontologies that may be independently developed and managed. In particular, we consider the use of concepts from pre-existing real world domain ontologies for describing the content of the underlying data repositories. The most challenging issue in this approach is that of vocabulary sharing, which involves dealing with the use of different terms or concepts to describe similar information. In this paper, we ...

By combining other sources of context with the pendant we can reduce the number and complexity of gestures while maintaining functionality. As users input gestures, the system can also analyze their movements for pathological tremors. This information can then be used for medical diagnosis, therapy, and emergency services.Currently, the Gesture Pendant can recognize control gestures with an accuracy of 95% and user defined gestures with an accuracy of 97% It can detect tremors above 2HZ within /- Hz.

Similarly to the RMI technique, a notion of client-side stub, called startpoint, is used to communicate transparently with a server-side stub, called endpoint. Objects and associated endpoints are allowed to migrate. Our approach takes care of routing method calls using an algorithm that we studied in [22]. The purpose of this paper is to present and evaluate the implementation of this algorithm in Java. In particular, two different strategies for routing method invocations are investigated, namely call forwarding and referrals. The result of our experimentation shows that the latter can be more efficient by up to 19%.  1

WebMate: A Personal Agent for Browsing and Searching The World-Wide Web is developing very fast. Currently, #nding useful information  on the Web is a time consuming process. In this paper, we presentWebMate, an  agent that helps users to e#ectively browse and search the Web. WebMate extends  the state of the art in Web-based information retrieval in manyways. First, it uses  multiple TF-IDF vectors to keep track of user interests in di#erent domains. These  domains are automatically learned byWebMate. Second, WebMate uses the Trigger  Pair Model to automatically extract keywords for re#ning document search. Third,  during search, the user can provide multiple pages as similarity#relevance guidance  for the search. The system extracts and combines relevantkeywords from these relevant  pages and uses them for keyword re#nement. Using these techniques, WebMate  provides e#ective browsing and searching help and also compiles and sends to users  personal newspaper by automatically spiding news sources. Wehave experimentally  evaluated the performance of the system.

On the Expressiveness of Event Notification in Data-driven Coordination Languages JavaSpaces and TSpaces are two coordination middlewares for distributed Java programming recently proposed by Sun and IBM, respectively. They extend the data-driven coordination model of Linda with an event notification mechanism: a process can register interest in the incoming arrivals of a particular kind of data and receive communication of the occurrences of these events. In [2, 3] we introduce a process calculus L, based on the Linda coordination model, and we prove that if processes are synchronous with the dataspace (ordered interpretation) L is Turing powerful, while this is not the case if they are asynchronous (unordered interpretation). Here, we introduce a new calculus Ln , obtained by extending L with the event noti cation mechanism, and we prove two main results contrasting with what has been shown for L: (i) Ln is Turing powerful also under the unordered interpretation and (ii) it allows a faithful encoding of the ordered semantics on top of the unordered one.

The Vesta Approach to Software Configuration Management Vesta is a system for software configuration management. It stores collections of source files, keeps track of which versions of which files go together, and automates the process of building a complete software artifact from its component pieces. Vesta's novel approach gives it three important properties. First, every build is repeatable, because its component sources and build tools are stored immutably and immortally, and its configuration description completely specifies what components and tools are used and how they are put together. Second, every build is incremental, because results of previous builds are cached and reused. Third, every build is consistent, because all build dependencies are automatically captured and recorded, so that a cached result from a previous build is reused only when doing so is certain to be correct. In addition, Vesta's flexible language for writing configuration descriptions makes it easy to describe large software configurations in a modular fashion and to create variant configurations by customizing build parameters. This paper gives a brief overview of Vesta, outlining Vesta's advantages over traditional tools, how those benefits are achieved, and the system's overall performance.

Location and Recovery of Text on Oriented Surfaces We present a method for extracting text from images where the text plane is not necessarily fronto-parallel to the camera. Initially, we locate local image features such as borders and page edges. We then use perceptual grouping on these features to find rectangular regions in the scene. These regions are hypothesised to be pages or planes that may contain text. Edge distributions are then used for the assessment of these potential regions, providing a measure of confidence. It will be shown that the text may then be transformed to a fronto-parallel view suitable, for example, for an OCR system or other higher level recognition. The proposed method is scale independent (of the size of the text). We illustrate the algorithm using various examples.  Keywords: Oriented Text, Perspective Recovery of Text, Edge Angle Distribution  1.

A Business Process Agent The architecture of a process agent is a three-layer  BDI, hybrid, multi-agent architecture. These process  agents are intended to deal with corporate  cultural, or political, sensitivities as well as with  corporate rules. These agents adapt their behaviour  on the basis of the likelihood of plan success, and  on estimates of the time, cost and value of choosing  a plan.  1 Introduction  An intelligent multi-agent system is a society of autonomous cooperating components each of which maintains an ongoing interaction with its environment. Intelligent agents should be autonomous, cooperative and adaptive. A process agent architecture is designed specifically for business process applications. Typically the cost of bringing a business process to its conclusion is substantially due to the cost of the human processing involved. If this is so then a process management system should make its decisions in a thorough and considered way, and should have no reason, based on cost, for not doing s...

Probabilistic Affine Invariants for Recognition Under a weak perspective camera model, the image plane coordinates in different views of a planar object are related by an affine transformation. Because of this property, researchers have attempted to use affine invariants for recognition. However, there are two problems with this approach: (1) objects or object classes with inherent variability cannot be adequately treated using invariants; and (2) in practice the calculated affine invariants can be quite sensitive to errors in the image plane measurements. In this paper we use probability distributions to address both of these difficulties. Under the assumption that the feature positions of a planar object can be modeled using a jointly Gaussian density, we have derived the joint density over the corresponding set of affine coordinates. Even when the assumptions of a planar object and a weak perspective camera model do not strictly hold, the results are useful because deviations from the ideal can be treated as deformability in the ...

Parameter Control Using the Agent Based Patchwork Model The setting of parameters in Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) has crucial influence on their performance. Typically, the best choice depends on the optimization task. Some parameters yield better results when they are varied during the run. Recently, the so-called TerrainBased Genetic Algorithm (TBGA) was introduced, which is a self-tuning version of the traditional Cellular Genetic Algorithm (CGA). In a TBGA, the individuals of the population are placed in a two-dimensional grid, where only neighbored individuals can mate with each other. The position of an individual in this grid is interpreted as its offspring 's specific mutation rate and number of crossover points. This approach allows to apply GA parameters that are optimal for (i) the type of optimization task and (ii) the current state of the optimization process. However, only a few individuals can apply the optimal parameters simultaneously due to their fixed position in the grid lattice. In this paper, we substituted the fixed s...

Coordinating Mobile Agents by means of Communicators This paper proposes a coordination model, for both static and mobile agents, based on abstract structures called Communicators, entities which handle agent dialogue performed through ACL speech act exchanging. Such structures are designed based on a need to model agent dialogue in a human-like style, offering a set of coordination primitives of general validity, able to provide both a direct and indirect interaction model. Since a Communicator handles messages exchanged within a well-defined multi-agent application, it is fully programmable, i.e. it is possible to specify what messages can be exchanged and how these message have to be handled. In detail, a Communicator performs a syntactic and semantic routing, allowing the exchange and forwarding of a message according to the programmed coordination laws.

Annotate - A Web-based Knowledge Management Support System for Document Collections Difficulties with web-based full text information retrieval (IR) systems include spurious matches, manually intensive document sifting, and the absence of communication or coordination between users. Furthermore, it is not clear how to best design a Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) system which possesses coordination mechanisms in the inherently stateless Web environment. Document collections in an Intranet are a particularly interesting problem; electronic documents contain the potential for improving information throughput and knowledge transfer in organizations.

Architectural Design Patterns for Multiagent Coordination This paper presents our first step towards agent-oriented software engineering, focusing on the area of coordinated multi-agent systems. In multi-agent systems, the interactions between the agents are crucial in determining the effectiveness of the system. Hence the adoption of an appropriate coordination mechanism is pivotal in the design of multi-agent system architectures. This paper does not focus on agent theory, rather on the development of an agent-oriented software engineering methodology, collaboration architectures and design patterns for collaboration. A catalog of coordination patterns inherent in multi-agent architectures is presented. Such patterns may be utilized in the architectural design for multiagent systems, allowing researchers and practitioners to improve the integrability and reusability properties of their systems.

In our research, an attribute grammar is used to specify classes of neural network structures with explicit representation of their functional organization. These representations provide useful constraints upon a genetic optimization that guarantee the preservation of syntactically correct genetic trees with semantically meaningful sub-trees.

Seeking a Foundation for Context-Aware Computing Context-aware computing is generally associated with elements of the Ubiquitous Computing program, and the opportunity to distribute computation and interaction through the environment rather than concentrating it at the desktop computer. However, issues of context have also been important in other areas of HCI research. I argue that the scope of context-based computing should be extended to include not only Ubiquitous Computing, but also recent trends in tangible interfaces as well as work on sociological investigations of the organization of interactive behavior. By taking a view of contextaware computing that integrates these different perspectives, we can begin to understand the foundational relationships that tie them all together, and that provide a framework for understanding the basic principles behind these various forms of embodied interaction. In particular, I point to phenomenology as a basis for the development of a new framework for design and evaluation of context-aware ...

Co-operative Evaluation of a Desktop Virtual Reality System A summative usability evaluation of a desktop virtual reality (VR) system was developed and a preliminary study then conducted. The purpose of the study was twofold. Firstly, to test whether the traditional evaluation technique, co-operative evaluation, is effective in the evaluation of desktop VR systems. Co-operative evaluation is a variation on a `think-aloud' verbal protocol, whereby, in addition to concurrently 'thinking-aloud', users are encouraged to ask any questions about an evaluation, relating to the computer-based system, the application, or the tasks that they are required to perform during the evaluation. As well as this, the evaluator may ask questions of the user at any time during the evaluation. Results from the study indicate that this additional probing technique enables an evaluator to elicit further usability problems that may not have otherwise been exteriorized by the user. Additionally, a method is developed which attempts to turn round the qualitative 'think-aloud' type data into quantitative data. This provides a way of evaluating empirical 'think-aloud' evaluation methods and will be useful for comparing their effectiveness to evaluate 3D virtual reality systems.

Stochastic Attribute Selection Committees Classifier committee learning methods generate multiple classifiers to form a committee by repeated application of a single base learning algorithm. The committee members vote to decide the final classification. Two such methods, Bagging and Boosting, have shown great success with decision tree learning. They create different classifiers by modifying the distribution of the training set. This paper studies a different approach: Stochastic Attribute Selection Committee learning of decision trees. It generates classifier committees by stochastically modifying the set of attributes but keeping the distribution of the training set unchanged. An empirical evaluation of a variant of this method, namely Sasc, in a representative collection of natural domains shows that the SASC method can significantly reduce the error rate of decision tree learning. On average Sasc is more accurate than Bagging and less accurate than Boosting, although a one-tailed sign-test fails to show that these differences are significant at a level of 0.05. In addition, it is found that, like Bagging, Sasc is more stable than Boosting in terms of less frequently obtaining significantly higher error rates than C4.5 and, when error is raised, producing lower error rate increases. Moreover, like Bagging, Sasc is amenable to parallel and distributed processing while Boosting is not.

Evolution and Development of a Central Pattern Generator for the Swimming of a Lamprey This paper describes the design of neural control architectures for locomotion using an evolutionary approach. Inspired by the central pattern generators found in animals, we develop neural controllers which can produce the patterns of oscillations necessary for the swimming of a simulated lamprey. This work is inspired by Ekeberg's neuronal and mechanical model of a lamprey [11], and follows experiments in which swimming controllers were evolved using a simple encoding scheme [26, 25]. Here, controllers are developed using an evolutionary algorithm based on the SGOCE encoding [31, 32] in which a genetic programming approach is used to evolve developmental programs which encode the growing of a dynamical neural network. The developmental programs determine how neurons located on a 2D substrate produce new cells through cellular division and how they form efferent or afferent interconnections. Swimming controllers are generated when the growing networks eventually create connections to ...

Detecting Concept Drift with Support Vector Machines For many learning tasks where data is collected over an extended period of time, its underlying distribution is likely to change. A typical example is information filtering, i.e. the adaptive classification of documents with respect to a particular user interest. Both the interest of the user and the document content change over time. A filtering system should be able to adapt to such concept changes. This paper proposes a new method to recognize and handle concept changes with support vector machines. The method maintains a window on the training data. The key idea is to automatically adjust the window size so that the estimated generalization error is minimized. The new approach is both theoretically well-founded as well as effective and efficient in practice. Since it does not require complicated parameterization, it is simpler to use and more robust than comparable heuristics. Experiments with simulated concept drift scenarios based on real-world text data com...

A Multiagent Framework for Planning, Reacting, and Learning .  There are two main approaches to activity coordination in multiagent systems, plan-based coordination and reactive coordination, each having its specic advantages and disadvantages. This paper describes a framework called M-Dyna-Q that aims at combining these two approaches such that their advantages are retained while their disadvantages are avoided. The key idea behind M-Dyna-Q, which is a multiagent variant of a single-agent framework known as Dyna-Q, is to achieve this combination through equipping the agents with the capability to learn information that is relevant to their planning and reacting activities. M-Dyna-Q thus oers an integrated view of planning, reacting, and learning in multiagent systems.  Keywords.

User Modeling in Human-Computer Interaction A fundamental objective of human-computer interaction research is to make systems more usable, more useful, and to provide users with experiences fitting their specific background knowledge and objectives. The challenge in an information-rich world is not only to make information available to people at any time, at any place, and in any form, but specifically to say the right thing at the right time in the right way. Designers of collaborative humancomputer systems face the formidable task of writing software for millions of users (at design time) while making it work as if it were designed for each individual user (only known at use time). User modeling research has attempted to address these issues. In this article, I will first review the objectives, progress, and unfulfilled hopes that have occurred over the last ten years, and illustrate them with some interesting computational environments and their underlying conceptual frameworks.

Progressive KNN Search Using B+-trees In high-dimensional databases, nearest neighbor (NN) search is computationally expensive. However, for many applications where small errors can be tolerated, determining approximate answers quickly has become an acceptable alternative. In this paper, we present a new algorithm that exploits the iMinMax( ) scheme [16] to facilitate nearest neighbor processing. The proposed algorithm distinguishes itself from existing algorithms in two ways. First, it evaluates KNN queries progressively, i.e., it begins by examining a small amount of data to produce approximate answers quickly; as more data are examined, the approximate answers are refined. Second, unlike existing progressive algorithms that access data randomly, the algorithm searches the data space in a systematic and `optimal' manner. Our performance study shows that the proposed scheme can produce approximate answers very quickly. More importantly, the quality of the answers are not sacrified significantly. Such an extension is applicable to other relevant methods such as the Pyramid Technique[2].

CABOB: A Fast Optimal Algorithm for Combinatorial Auctions Combinatorial auctions where bidders can bid  on bundles of items can lead to more economical  allocations, but determining the winners is  NP-complete and inapproximable. We present  CABOB, a sophisticated search algorithm for  the problem. It uses decomposition techniques,  upper and lower bounding (also across components)  , elaborate and dynamically chosen bid ordering  heuristics, and a host of structural observations.  Experiments against CPLEX 7.0 show that  CABOB is usually faster, never drastically slower,  and in many cases with special structure, drastically  faster. We also uncover interesting aspects of  the problem itself. First, the problems with short  bids that were hard for the first-generation of specialized  algorithms are easy. Second, almost all of  the CATS distributions are easy, and become easier  with more bids. Third, we test a number of random  restart strategies, and show that they do not help on  this problem because the run-time distribution does  not have a heavy tail (at least not for CABOB).  1

A New Heuristic for Optimizing Large Queries There is a number of OODB optimization techniques proposed recently, such as the translation of path expressions into joins and query unnesting, that may generate a large number of implicit joins even for simple queries. Unfortunately, most current commercial query optimizers are still based on the dynamic programming approach of System R, and cannot handle queries of more than ten tables. There is a number of recent proposals that advocate the use of combinatorial optimization techniques, such as iterative improvement and simulated annealing, to deal with the complexity of this problem. These techniques, though, fail to take advantage of the rich semantic information inherent in the query specification, such as the information available in query graphs, which gives a good handle to choose which relations to join each time. This paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm that generates a good quality order of relational joins. It can also be used with minor modifications to sort OODB a...

Coordinated Reinforcement Learning We present several new algorithms for multiagent  reinforcement learning. A common feature of these  algorithms is a parameterized, structured representation  of a policy or value function. This structure  is leveraged in an approach we call coordinated reinforcement   learning, by which agents coordinate  both their action selection activities and their parameter  updates. Within the limits of our parametric  representations, the agents will determine  a jointly optimal action without explicitly considering  every possible action in their exponentially  large joint action space. Our methods differ from  many previous reinforcement learning approaches  to multiagent coordination in that structured communication  and coordination between agents appears  at the core of both the learning algorithm and  the execution architecture. Our experimental results,  comparing our approach to other RL methods,  illustrate both the quality of the policies obtained  and the additional benefits of coordination.

An Experimental Comparison of Localization Methods Localization is the process of updating the pose of a robot in an environment, based on sensor readings. In this experimental study, we compare two recent methods for localization of indoor mobile robots: Markov localization, which uses a probability distribution across a grid of robot poses; and scan matching, which uses Kalman filtering techniques based on matching sensor scans. Both these techniques are dense matching methods, that is, they match dense sets of environment features to an a priori map. To arrive at results for a range of situations, we utilize several different types of environments, and add noise to both the dead-reckoning and the sensors. Analysis shows that, roughly, the scan-matching techniques are more efficient and accurate, but Markov localization is better able to cope with large amounts of noise. These results suggest hybrid methods that are efficient, accurate and robust to noise.  1. Introduction  To carry out tasks, such as delivering objects, an indoor ro...

A Highly Adaptable Infrastructure for Service Discovery and Management in Ubiquitous Computing In an age where wirelessly networked appliances and devices are becoming commonplace, there is a necessity for providing a standard interface to them that is easily accessible by any mobile user. The design outlined in this paper provides an infrastructure and communication protocol for presenting services to heterogeneous mobile clients in a physical space via some short range wireless links. This system uses a Communication Manager to communicate with the client devices. The Communication Manager can be modified easily to work with any type of communication medium, including TCP/IP, Infrared, CDPD and Bluetooth. All the components in our model use a language based on Extensible Markup Language (XML) giving it a uniform and easily adaptable interface. We explain our trade-offs in implementation and through experiments we show that the design is feasible and that it indeed provides a flexible structure for providing services.

Searching the Web: General and Scientific Information Access he World Wide Web is revolutionizing the way people access information, and has opened up new possibilities in areas such as digital libraries, general and scientific information dissemination and retrieval, education, commerce, entertainment, government, and health care. The amount of publicly available information on the Web is increasing rapidly [1]. The Web is a gigantic digital library, a searchable 15 billion word encyclopedia [2]. It has stimulated research and development in information retrieval and dissemination, and fostered search engines such as AltaVista. These new developments are not limited to the Web, and can enhance access to virtually all forms of digital libraries. The revolution the Web has brought to information access is not so much due to the availability of information (huge amounts of information has long been available in libraries and elsewhere), but rather the increased efficiency of accessing information, which can make previously impractical tasks practical. There are many avenues for improvement in the efficiency of accessing information on the Web, for example, in the areas of locating and organizing information. This article discusses general and scientific information access on the Web, and many of our comments are applicable to digital libraries in general. The effectiveness of Web search engines is discussed, including results that show that the major search engines cover only a fraction of the ‚Äúpublicly indexable Web ‚Äù (the part of the Web which is considered for indexing by the major engines, which excludes pages hidden behind search forms, pages with authorization requirements, etc.).

Potter's Wheel: An Interactive Data Cleaning System Cleaning data of errors in structure and content is important  for data warehousing and integration. Current  solutions for data cleaning involve many iterations of  data "auditing" to find errors, and long-running transformations  to fix them. Users need to endure long  waits, and often write complex transformation scripts.  We present Potter's Wheel, an interactive data cleaning  system that tightly integrates transformation and  discrepancy detection. Users gradually build transformations  to clean the data by adding or undoing  transforms on a spreadsheet-like interface; the effect  of a transform is shown at once on records visible on  screen. These transforms are specified either through  simple graphical operations, or by showing the desired  effects on example data values. In the background,  Potter's Wheel automatically infers structures  for data values in terms of user-defined domains, and  accordingly checks for constraint violations. Thus  users can gradually build a transformation as discrepancies  are found, and clean the data without writing  complex programs or enduring long delays.  1

The Use Of Artificial Intelligence To Improve The Numerical Optimization Of Complex Engineering Designs Gradient-based numerical optimization of complex engineering designs promises to produce better designs rapidly. However, such methods generally assume that the objective function and constraint functions are continuous, smooth, and defined everywhere. Unfortunately, realistic simulators tend to violate these assumptions. We present several artificial intelligence-based techniques for improving the numerical optimization of complex engineering designs in the presence of such pathologies in the simulators. We have tested the resulting system in several realistic engineering domains, and have found that using our techniques can greatly decrease the cost of design space search, and can also increase the quality of the resulting designs.

A Statistical Method for Estimating the Usefulness of Text Databases Searching desired data in the Internet is one of the most common ways the Internet is used. No single  search engine is capable of searching all data in the Internet. The approach that provides an interface for  invoking multiple search engines for each user query has the potential to satisfy more users. When the  number of search engines under the interface is large, invoking all search engines for each query is often  not cost effective because it creates unnecessary network traffic by sending the query to a large number  of useless search engines and searching these useless search engines wastes local resources. The problem  can be overcome if the usefulness of every search engine with respect to each query can be predicted. In  this paper, we present a statistical method to estimate the usefulness of a search engine for any given  query. For a given query, the usefulness of a search engine in this paper is defined to be a combination of  the number of documents in the search engine that are sufficiently similar to the query and the average  similarity of these documents. Experimental results indicate that our estimation method is much more  accurate than existing methods.

An Integrated Vision Sensor for the Computation of Optical Flow Singular Points A robust, integrative algorithm is presented for computing the position of the focus of expansion or axis of rotation (the singular point) in optical flow fields such as those generated by self-motion. Measurements are shown of a fully parallel CMOS analog VLSI motion sensor array which computes the direction of local motion (sign of optical flow) at each pixel and can directly implement this algorithm. The flow field singular point is computed in real time with a power consumption of less than 2 mW . Computation of the singular point for more general flow fields requires measures of field expansion and rotation, which it is shown can also be computed in real-time hardware, again using only the sign of the optical flow field. These measures, along with the location of the singular point, provide robust real-time self-motion information for the visual guidance of a moving platform such as a robot. 1 INTRODUCTION  Visually guided navigation of autonomous vehicles requires robust measures...

Unlike similar systems which are limited to detecting upright, frontal faces, this system detects faces at any degree of rotation in the image plane.

We present the training methods for both types of networks. We also perform sensitivity analysis on the networks, and present empirical results on a large test set.

Natural-Sounding Speech Synthesis Using Variable-Length Units The goal of this work was to develop a speech synthesis system which concatenates variable-length units to create naturalsounding speech. Our initial work in this area showed that by careful design of system responses to ensure consistent intonation contours, natural-sounding speech synthesis was achievable with word- and phrase-level concatenation. In order to extend the flexibility of this framework, we focused on the problem of generating novel words from a corpus of sub-word units. The design of the sub-word units was motivated by perceptual studies that investigated where speech could be spliced with minimal audible distortion and what contextual constraints were necessary to maintain in order to produce natural sounding speech. The sub-word corpus is searched during synthesis using a Viterbi search which selects a sequence of units based on how well they individually match the input specification and on how well they sound as an ensemble.

Event Composition in Time-dependent Distributed Systems Many interesting application systems, ranging from workflow  management and CSCW to air traffic control, are eventdriven  and time-dependent and must interact with heterogeneous  components in the real world. Event services are used  to glue together distributed components. They assume a virtual  global time base to trigger actions and to order events.  The notion of a global time that is provided by synchronized  local clocks in distributed systems has a fundamental impact  on the semantics of event-driven systems, especially the composition  of events. The well studied 2g-precedence model,  which assumes that the granularity of global time-base g can  be derived from a priori known and bounded precision of  local clocks may not be suitable for the Internet where the  accuracy and external synchronization of local clocks is best  effort and cannot be guaranteed because of large transmission  delay variations and phases of disconnection. In this  paper we introduce a mechanism based on...

Incremental Computation and Maintenance of Temporal Aggregates Abstract. We consider the problems of computing aggregation queries in temporal databases and of maintaining materialized temporal aggregate views efficiently. The latter problem is particularly challenging since a single data update can cause aggregate results to change over the entire time line. We introduce a new index structure called the SB-tree, which incorporates features from both segment-trees and B-trees. SB-trees support fast lookup of aggregate results based on time and can be maintained efficiently when the data change. We extend the basicSB-tree index to handle cumulative (also called moving-window) aggregates, considering separately cases when the window size is or is not fixed in advance. For materialized aggregate views in a temporal database or warehouse, we propose building and maintaining SB-tree indices instead of the views themselves.

General Query Expansion Techniques For Spoken Document Retrieval This paper presents some developments in query expansion and document representation of our Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) system since the 1998 Text REtrieval Conference (TREC-7). We have shown that a modification of the document representation combining several techniques for query expansion can improve Average Precision by 17 % relative to a system similar to that which we presented at TREC-7 [1]. These new experiments have also confirmed that the degradation of Average Precision due to a Word Error Rate (WER) of 25 % is relatively small (around 2 % relative). We hope to repeat these experiments when larger document collections become available to evaluate the scalability of these techniques. 1.

Integrating Boosting and Stochastic Attribute Selection Committees for Further Improving the Performance of Decision Tree Learning Techniques for constructing classifier committees including Boosting and Bagging have demonstrated great success, especially Boosting for decision tree learning. This type of technique generates several classifiers to form a committee by repeated application of a single base learning algorithm. The committee members vote to decide the final classification. Boosting and Bagging create different classifiers by modifying the distribution of the training set. SASC (Stochastic Attribute Selection Committees) uses an alternative approach to generating classifier committees by stochastic manipulation of the set of attributes considered at each node during tree induction, but keeping the distribution of the training set unchanged. In this paper, we propose a method for improving the performance of Boosting. This technique combines Boosting and SASC. It builds classifier committees by manipulating both the distribution of the training set and the set of attributes available during induction. In...

Implicit Human Computer Interaction Through Context In this paper the term implicit human computer interaction is defined. It is discussed how the availability of processing power and advanced sensing technology can enable a shift in HCI from explicit interaction, such as direct manipulation GUIs, towards a more implicit interaction based on situational context. In the paper an algorithm that is based on a number of questions to identify applications that can facilitate implicit interaction is given. An XMLbased language to describe implicit HCI is proposed. The language uses contextual variables that can be grouped using different types of semantics as well as actions that are called by triggers. The term of perception is discussed and four basic approaches are identified that are useful when building context-aware applications. Providing two examples, a wearable context awareness component and a sensor-board, it is shown how sensor-based perception can be implemented. It is also discussed how situational context can be exploited to im...

Symbol Grounding: A New Look At An Old Idea Symbols should be grounded, as has been argued before. But we insist that they should be  grounded not only in subsymbolic activities, but also in the interaction between the agent and the  world. The point is that concepts are not formed in isolation (from the world), in abstraction, or  \objectively". They are formed in relation to the experience of agents, through their perceptual  /motor apparatuses, in their world and linked to their goals and actions.  In this paper, we will take a detailed look at this relatively old issue, using a new perspective,  aided by our new work of computational cognitive model development. To further our understanding,  we also go back in time to link up with earlier philosophical theories related to this issue. The  result is an account that extends from computational mechanisms to philosophical abstractions.  1  Symbol Grounding: A New Look At An Old Idea  Symbols should be grounded, as has been argued before.

Model Checking Multi-Agent Systems with MABLE MABLE is a language for the design and automatic verification of multi-agent systems. MABLE is essentially a conventional imperative programming language, enriched by constructs from the agent-oriented programming paradigm. A MABLE system contains a number of agents, programmed using the MABLE imperative programming language. Agents in MABLE have a mental state consisting of beliefs, desires and intentions. Agents communicate using request and inform performatives, in the style of the FIPA agent communication language. MABLE systems may be augmented by the addition of formal claims about the system, expressed using a quantified, linear temporal belief-desire-intention logic. MABLE has been fully implemented, and makes use of the SPIN model checker to automatically verify the truth or falsity of claims.

Using Category-Based Collaborative Filtering in the Active Webmuseum Collaborative filtering is an important technology for creating useradapting Web sites. In general the efforts of improving filtering algorithms and using the predictions for the presentation of filtered objects are decoupled. Therefore, common measures (or metrics) for evaluating collaborative filtering (recommender) systems focus mainly on the prediction algorithm. It is hard to relate the classic measurements to actual user satisfaction because of the way the  user interacts with the recommendations, determined by their representation,  influences the benefits for the user. We propose an abstract access paradigm, which can be applied to the design of filtering systems, and at the same time formalizes the access to filtering results via multi-corridors (based on content-based categories) . This leads to new measures which better relate to the user satisfaction. We use these measures to evaluate the use of various  kinds of multi-corridors for our prototype user-adapting Web site the: Active WebMuseum.

Secure Mobile Code: The JavaSeal experiment Mobile agents are programs that move between sites during execution to benefit from the services and information present at each site. To gain wide acceptance, strong security guarantees must be given: sites must be protected from malicious agents and agents must be protected from each other. Software based protection is widely viewed as the most efficient way of enforcing agent security. In the first part of the paper, we review programming language support for security. This review also helps to highlight weaknesses in the Java security model. In the second part of the paper, we make good on the lessons learned in the review to design a security architecture for the JavaSeal agent platform.  1 Introduction  Wide area networks such as the Internet hold the promise of a brave new wired world of global computing.

Automated Facial Expression Recognition Based on FACS Action Units Automated recognition of facial expression is an important addition to computer vision research because of its relevance to the study of psychological phenomena and the development of human-computer interaction (HCI). We developed a computer vision system that automatically recognizes individual action units or action unit combinations in the upper face using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). Our approach to facial expression recognition is based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which separates expressions into upper and lower face action. In this paper, we use three approaches to extract facial expression information: (1) facial feature point tracking, (2) dense flow tracking with principal component analysis (PCA), and (3) high gradient component detection (i.e., furrow detection). The recognition results of the upper face expressions using feature point tracking, dense flow tracking, and high gradient component detection are 85%, 93%, and 85%, respectively.  1.

Monotonic and Residuated Logic Programs In this paper we define the rather general framework of Monotonic Logic Programs, where the main results of (definite) logic programming are validly extrapolated. Whenever defining new logic programming extensions, we can thus turn our attention to the stipulation and study of its intuitive algebraic properties within the very general setting. Then, the existence of a minimum model and of a monotonic immediate consequences operator is guaranteed, and they are related as in classical logic programming. Afterwards we study the more restricted class of residuated logic programs which is able to capture several quite distinct logic programming semantics. Namely: Generalized Annotated Logic Programs, Fuzzy Logic Programming, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs, and Possibilistic Logic Programming. We provide the embedding of possibilistic logic programming.

Probabilistic Logic Programming with Conditional Constraints . We introduce a new approach to probabilistic logic programming in which probabilities are defined over a set of possible worlds. More precisely, classical program clauses are extended by a subinterval of [0; 1] that describes a range for the conditional probability of the head of a clause given its body. We then analyze the complexity of selected probabilistic logic programming tasks. It turns out that probabilistic logic programming is computationally more complex than classical logic programming. More precisely, the tractability of special cases of classical logic programming generally does not carry over to the corresponding special cases of probabilistic logic programming. Moreover, we also draw a precise picture of the complexity of deciding and computing tight logical consequences in probabilistic reasoning with conditional constraints in general. We then present linear optimization techniques for deciding satisfiability and computing tight logical consequences of probabilistic...

Learning Feed-Forward and Recurrent Fuzzy Systems: A Genetic Approach In this paper we present a new learning method for rule-based feed-forward and recurrent fuzzy systems. Recurrent fuzzy systems have hidden fuzzy variables and can approximate the temporal relation embedded in dynamic processes of unknown order. The learning method is universal i.e. it selects optimal width and position of Gaussian like membership functions and it selects a minimal set of fuzzy rules as well as the structure of the rules. A Genetic Algorithm is used to estimate the Fuzzy Systems which capture low complexity and minimal rule base. Optimization of the "entropy" of a fuzzy rule base leads to a minimal number of rules, of membership functions and of sub-premises together with an optimal input/output behavior. Most of the resulting Fuzzy Systems are comparable to systems designed by an expert but offers a better performance. The approach is compared to others by a standard benchmark (a system identification process). Different results for feed-forward and first order recurrent Fuzzy Systems with symmetric and non-symmetric membership functions are presented. Key words: Fuzzy logic controller, recurrent fuzzy systems, genetic algorithm, entropy of fuzzy rule, machine learning, dynamic processes. 1

Seeing the Whole in Parts: Text Summarization for Web Browsing on Handheld Devices We introduce five methods for summarizing parts of Web pages on handheld devices, such as personal digital assistants (PDAs), or cellular phones. Each Web page is broken into text units that can each be hidden, partially displayed, made fully visible, or summarized. The methods accomplish summarization by different means. One method extracts significant keywords from the text units, another attempts to find each text unit's most significant sentence to act as a summary for the unit. We use information retrieval techniques, which we adapt to the World-Wide Web context. We tested the relative performance of our five methods by asking human subjects to accomplish single-page information search tasks using each method. We found that the combination of keywords and single-sentence summaries provides significant improvements in access times and number of pen actions, as compared to other schemes.

Using the Cross-Entropy Method to Guide/Govern Mobile Agent's Path Finding in Networks The problem of finding paths in networks is general and many faceted with a wide range of engineering applications in communication networks. Finding the optimal path or combination of paths usually leads to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. A recent and promising method, the cross-entropy method proposed by Rubinstein, manages to produce optimal solutions to such problems in polynomial time. However this algorithm is centralized and batch oriented. In this paper we show how the cross-entropy method can be reformulated to govern the behaviour of multiple mobile agents which act independently and asynchronously of each other. The new algorithm is evaluate on a set of well known Travelling Salesman Problems. A simulator, based on the Network Simulator package, has been implemented which provide realistic simulation environments. Results show good performance and stable convergence towards near optimal solution of the problems tested.

Qualitative Velocity and Ball Interception Abstract. In many approaches for qualitative spatial reasoning, navigation of an agent in a more or less static environment is considered (e.g. in the double-cross calculus [12]). However, in general, real environment are dynamic, which means that both the agent itself and also other objects and agents in the environment may move. Thus, in order to perform spatial reasoning, not only (qualitative) distance and orientation information is needed (as e.g. in [1]), but also information about (relative) velocity of objects (see e.g. [2]). Therefore, we will introduce concepts for qualitative and relative velocity: (quick) to left, neutral, (quick) to right. We investigate the usefulness of this approach in a case study, namely ball interception of simulated soccer agents in the RoboCup [10]. We compare a numerical approach where the interception point is computed exactly, a strategy based on reinforcement learning, a method with qualitative velocities developed in this paper, and the na√Øve method where the agent simply goes directly to the actual ball position. Key words: cognitive robotics; multiagent systems; spatial reasoning. 1

Searching the World Wide Web in Low-Connectivity Communities The Internet has the potential to deliver information to communities around the world that have no other information resources. High telephone and ISP fees- in combination with lowbandwidth connections- make it unaffordable for many people to browse the Web online. We are developing the TEK system to enable users to search the Web using only email. TEK stands for &quot;Time Equals Knowledge, &quot; since the user exchanges time (waiting for email) for knowledge. The system contains three components: 1) the client, which provides a graphical interface for the end user, 2) the server, which performs the searches from MIT, and 3) a reliable email-based communication protocol between the client and the server. The TEK search engine differs from others in that it is designed to return low-bandwidth results, which are achieved by special filtering, analysis, and compression on the server side. We believe that TEK will bring Web resources to people who otherwise would not be able to afford them.

Constructive Theory Refinement in Knowledge Based Neural Networks Knowledge based artificial neural networks offer an approach for connectionist theory refinement. We present an algorithm for refining and extending the domain theory incorporated in a knowledge based neural network using constructive neural network learning algorithms. The initial domain theory comprising of propositional rules is translated into a knowledge based network of threshold logic units (TLU). The domain theory is modified by dynamically adding neurons to the existing network. A constructive neural network learning algorithm is used to add and train these additional neurons using a sequence of labeled examples. We propose a novel hybrid constructive learning algorithm based on the Tiling and Pyramid constructive learning algorithms that allows knowledge based neural network to handle patterns with continuous valued attributes. Results of experiments on two non-trivial tasks (the ribosome binding site prediction and the financial advisor) show that our algorithm compares favo...

The Evolutionary Unfolding of Complexity   We analyze the population dynamics of a broad class of tness functions that exhibit epochal evolution -- a dynamical behavior, commonly observed in both natural and artificial evolutionary processes, in which long periods of stasis in an evolving population are punctuated by sudden bursts of change. Our approach -- statistical dynamics -- combines methods from both statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory in a way that offers an alternative to current "landscape" models of evolutionary optimization. We describe the population dynamics on the macroscopic level of tness classes or phenotype subbasins, while averaging out the genotypic variation that is consistent with a macroscopic state. Metastability in epochal evolution occurs solely at the macroscopic level of the fitness distribution. While a balance between selection and mutation maintains a quasistationary distribution of fitness, individuals diffuse randomly through selectively neutral subbasins in genotype space. Sudden innovations occur when, through this diffusion, a genotypic portal is discovered that connects to a new subbasin of higher fitness genotypes. In this way, we identify innovations with the unfolding and stabilization of a new dimension in the macroscopic state space. The architectural view of subbasins and portals in genotype space clarifies how frozen accidents and the resulting phenotypic constraints guide the evolution to higher complexity.

Consumer Eye Movement Patterns on Yellow Pages Advertising Process tracing data help understand how yellow pages advertisement characteristics influence consumer information processing behavior. A laboratory experiment collected eye movement data while consumers chose businesses from phone directories. Consumers scan listings in alphabetic order. Their scan is not exhaustive. As a result, some ads are never seen. Consumers noticed over 93% of the quarter page display ads but only 26% of the plain listings. Consumers perceived color ads before ads without color, noticed more color ads than non-color ads and viewed color ads 21% longer than equivalent ads without color. Users viewed 42% more bold listings than plain listings. Consumers spent 54% more time viewing ads they end up choosing which demonstrates the importance of attention on subsequent choice behavior.  1 INTRODUCTION  In 1992, yellow pages directories were a $9.4 billion dollar information services business that reached 98% of American households (Mangel 1992).

Easily Adding Animations to Interfaces Using Constraints Adding animation to interfaces is a very difficult task with  today's toolkits, even though there are many situations in which it would be useful and effective. The Amulet toolkit contains a new form of animation constraint that allows animations to be added to interfaces extremely easily without changing the logic of the application or the graphical objects themselves. An animation constraint detects changes to the value of the slot to which it is attached, and causes the slot to instead take on a series of values interpolated between the original and new values. The advantage over previous approaches is that animation constraints provide significantly better modularity and reuse. The programmer has independent control over the graphics to be animated, the start and end values of the animation, the path through value space, and the timing of the animation. Animations can be attached to any object, even existing widgets from the toolkit, and any type of value can be animated: scalars, ...

Progress Report on the Disjunctive Deductive Database System . dlv is a deductive database system, based on disjunctive logic programming, which offers front-ends to several advanced KR formalisms. The system has been developed since the end of 1996 at Technische Universitat Wien in an ongoing project funded by the Austrian Science Funds (FWF). Recent comparisons have shown that dlv is nowadays a state-of-the-art implementation of disjunctive logic programming. A major strength of dlv are its advanced knowledge modelling features. Its kernel language extends disjunctive logic programming by strong negation (a la Gelfond and Lifschitz) and integrity constraints; furthermore, front-ends for the database language SQL3 and for diagnostic reasoning are available. Suitable interfaces allow dlv users to utilize base relations which are stored in external commercial database systems. This paper provides an overview of the dlv system and describes recent advances in its implementation. In particular, the recent implementation of incremental techniques fo...

Optimization of Constrained Frequent Set Queries with 2-variable Constraints Currently, there is tremendous interest in providing ad-hoc mining capabilities in database management systems. As a first step towards this goal, in [15] we proposed an architecture for supporting constraint-based, human-centered, exploratory mining of various kinds of rules including associations, introduced the notion of constrained frequent set queries (CFQs), and developed effective pruning optimizations for CFQs with 1-variable (1-var) constraints. While 1-var constraints are useful for constraining the antecedent and consequent separately, many natural examples of CFQs illustrate the need for constraining the antecedent and consequent jointly, for which 2-variable (2-var) constraints are indispensable. Developing pruning optimizations for CFQs with 2-var constraints is the subject of this paper. But this is a difficult problem because: (i) in 2var constraints, both variables keep changing and, unlike 1-var constraints, there is no fixed target for pruning; (ii) as we show, "conv...

A Unifying Information-theoretic Framework for Independent Component Analysis We show that different theories recently proposed for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) lead to the same iterative learning algorithm for blind separation of mixed independent sources. We review those theories and suggest that information theory can be used to unify several lines of research. Pearlmutter and Parra (1996) and Cardoso (1997) showed that the infomax approach of Bell and Sejnowski (1995) and the maximum likelihood estimation approach are equivalent. We show that negentropy maximization also has equivalent properties and therefore all three approaches yield the same learning rule for a fixed nonlinearity. Girolami and Fyfe (1997a) have shown that the nonlinear Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm of Karhunen and Joutsensalo (1994) and Oja (1997) can also be viewed from information-theoretic principles since it minimizes the sum of squares of the fourth-order marginal cumulants and therefore approximately minimizes the mutual information (Comon, 1994).

Extending Multi-Agent Cooperation by Overhearing Much cooperation among humans happens following a common pattern:  by chance or deliberately, a person overhears a conversation between  two or more parties and steps in to help, for instance by suggesting answers  to questions, by volunteering to perform actions, by making observations  or adding information. We describe an abstract architecture to support a  similar pattern in societies of articial agents. Our architecture involves  pairs of so-called service agents (or services) engaged in some tasks, and  unlimited number of suggestive agents (or suggesters). The latter have  an understanding of the work behaviors of the former through a publicly  available model, and are able to observe the messages they exchange. Depending  on their own objectives, the understanding they have available,  and the observed communication, the suggesters try to cooperate with  the services, by initiating assisting actions, and by sending suggestions to  the services. These in eect may induce a change in services behavior.  To test our architecture, we developed an experimental, multi-agent Web  site. The system has been implemented by using a BDI toolkit, JACK  Intelligent Agents.  Keywords: autonomous agents, multiagent systems, AI architectures, distributed AI.  1

A Probabilistic Framework for Matching Temporal Trajectories: Condensation-Based Recognition of Gestures and Expressions . The recognition of human gestures and facial expressions in image sequences is an important and challenging problem that enables a host of human-computer interaction applications. This paper describes a framework for incremental recognition of human motion that extends the "Condensation" algorithm proposed by Isard and Blake (ECCV'96). Human motions are modeled as temporal trajectories of some estimated parameters over time. The Condensation algorithm uses random sampling techniques to incrementally match the trajectory models to the multi-variate input data. The recognition framework is demonstrated with two examples. The first example involves an augmented office whiteboard with which a user can make simple hand gestures to grab regions of the board, print them, save them, etc. The second example illustrates the recognition of human facial expressions using the estimated parameters of a learned model of mouth motion. 1 Introduction Motion is intimately tied with our behavior; we m...

Fully Embodied Conversational Avatars: Making Communicative Behaviors Autonomous : Although avatars may resemble communicative interface agents, they have for the most part not profited from recent research into autonomous embodied conversational systems. In particular, even though avatars function within conversational environments (for example, chat or games), and even though they often resemble humans (with a head, hands, and a body) they are incapable of representing the kinds of knowledge that humans have about how to use the body during communication. Humans, however, do make extensive use of the visual channel for interaction management where many subtle and even involuntary cues are read from stance, gaze and gesture. We argue that the modeling and animation of such fundamental behavior is crucial for the credibility and effectiveness of the virtual interaction in chat. By treating the avatar as a communicative agent, we propose a method to automate the animation of important communicative behavior, deriving from work in conversation and discourse theory. B...

Partial Models of Extended Generalized Logic Programs . In recent years there has been an increasing interest in extensions  of the logic programming paradigm beyond the class of normal  logic programs motivated by the need for a satisfactory respresentation  and processing of knowledge. An important problem in this area is to find  an adequate declarative semantics for logic programs. In the present paper  a general preference criterion is proposed that selects the `intended'  partial models of extended generalized logic programs which is a conservative  extension of the stationary semantics for normal logic programs  of [13], [15] and generalizes the WFSX-semantics of [12]. The presented  preference criterion defines a partial model of an extended generalized  logic program as intended if it is generated by a stationary chain. The  GWFSX-semantics is defined by the set-theoretical intersection of all  stationary generated models, and thus generalizes the results from [9]  and [1].  1 Introduction  Declarative semantics provides a mathem...

Spatio-Temporal Data Types: An Approach to Modeling and Querying Moving Objects in Databases Spatio-temporal databases deal with geometries changing over time. In general, geometries cannot only change in discrete steps, but continuously, and we are talking about moving objects. If only the position in space of an object is relevant, then moving point is a basic abstraction; if also the extent is of interest, then the moving region abstraction captures moving as well as growing or shrinking regions. We propose a new line of research where moving points and moving regions are viewed as three-dimensional (2D space + time) or higher-dimensional entities whose structure and behavior is captured by modeling them as abstract data types. Such types can be integrated as base (attribute) data types into relational, object-oriented, or other DBMS data models; they can be implemented as data blades, cartridges, etc. for extensible DBMSs. We expect these spatio-temporal data types to play a similarly fundamental role for spatio-temporal databases as spatial data types have played for spatial databases. The paper explains the approach and discusses several fundamental issues and questions related to it that need to be clarified before delving into specific designs of spatio-temporal algebras.

Active Learning For Automatic Speech Recognition State-of-the-art speech recognition systems are trained using transcribed utterances, preparation of which is labor intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we describe a new method for reducing the transcription effort for training in automatic speech recognition (ASR). Active learning aims at reducing the number of training examples to be labeled by automatically processing the unlabeled examples, and then selecting the most informative ones with respect to a given cost function for a human to label. We automatically estimate a confidence score for each word of the utterance, exploiting the lattice output of a speech recognizer, which was trained on a small set of transcribed data. We compute utterance confidence scores based on these word confidence scores, then selectively sample the utterances to be transcribed using the utterance confidence scores. In our experiments, we show that we reduce the amount of labeled data needed for a given word accuracy by 27%.

Processing of Spatiotemporal Queries in Image Databases Overlapping Linear Quadtrees is a structure suitable for storing consecutive raster images according to transaction time (a database of evolving images). This structure saves considerable space without sacrificing time performance in accessing every single image. Moreover, it can be used for answering efficiently window queries for a number of consecutive images (spatio-temporal queries). In this paper, we present three such temporal window queries: strict containment, border intersect and cover. Besides, based on a method of producing synthetic pairs of evolving images (random images with specified aggregation) we present empirical results on the I/O performance of these queries.

A Probabilistic Approach to Navigation in Hypertext One of the main unsolved problems confronting Hypertext is the navigation problem, namely the problem of having to know where you are in the database graph representing the structure of a Hypertext database, and knowing how to get to some other place you are searching for in the database graph. Previously we formalised a Hypertext database in terms of a directed graph whose nodes represent pages of information. The notion of a trail, which is a path in the database graph describing some logical association amongst the pages in the trail, is central to our model. We defined a Hypertext Query Language, HQL, over Hypertext databases and showed that in general the navigation problem, i.e. the problem of finding a trail that satisfies a HQL query (technically known as the model checking problem), is NPcomplete. Herein we present a preliminary investigation of using a probabilistic approach in order to enhance the efficiency of model checking. The flavour of our investigation is that if we h...

Vulnerability Testing of Software System Using Fault Injection We describe an approach for testing a software system for possible security flaws. Traditionally, security testing is done using penetration analysis and formal methods. Based on the observation that most security flaws are triggered due to a flawed interaction with the environment, we view the security testing problem as the problem of testing for the fault-tolerance properties of a software system. We consider each environment perturbation as a fault and the resulting security compromise a failure in the toleration of such faults. Our approach is based on the well known technique of fault-injection. Environment faults are injected into the system under test and system behavior observed. The failure to tolerate faults is an indicator of a potential security flaw in the system. An Environment-Application Interaction (EAI) fault model is proposed. EAI allows us to decide what faults to inject. Based on EAI, we present a security-flaw classification scheme. This scheme was used to classify 142 security flaws in a vulnerability database. This classification revealed that 91 % of the security flaws in the database are covered by the EAI model.

Design and Implementation of Bitmap Indices for Scientific Data Bitmap indices are efficient multi-dimensional index data structures for handling complex adhoc queries in read-mostly environments. They have been implemented in several commercial database systems but are only well suited for discrete attribute values which are very common in typical business applications. However, many scientific applications usually operate on floating point numbers and cannot take advantage of the optimisation techniques offered by current database solutions. We thus present a novel algorithm called GenericRangeEval for processing one-sided range queries over floating point values. In addition we present a cost model for predicting the performance of bitmap indices for high-dimensional search spaces. We verify our analytical results by a detailed experimental study and show that the presented bitmap evaluation algorithm scales well also for high-dimensional search spaces requiring only a fairly small index. Because of its simple arithmetic structure, the cost model could easily be integrated into a query optimiser for deciding whether the current multi-dimensional query shall be answered by means of a bitmap index or better by sequentially scanning the data values, without using an index at all.

Declarative Procedural Goals in Intelligent Agent Systems An important concept for intelligent agent systems is goals. Goals have two aspects: declarative (a description of the state sought), and procedural (a set of plans for achieving the goal). A declarative view of goals is necessary in order to reason about important properties of goals, while a procedural view of goals is necessary to ensure that goals can be achieved efficiently in dynamic environments. In this paper we propose a framework for goals which integrates both views. We discuss the requisite properties of goals and the link between the declarative and procedural aspects, then derive a formal semantics which has these properties. We present a high-level plan notation with goals and give its formal semantics. We then show how the use of declarative information permits reasoning (such as the detection and resolution of conflicts) to be performed on goals. 1

Providing Haptic 'Hints' to Automatic Motion Planners In this paper, we investigate methods for enabling a human operator and an automatic motion planner to cooperatively solve a motion planning query. Our work is motivated by our experience that automatic motion planners sometimes fail due to the difficulty of discovering `critical' configurations of the robot that are often naturally apparent to a human observer.  Our goal is to develop techniques by which the automatic planner can utilize (easily generated) user-input, and determine `natural' ways to inform the user of the progress made by the motion planner. We show that simple randomized techniques inspired by probabilistic roadmap methods are quite useful for transforming approximate, user-generated paths into collision-free paths, and describe an iterative transformation method which enables one to transform a solution for an easier version of the problem into a solution for the original problem. We also show that simple visualization techniques can provide meaningful representatio...

A Textual Case-Based Reasoning Framework for Knowledge Management Applications Knowledge management (KM) systems manipulate organizational  knowledge by storing and redistributing corporate memories that are acquired  from the organization's members. In this paper, we introduce a textual casebased  reasoning (TCBR) framework for KM systems that manipulates  organizational knowledge embedded in artifacts (e.g., best practices, alerts,  lessons learned). The TCBR approach acquires knowledge from human users  (via knowledge elicitation) and from text documents (via knowledge extraction)  using template-based information extraction methods, a subset of natural  language, and a domain ontology. Organizational knowledge is stored in a case  base and is distributed in the context of targeted processes (i.e., within external  distribution systems). The knowledge artifacts in the case base have to be  translated into the format of the external distribution systems. A domain  ontology supports knowledge elicitation and extraction, storage of knowledge  artifacts in a case base, and artifact translation.

A Gesture Based Interaction Technique for a Planning Tool for Construction and Design In this article we wish to show a method that goes beyond the established approaches of human-computer interaction. We first bring a serious critique of traditional interface types, showing their major drawbacks and limitations. Promising alternatives are offered by Virtual (or: immersive) Reality (VR) and by Augmented Reality (AR). The AR design strategy enables humans to behave in a nearly natural way. Natural interaction means human actions in the real world with other humans and/or with real world objects. Guided by the basic constraints of natural interaction, we derive a set of recommendations for the next generation of user interfaces: the Natural User Interface (NUI). Our approach to NUIs is discussed in the form of a general framework followed by a prototype. The prototype tool builds on video-based interaction and supports construction and plant layout. A first empirical evaluation is briefly presented.  1 Introduction  The introduction of computers in the work place has had ...

Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Deductive Databases and Logic . . . The integration of concepts from logic and deduction into databases and knowledge bases has created the field of deductive databases. Logic programming provides a powerful declarative language for accessing and maintaining knowledge in databases. Techniques from relational databases and automated deduction are useful for achieving efficient retrieval and reasoning in large knowledge bases. Thus, deductive databases can be used for building intelligent information systems.

Electronic Books in Digital Libraries 1  Electronic book is an application with a multimedia database of instructional resources, which include hyperlinked text, instructor's audio/video clips, slides, animation, still images, etc. as well as content-based information about these data, and metadata such as annotations, tags, and cross-referencing information. Electronic books in the Internet or on CDs today are not easy to learn from. We propose the use of a multimedia database of instructional resources in constructing and delivering multimedia lessons about topics in an electronic book. We introduce an electronic book data model containing (a) topic objects and (b) instructional resources, called instruction module objects, which are multimedia presentations possibly capturing real-life lectures of instructors. We use the notion of topic prerequisites for topics at different detail levels, to allow electronic book users to request/compose multimedia lessons about topics in the electronic book. We present automated construction of the "best" user-tailored lesson (as a multimedia presentation. 1.

Justification for Inclusion Dependency Normal Form Functional dependencies (FDs) and inclusion dependencies (INDs) are the most fundamental integrity constraints that arise in practice in relational databases. In this paper we address the issue of normalisation in the presence of FDs and INDs and in particular the semantic justification for Inclusion Dependency Normal Form (IDNF), a normal form which combines Boyce-Codd normal form with the restriction on the INDs that they be noncircular and keybased. We motivate and formalise three goals of database design in the presence of FDs and INDs: non interaction between FDs and INDs, elimination of redundancy and update anomalies, and preservation of entity integrity. We show that, as for FDs, in the presence of INDs being free of redundancy is equivalent to being free of update anomalies. Then, for each of these properties we derive equivalent syntactic conditions on the database design. Individually, each of these syntactic conditions is weaker than IDNF and the restriction that an FD not ...

However some five years after the word `agent' came into vogue in the popular computing press, it is perhaps time the efforts in this fledgling area are thoroughly evaluated with a view to refocusing future efforts. We do not pretend to have done this in this paper -- but we hope we have sown the first seeds towards a thorough first 5-year report of the software agents area. The paper contains some strong views not necessarily widely accepted by the agent community  1  . 1 Introduction  The main goal of this paper is to provide a brief perspective on the progress of software agents research.

Negotiation Protocols and Dialogue Games In a dynamic and open environment negotiation protocols cannot be known  beforehand. We propose a methodology for constructing exible negotiation  protocols based on joint actions and dialogue games. We view negotiation  as a combination of joint actions. Simple dialogue games that consist of  initiatives followed by responses function as `recipes for joint action' from  which larger interactions can be constructed coherently.  1 Introduction  Agent based software engineering is an active research area. One of its main challenges is to bridge theoretical models and practical applications. For example, there are many theoretical results on negotiation [11], but automated negotiation is still rare on the internet. Implementing negotiation protocols raises a number of practical questions. In particular, current negotiation systems are either closed or semi-closed. In closed and semi-closed environments, like in auctions, there is central control over the agents that can participate. In s...

The Order of Things: Activity-Centred Information Access This paper focuses on the representation and access of Web-based information, and how to make such a representation adapt to the activities or interests of individuals within a community of users. The heterogeneous mix of information on the Web restricts the coverage of traditional indexing techniques and so limits the power of search engines. In contrast to traditional methods, and in a way that extends collaborative filtering approaches, the path model centres representation on usage histories rather than content analysis. By putting activity at the centre of representation and not the periphery, the path model concentrates on the reader not the author and the browser not the site. We describe metrics of similarity based on the path model, and their application in a URL recommender tool and in visualising sets of URLs.

Dynamic CPU Scheduling with Imprecise Knowledge of Computation-Time : The majority of the studies conducted in scheduling real-time transactions mostly concentrate  on concurrency control protocols, while overlooking the CPU as being the primary resource.  Consequently, there are various techniques for scheduling the CPU in conventional time-critical systems;  meanwhile, there does not seem to be any technique that is adequately designed for scheduling  such a resource in Real-Time Database (RTDB) systems. In this paper, we construct an efficient CPU  scheduling scheme that minimizes the preemption rate in order to reduce the frequency by which synchronization  protocols must be invoked, along with their inherited performance degradation. In addition,  we also introduce a new timing model upon which the newly introduced scheduler is incorpo-  rated in order to utilize the system's imprecise knowledge of computation time estimates.  Keywords: CPU Scheduling, lowering-preemption, timeliness-functions, and imprecise computation  estimates.  1. INTRODUCTIO...

Optimizations of Rough Set Model . Rough set methodology is based on concept (set) approximations constructed  from available background knowledge represented in information systems [14]. In many  applications only partial knowledge about approximated concepts is given. Hence quite  often first a parametrized family of concept approximations is built and next by tuning of  the parameters the best, in a sense, approximation is chosen (see e.g. variable precision  rough set model [40]) in approximation spaces. In this paper we follow this approach in  generalized approximation spaces. We discuss rough set model based on approximation  spaces with uncertainty functions and rough inclusions. Both elements of approximation  space are parametrized and for the proper application of such model to a particular data set  it is necessary to make optimization of the parameters. We discuss basic properties of the  mentioned model and also strategies of parameters optimization. We also present different  notions of rough relations....

Optimization of User-Defined Functions in Distributed Object-Relational DBMS Full support of parallelism in object-relational database systems (ORDBMSs) is desired. The parallelization techniques developed for relational database systems are not adequate for ORDBMS because of the introduction of complex abstract data types and operations on ordered domains. In this paper, we consider a data stream paradigm and develop a query parallelization framework that exploits characteristics of user-defined functions in a ORDBMS during query optimization. By introducing the concept of windows and abstract data type orderings, we develop a novel approach for parallelizing user-defined functions in a distributed ORDBMS environment. The implementation issues in providing query services in ordered domains are also discussed. 1 Introduction As time goes by, more and more database vendors agree that Object-Relational DBMSs (ORDBMSs) are the future [23]. Though full support of parallel ORDBMS is expected, the techniques used to parallelize relational database systems are not ad...

Means-End Plan Recognition - Towards a Theory of Reactive Recognition This paper draws its inspiration from current work in reactive planning to guide plan recognition using "plans as recipes". The plan recognition process guided by such a library of plans is called means-end plan recognition. An extension of dynamic logic, called dynamic agent logic, is introduced to provide a formal semantics for means-end plan recognition and its counterpart, means-end plan execution. The operational semantics, given by algorithms for means-end plan recognition, are then related to the provability of formulas in the dynamic agent logic. This establishes the relative soundness and completeness of the algorithms with respect to a given library of plans. Some of the restrictive assumptions underlying means-end plan recognition are then relaxed to provide a theory of reactive recognition that allows for changes in the external world during the recognition process. Reactive recognition, when embedded with the mental attitudes of belief, desire, and intention, leads to a po...

Assessing Software Libraries by Browsing Similar Classes, Functions and Relationships Comparing and contrasting a set of software libraries is useful for reuse related activities such as selecting a library from among several candidates or porting an application from one library to another. The current state of the art in assessing libraries relies on qualitative methods. To reduce costs and/or assess a large collection of libraries, automation is necessary. Although there are tools that help a developer examine an individual library in terms of architecture, style, etc., we know of no tools that help the developer directly compare several libraries. With existing tools, the user must manually integrate the knowledge learned about each library. Automation to help developers directly compare and contrast libraries requires matching of similar components (such as classes and functions) across libraries. This is different than the traditional component retrieval problem in which components are returned that best match a user's query. Rather, we need to find those component...

Measuring Knowledge with Workflow Management Systems Expert knowledge is captured in the process design. In organisations knowledge becomes embedded in routines, processes, practices as well as norms and can be evaluated by decisions or actions to which it leads, for example measurable efficiencies, speed or quality gains. Knowledge develops over time, through experience that includes what we absorb from courses, books, and mentors as well as informal learning. In this paper we analyse workflow history and demonstrate that workflow management systems enable knowledge measurement. 1

Using Probabilistic Relational Models for Collaborative Filtering Recent projects in collaborative filtering and information filtering address the task of inferring user preference relationships for products or information. The data on which these inferences are based typically consists of pairs of people and items. The items may be information sources (such as web pages or newspaper articles) or products (such as books, software, movies or CDs). We are interested in making recommendations or predictions. Traditional approaches to the problem derive from classical algorithms in statistical pattern recognition and machine learning. The majority of these approaches assume a ‚Äùflat ‚Äù data representation for each object, and focus on a single dyadic relationship between the objects. In this paper, we examine a richer model that allows us to reason about many different relations at the same time. We build on the recent work on probabilistic relational models (PRMs), and describe how PRMs can be applied to the task of collaborative filtering. PRMs allow us to represent uncertainty about the existence of relationships in the model and allow the properties of an object to depend probabilistically both on other properties of that object and on properties of related objects. 1

Improving the search on the Internet by using WordNet and lexical operators A vast amount of information is available on the Internet, and naturally,  many information gathering tools have been developed. Search engines with  dijerent characteristics, such as Alta Vista, Lycos, Infoseek, and others are  available. However, there are inherent difficulties associated with the task of  retrieving information on the Internet: (1) the web information is diverse and  highly unstructured, (2) the size of information is large and it grows at an  exponential rate. While these two issues are profound and require long term  solutions, still it is possible to develop software around the search engines to  improve the quality of the information retrieved. In this paper we present a  natural language interface system to a search engine. The search improvement  achieved by our system is based on: (1) a query extension using WordNet and  (2) the use of new lexical operators that replace the classical boolean opera-  tors used by current search engines. Several tests have been performed using  the TIPSTER topics collection, provided at the 6lb Text Retrieval Conference  (TREC-6); the results obtained are presented and discussed.

Efficient Mining of Partial Periodic Patterns in Time Series Database Partial periodicity search, i.e., search for partial periodic patterns in time-series databases, is an interesting data mining problem. Previous studies on periodicity search mainly consider finding full periodic patterns, where every point in time contributes (precisely or approximately) to the periodicity. However, partial periodicity is very common in practice since it is more likely that only some of the time episodes may exhibit periodic patterns. We present several algorithms for efficient mining of partial periodic patterns, by exploring some interesting properties related to partial periodicity, such as the Apriori property and the max-subpattern hit set property, and by shared mining of multiple periods. The max-subpattern hit set property is a vital new property which allows us to derive the counts of all frequent patterns from a relatively small subset of patterns existing in the time series. We show that mining partial periodicity needs only two scans over the time series database, even for mining multiple periods. The performance study shows our proposed methods are very efficient in mining long periodic patterns.

Temporal View Self-Maintenance . View self-maintenance refers to maintaining materialized views without accessing base data. Self-maintenance is particularly useful in data warehousing settings, where base data comes from sources that may be inaccessible. Selfmaintenance has been studied for nontemporal views, but is even more important when a warehouse stores temporal views over the history of source data, since the source history needed to perform view maintenance may no longer exist. This paper tackles the self-maintenance problem for temporal views. We show how to derive auxiliary data to be stored at the warehouse so that the warehouse views and auxiliary data can be maintained without accessing the sources. The temporal view self-maintenance problem is considerably harder than the nontemporal case because a temporal view may need to be maintained not only when source data is modified but also as time advances, and these two dimensions of change interact in subtle ways. We also seek to minimize the amount of au...

Generative Models for Cold-Start Recommendations Systems for automatically recommending items (e.g., movies, products, or information) to users are becoming increasingly important in e-commerce applications, digital libraries, and other domains where personalization is highly valued. Such recommender systems typically base their suggestions on (1) collaborative data encoding which users like which items, and/or (2) content data describing item features and user demographics. Systems that rely solely on collaborative data fail when operating from a cold start---that is, when recommending items (e.g., first-run movies) that no member of the community has yet seen. We develop several generative probabilistic models that circumvent the cold-start problem by mixing content data with collaborative data in a sound statistical manner. We evaluate the algorithms using MovieLens movie ratings data, augmented with actor and director information from the Internet Movie Database. We find that maximum likelihood learning with the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm and variants tends to overfit complex models that are initialized randomly. However, by seeding parameters of the complex models with parameters learned in simpler models, we obtain greatly improved performance. We explore both methods that exploit a single type of content data (e.g., actors only) and methods that leverage multiple types of content data (e.g., both actors and directors) simultaneously.

What can you do with a Web in your Pocket? The amount of information available online has grown enormously over the past decade. Fortunately, computing power, disk capacity, and network bandwidth have also increased dramatically. It is currently possible for a university research project to store and process the entire World Wide Web. Since there is a limit on how much text humans can generate, it is plausible that within a few decades one will be able to store and process all the human-generated text on the Web in a shirt pocket. The Web is a very rich and interesting data source. In this paper, we describe the Stanford WebBase, a local repository of a significant portion of the Web. Furthermore, we describe a number of recent experiments that leverage the size and the diversity of the WebBase. First, we have largely automated the process of extracting a sizable relation of books (title, author pairs) from hundreds of data sources spread across the World Wide Web using a technique we call Dual Iterative Pattern Relation Extraction. Second, we have developed a global ranking of Web pages called PageRank based on the link structure of the Web that has properties that are useful for search and navigation. Third, we have used PageRank to develop a novel search engine called Google, which also makes heavy use of anchor text. All of these experiments rely significantly on the size and diversity of the WebBase. 1

An Incremental Interpreter for High-Level Programs with Sensing Like classical planning, the execution of high-level agent programs requires a reasoner to look all the way to a final goal state before even a single action can be taken in the world. This deferral is a serious problem in practice for large programs. Furthermore, the problem is compounded in the presence of sensing actions which provide necessary information, but only after they are executed in the world. To deal with this, we propose (characterize formally in the situation calculus, and implement in Prolog) a new incremental way of interpreting such high-level programs and a new high-level language construct, which together, and without loss of generality, allow much more control to be exercised over when actions can be executed. We argue that such a scheme is the only practical way to deal with large agent programs containing both nondeterminism and sensing.

A Social Semantics for Agent Communication Languages . The ability to communicate is one of the salient properties  of agents. Although a number of agent communication languages (ACLs)  have been developed, obtaining a suitable formal semantics for ACLs remains  one of the greatest challenges of multiagent systems theory. Previous  semantics have largely been mentalistic in their orientation and  are based solely on the beliefs and intentions of the participating agents.  Such semantics are not suitable for most multiagent applications, which  involve autonomous and heterogeneous agents, whose beliefs and intentions  cannot be uniformly determined. Accordingly, we present a social  semantics for ACLs that gives primacy to the interactions among the  agents. Our semantics is based on social commitments and is developed  in temporal logic. This semantics, because of its public orientation, is  essential to providing a rigorous basis for multiagent protocols.  1 Introduction  Interaction among agents is the distinguishing property of multia...

View-based Interpretation of Real-time Optical Flow for Gesture Recognition We have developed a real-time, view-based gesture recognition system. Optical flow is estimated and segmented into motion blobs. Gestures are recognized using a rule-based technique based on characteristics of the motion blobs such as relative motion and size. Parameters of the gesture (e.g., frequency) are then estimated using context specific techniques. The system has been applied to create an interactive environment for children. 1 Introduction  For many applications, the use of hand and body gestures is an attractive alternative to the cumbersome interface devices for human-computer interaction. This is especially true for interacting in virtual reality environments, where the user is no longer confined to the desktop and should be able to move around freely. While special devices can be worn to achieve these goals, these can be expensive and unwieldy. There has been a recent surge in computer vision research to provide a solution that doesn't use such devices. This paper describe...

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with the MAXQ Value Function Decomposition This paper presents a new approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning based on decomposing the target Markov decision process (MDP) into a hierarchy ofsmaller MDPs and decomposing the value function of the target MDP into an additive combination of the value functions of the smaller MDPs. The decomposition, known as the MAXQ decomposition, has both a procedural semantics|as a subroutine hierarchy|and a declarative semantics|as a representation of the value function of a hierarchical policy. MAXQ uni es and extends previous work on hierarchical reinforcement learning by Singh, Kaelbling, and Dayan and Hinton. It is based on the assumption that the programmer can identify useful subgoals and de ne subtasks that achieve these subgoals. By de ning such subgoals, the programmer constrains the set of policies that need to be considered during reinforcement learning. The MAXQ value function decomposition can represent the value function of any policy that is consistent with the given hierarchy. The decomposition also creates opportunities to exploit state abstractions, so that individual MDPs within the hierarchy can ignore large parts of the state space. This is important for the practical application of the

Agents That Talk Back (Sometimes): Filter Programs for Affective Communication This paper introduces a model of interaction between  users and animated agents as well as inter-agent interaction  that supports basic features of affective conversation. As essential requirements for animated agents' capability to engage in and exhibit affective communication  we motivate reasoning about emotion and emotion expression, personality, and social role awareness. The main contribution of our paper is the discussion of  so-called `filter programs' that may qualify an agent's expression of its emotional state by its personality and the social context. All of the mental concepts that determine  emotion expression, such as emotional state, personality, standards, and attitudes, have associated  intensities for fine-tuning the agent's reactions in user-adapted  environments.

Online Reconfiguration in Replicated Databases Based on Group Communication Use of group communication to support replication in database systems has proven to be an attractive alternative to traditional replica control schemes. And various replica control protocols have been developed that use the ordering and reliability semantics of group communication primitives to simplify database system design and to improve performance. Although current solutions are able to mask site failures effectively, they are unable to cope with recovery of failed sites, merging of partitions, or joining of new sites. This paper addresses this important issue and proposes efficient solutions for online system reconfiguration providing new sites with a current state of the database without interrupting transaction processing in the rest of the system. We present various alternatives that can match the needs of different operating environments. We analyze the implications of long and complex reconfigurations on applications such as replicated databases, and argue that their developement may be greatly simplified by extended forms of group communications.

3D Hand Pose Reconstruction Using Specialized Mappings A system for recovering 3D hand pose from monocular color sequences is proposed. The system employs a non-linear supervised learning framework, the specialized mappings architecture (SMA), to map image features to likely 3D hand poses. The SMA's fundamental components are a set of specialized forward mapping functions, and a single feedback matching function. The forward functions are estimated directly from training data, which in our case are examples of hand joint configurations and their corresponding visual features. The joint angle data in the training set is obtained via a CyberGlove, a glove with 22 sensors that monitor the angular motions of the palm and fingers. In training, the visual features are generated using a computer graphics module that renders the hand from arbitrary viewpoints given the 22 joint angles. The viewpoint is encoded by two real values, therefore 24 real values represent a hand pose. We test our system both on synthetic sequences and on sequences taken with a color camera. The system automatically detects and tracks both hands of the user, calculates the appropriate features, and estimates the 3D hand joint angles and viewpoint from those features. Results are encouraging given the complexity of the task.

Accurate and Fast Proximity Queries Between Polyhedra Using Convex Surface Decomposition The need to perform fast and accurate proximity queries arises frequently in physically-based modeling, simulation,  animation, real-time interaction within a virtual environment, and game dynamics. The set of proximity  queries include intersection detection, tolerance verification, exact and approximate minimum distance computation,  and (disjoint) contact determination. Specialized data structures and algorithms have often been designed  to perform each type of query separately. We present a unified approach to perform any of these queries seamlessly  for general, rigid polyhedral objects with boundary representations which are orientable 2-manifolds. The  proposed method involves a hierarchical data structure built upon a surface decomposition of the models. Furthermore,  the incremental query algorithm takes advantage of coherence between successive frames. It has been  applied to complex benchmarks and compares very favorably with earlier algorithms and systems.  1.

Hierarchical Discriminant Regression The main motivation of this paper is to propose a new classification and regression method for challenging high dimensional data. The proposed new technique casts classification problems (class labels as output) and regression problems (numeric values as output) into a unified regression problem. This unified view enables classification problems to use numeric information in the output space that is available for regression problems but are traditionally not readily available for classification problems -- distance metric among clustered class labels for coarse and fine classifications. A doubly clustered subspace-based hierarchical discriminating regression (HDR) method is proposed in this work. The major characteristics include: (1) Clustering is performed in both output space and input space at each internal node and thus the term "doubly clustered." Clustering in the output space provides virtual labels for computing clusters in the input space. (2) Discriminants in the input spa...

Hunting moving targets: an extension to Bayesian methods in multimedia databases It has been widely recognised that the difference between the level of abstraction of the formulation of a query (by example) and that of the desired result (usually an image with certain semantics) calls for the use of learning methods that try to bridge this gap. Cox et al. have proposed a Bayesian method to learn the user's preferences during each query.  Cox et al.'s system, PicHunter,  1  is designed for optimal performance when the user is searching for a fixed target image. The performance of the system was evaluated using target testing, which ranks systems according to the number of interaction steps required to find the target, leading to simple, easily reproducible experiments.  There are some aspects of image retrieval, however, which are not captured by this measure. In particular, the possibility of query drift (i.e. a moving target) is completely ignored. The algorithm proposed by Cox et al. does not cope well with a change of target at a late query stage, because it is ...

Similarity Measures With complex multimedia data, we see the emergence of database systems in which the fundamental operation is similarity assessment. Before database issues can be addressed, it is necessary to give a definition of similarity as an operation. In this paper we develop a similarity measure, based on fuzzy logic, that exhibit several features that match experimental findings in humans. The model is dubbed Fuzzy Feature Contrast (FFC) and is an extension to a more general domain of the Feature Contrast model due to Tversky. We show how the FFC model can be used to model similarity assessment from fuzzy judgment of properties, and we address the use of fuzzy measures to deal with dependencies among the properties. 1 Introduction  Comparing two images, or an image and a model, is the fundamental operation for many Visual Information Retrieval systems. In most systems of interest, a simple pixel-by-pixel comparison won't do: the difference that we determine must bear some correlation with the p...

A Novel Sensor for Dynamic Tactile Information We present a novel tactile sensor, which is useful for dextrous grasping with a simple robot gripper. The novel part consists of an array of capacitive sensors, which couple to the object by means of little brushes of fibers. These sensor elements are very sensitive (with a threshold of about 5 mN) but robust enough not to be damaged during grasping. They yield two types of dynamical tactile information corresponding roughly to two types of tactile sensors in the human skin. The complete sensor consists of a foil-based static force sensor, which yields the total force and the center of the two-dimensional force distribution and is surrounded by an array of the dynamical sensor elements. One such sensor has been mounted on each of the two gripper jaws of our humanoid robot and equipped with the necessary read-out electronics and a CAN bus interface. As first applications we describe experiments to evaluate the quality of a grip using the sensor measurements and a utility that allows to ...

Language Identification From Prosody Without Explicit Features Most current language identification (LID) systems make little or no use of prosodic information, despite the importance of prosody in LID by humans. The greatest obstacle has been that of finding an appropriate feature set which captures linguistically relevant prosodic information. The only system to attempt LID entirely on the basis of prosodic variables uses a set of over 200 features which are selected and combined in a task-specific manner [12]. We apply a novel recurrent neural network model to the task of pairwise discrimination among languages. Network inputs are limited to delta-F 0 and the first difference of the band limited amplitude envelope. Initial results are based on all pairwise combinations of English, German, Japanese, Mandarin and Spanish, with 90 speakers per language.

World Wide Web Information Retrieval Using Web Connectivity Information Gathering, processing and distributing information from the World Wide Web will be a vital technology for the next century. Web search techniques have played a critical role in the development of information systems. Due to the diverse nature of web documents, traditional search techniques must be improved. Hyperlink structure based methods have proved to be powerful ways of exploring the relationships between web documents. In this project, a prototype web search engine was developed to exploit the link structure of web documents, based on the use of the Companion algorithm. The prototype consists of a web spider, local database, and search software. The system was written using the Java programming language. Our spider crawls and downloads web pages using Lynx, then saves the hyperlinks into an Oracle database. JDBC is used to implement the database processing. Search software makes a vicinity graph for the query URL and returns the most related pages after calculating the hub and authority weights. Finally, HTML web pages provide user interfaces and communicate with CGI using the Perl language.  iii  ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The author would like to express thanks to all of the members of his M.S. committee for their useful comments on the thesis, assistance in scheduling the defense date and kind help during the final defense period.

A Process-Oriented Heuristic for Model Selection Current methods to avoid overfitting are either data-oriented (using separate data for validation) or representation-oriented (penalizing complexity in the model). This paper proposes process-oriented evaluation, where a model's expected generalization error is computed as a function of the search process that led to it. The paper develops the necessary theoretical framework, and applies it to one type of learning: rule induction. A process-oriented version of the CN2 rule learner is empirically compared with the default CN2. The process-oriented version is more accurate in a large majority of the datasets, with high significance, and also produces simpler models. Experiments in artificial domains suggest that processoriented evaluation is particularly useful in high-dimensional domains. 1 INTRODUCTION  Overfitting avoidance is often considered the central problem of machine learning (e.g., (Cheeseman & Oldford, 1994)). If a learner is sufficiently powerful, it must guard against selec...

L-Fuzzy Valued Inclusion Measure, L-Fuzzy Similarity and L-Fuzzy Distance The starting point of this paper is the introduction of a new measure of inclusion of fuzzy set A in fuzzy set B. Previously used inclusion measures take values in the interval [0,1]; the inclusion measure proposed here takes values in a Boolean lattice. In other words, inclusion is viewed as an Lfuzzy valued relation between fuzzy sets. This relation is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive, i.e. it is a fuzzy order relation; in addition it possesess a number of properties which various authors have postulated as axiomatically appropriate for an inclusion measure. We also define an L-fuzzy valued measure of similarity between fuzzy sets and and an L-fuzzy valued distance function between fuzzy sets; these possess properties analogous to the ones of real-valued similarity and distance functions. Keywords: Fuzzy Relations, inclusion measure, subsethood, L-fuzzy sets, similarity, distance, transitivity. 1

Modelling Rational Inquiry in Non-Ideal Agents The construction of rational agents is one of the goals that has been pursued in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In most of the architectures that have been proposed for this kind of agents, its behaviour is guided by its set of beliefs. In our work, rational agents are those systems that are permanently engaged in the process of rational inquiry; thus, their beliefs keep evolving in time, as a consequence of their internal inference procedures and their interaction with the environment. Both AI researchers and philosophers are interested in having a formal model of this process, and this is the main topic in our work. Beliefs have been formally modelled in the last decades using doxastic logics. The possible worlds model and its associated Kripke semantics provide an intuitive semantics for these logics, but they seem to commit us to model agents that are logically omniscient and perfect reasoners. We avoid these problems by replacing possible worlds by conceivable situations,  which ar...

Adaptive-FP: An Efficient And Effective Method For Multi-Level Multi-Dimensional Frequent Pattern Mining Real life transaction databases usually contain both item information and dimension information. Moreover, taxonomies about items likely exist. Knowledge about multilevel and multi-dimensional frequent patterns is interesting and useful. The classic frequent pattern mining algorithms based on a uniform minimum support, such as Apriori and FP-growth, either miss interesting patterns of low support or suffer from the bottleneck of itemset generation. Other frequent pattern mining algorithms, such as Adaptive Apriori, though taking various supports, focus mining at a single abstraction level. Furthermore, as an Apriori-based algorithm, the efficiency of Adaptive Apriori suffers from the multiple database scans. In this thesis, we extend FP-growth to attack the problem of multi-level multidimensional frequent pattern mining. We call our algorithm Ada-FP, which stands for Adaptive FP-growth. The efficiency of our Ada-FP is guaranteed by the high scalability of FP-growth. To increase the effectiveness, our Ada-FP pushes various support constraints into the mining process. First, item taxonomy has been explored. Our Ada-FP can discover both inter-level frequent patterns and intra-level frequent patterns. Second, in our Ada-FP, dimension information has been taken into account. We show that our Ada-FP is more flexible at capturing desired knowledge than previous studies.

We report here on an empirical investigation into emergent collaboration. We developed a webcrawling algorithm and tested its performance on topics volunteered by 30 subjects. Our findings include:  . Some topics exhibit emergent collaboration, some do not. The presence of commercial sites reduces collaboration.  . When sites are linked with other sites, they tend to group into one large, tightly connected component.  . Connectivity can serve as the basis for collaborative filtering.

Compact Fuzzy Models Through Complexity Reduction and Evolutionary Optimization Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and other evolutionary optimization  methods to design fuzzy rules from data for systems modeling and  classification have received much attention in recent literature.

Fuzzy clustering,  rule reduction, rule base simplification and constrained genetic optimization  are integrated in a data-driven modeling scheme with low human  intervention. Attractive models with respect to compactness, transparency  and accuracy, are the result of this symbiosis.  I. INTRODUCTION  We focus on learning fuzzy rules from data with low human intervention.

Autonomous Cyber Agents: Rules For Collaboration A cyber agent is any program, machine or person engaged in computer-enabled work. Thus, cyber agents can vary considerably in complexity and intelligence. Can they, despite their variety, be organized to collaborate effectively ? Both empirical evidence and theory suggest that they can. Moreover, there seem to be simple rules for designing problem-solving organizations in which collaboration among cyber agents is automatic and scale-effective (adding agents tends to improve solution-quality; adding computers tends to improve solution-speed). This paper develops some of these rules.  1.

Using Reinforcement Learning to Spider the Web Efficiently Consider the task of exploring the Web in order to find pages of a particular kind or on a particular topic. This task arises in the construction of search engines and Web knowledge bases. This paper argues that the creation of efficient web spiders is best framed and solved by reinforcement learning, a branch of machine learning that concerns itself with optimal sequential decision making. One strength of reinforcement learning is that it provides a formalism for measuring the utility of actions that give benefit only in the future. We present an algorithm for learning a value function that maps hyperlinks to future discounted reward by using naive Bayes text classifiers. Experiments on two real-world spidering tasks show a three-fold improvement in spidering efficiency over traditional breadth-first search, and up to a two-fold improvement over reinforcement learning with immediate reward only.

Using Case-Based Learning to Improve Genetic-Algorithm-Based Design Optimization In this paper we describe a method for improving genetic-algorithm-based optimization using case-based learning. The idea is to utilize the sequence of points explored during a search to guide further exploration. The proposed method is particularly suitable for continuous spaces with expensive evaluation functions, such as arise in engineering design. Empirical results in two engineering design domains and across different representations demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of the GA optimizer. Moreover, the results suggest that the modification makes the genetic algorithm less sensitive to poor choices of tuning parameters such as mutation rate. 1 Introduction  Genetic Algorithms (GAs) [ Goldberg 1989 ] are search algorithms that simulate the process of natural selection.

Antitonic Logic Programs We propose a framework which extends Antitonic Logic Programs [3] to an arbitrary complete bilattice of truth-values, where belief and doubt are explicitly represented. Based on Fitting's ideas, this framework allows a precise definition of important operators found in logic programming such as explicit negation and the default negation. In particular, it leads to a natural integration of explicit negation with the default negation through the coherence principle [20]. According to this principle, the explicit negation entails the default negation. We then define Coherent Answer Sets, and the Paraconsistent Well-founded Model semantics, generalizing paraconsistent semantics for logic programs (for instance, WFSXp [2]). Our framework is an extension of Antitonic Logic Programs in the most cases, and is general enough to capture Probabilistic Deductive Databases, Possibilistic Logic Programming, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs, and Fuzzy Logic Programming. Thus, we have a powerful mathematical formalism for dealing with default reasoning, paraconsistency, and uncertainty. We illustrate its adumbration of paraconsistency with an embedding of WFSXp into our framework.

Building a Public Digital Library Based on Full-Text Retrieval Digital libraries are expensive to create and maintain, and generally restricted  to a particular corporation or group of paying subscribers. While many indexes  to the World Wide Web are freely available, the quality of what is indexed is  extremely uneven. The digital analog of a public library---a reliable, quality,  community service---has yet to appear. This paper demonstrates the feasibility  of a cost-effective collection of high-quality public-domain information,  available free over the Internet.  One obstacle to the creation of a digital library is the difficulty of providing  formal cataloguing information. Without a title, author and subject database it  seems hard to offer the searching facilities normally available in physical  libraries. Full-text retrieval provides a way of approximating these services  without a concomitant investment of resources. A second is the problem of  finding a suitable corpus of material.

We conjecture that such concepts are grounded in a type of information processing architecture, and not simply in observable behaviour nor in Newell's knowledge-level concepts, nor Dennett's "intentional stance."

Independent Component Analysis: A flexible non-linearity and decorrelating manifold approach Independent Components Analysis finds a linear transformation to variables which are maximally statistically independent. We examine ICA and algorithms for finding the best transformation from the point of view of maximising the likelihood of the data. In particular, we discuss the way in which scaling of the unmixing matrix permits a "static" nonlinearity to adapt to various marginal densities. We demonstrate a new algorithm that uses generalised exponential functions to model the marginal densities and is able to separate densities with light tails. We characterise the manifold of decorrelating matrices and show that it lies along the ridges of high-likelihood unmixing matrices in the space of all unmixing matrices. We show how to find the optimum ICA matrix on the manifold of decorrelating matrices, and as an example use the algorithm to find independent component basis vectors for an ensemble of portraits. 1 Introduction  Finding a natural cooordinate system is an essential first s...

Ranking documents for user queries has also been at the heart of the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC in short) under the label ###### retrieval. The TREC community has developed document ranking algorithms that are known to be the best for searching the document collections used in TREC, which are mainly comprised of newswire text. However, the web search community has developed its own methods to rank web pages/sites, many of which use link structure on the web, and are quite dierentfrom  the algorithms developed at TREC.

The results from the TREC algorithms are compared to four commercial web search engines. Results show that for nding the web page/site of an entity, commercial web search engines are notably better than a state-of-the-art TREC algorithm.

A Hybrid Decision Tree/genetic Algorithm for Coping With the Problem of Small Disjuncts in Data Mining The problem of small disjuncts is a serious  challenge for data mining algorithms. In essence,  small disjuncts are rules covering a small  number of examples. Due to their nature, small  disjuncts tend to be error prone and contribute to  a decrease in predictive accuracy. This paper  proposes a hybrid decision tree/genetic algorithm  method to cope with the problem of small  disjuncts. The basic idea is that examples  belonging to large disjuncts are classified by  rules produced by a decision-tree algorithm,  while examples belonging to small disjuncts  (whose classification is considerably more  difficult) are classified by rules produced by a  genetic algorithm specifically designed for this  task.  1 INTRODUCTION  In the context of the well-known classification task of data mining, the discovered knowledge is often expressed as a set of IF-THEN rules, since this kind of knowledge representation is intuitive for the user.

Different approaches to induce cooperation in fuzzy linguistic models under the COR methodology Nowadays, Linguistic Modeling is considered to be one of the most important areas of application for Fuzzy Logic. It is accomplished by linguistic Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems, whose most interesting feature is the interpolative reasoning developed. This characteristic plays a key role in their high performance and is a consequence of the cooperation among the involved fuzzy rules. A new approach that makes good use of this aspect inducing cooperation among rules is introduced in this contribution: the Cooperative Rules methodology. One of its interesting advantages is its flexibility allowing it to be used with dierent combinatorial search techniques. Thus, four specic metaheuristics are considered: simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms and ant colony optimization. Their good performance is shown when solving a real-world problem.

Database Schema Matching Using Machine Learning with Feature Selection Schema matching, the problem of finding mappings between the attributes of two  semantically related database schemas, is an important aspect of many database applications  such as schema integration, data warehousing, and electronic commerce.  Unfortunately, schema matching remains largely a manual, labor-intensive process.  Furthermore, the effort required is typically linear in the number of schemas to be  matched; the next pair of schemas to match is not any easier than the previous pair.  In this paper we describe a system, called Automatch, that uses machine learning  techniques to automate schema matching. Based primarily on Bayesian learning, the  system acquires probabilistic knowledge from examples that have been provided by  domain experts. This knowledge is stored in a knowledge base called the attribute  dictionary. When presented with a pair of new schemas that need to be matched (and  their corresponding database instances), Automatch uses the attribute dictionary to  find an optimal matching. We also report initial results from the Automatch project.  1

Heuristic Evaluation of Groupware Based on the Mechanics of Collaboration . Despite the increasing availability of groupware, most systems are  awkward and not widely used. While there are many reasons for this, a  significant problem is that groupware is difficult to evaluate. In particular, there  are no discount usability evaluation methodologies that can discover problems  specific to teamwork. In this paper, we describe how we adapted Nielsen's  heuristic evaluation methodology, designed originally for single user  applications, to help inspectors rapidly, cheaply effectively identify usability  problems within groupware systems. Specifically, we take the `mechanics of  collaboration' framework and restate it as heuristics for the purposes of  discovering problems in shared visual work surfaces for distance-separated  groups.  1.

At places like coffee shops, grocery stores, and offices we interact with people to trade news, tell stories, gossip or exchange goods and services. Often we use these situations  1  to pursue our own goals. For example, we purchase items, coordinate schedules, or make other arrangements when we meet other people.  Wearable computers provide a chance to augment such human every-day interactions and to advance cooperation (Why? Features of wearables: always on, always active, senses environment, proactive -- ability to support user during every-day life, ability to act as use...

Usability Engineering for Virtual Environments through a Framework of Usability Characteristics The goal of much work in virtual environments (VEs) to date has been to produce innovative visual, aural, and haptic technology; until recently, there has been very little user-centered, usability-focused research in VEs. However, there is beginning to be at least some awareness of the need for usability engineering within the VE community, mostly addressing particular parts of the VE usability space. This paper motivates the need for usability engineering methods specifically for VEs and describes a framework of usability characteristics for VEs. It gives a detailed example of use of the framework and supplemental VE usability resources in design and evaluation of a navigation metaphor for a real-world battlefield visualization VE application. Our goal is to increase awareness of the need for VE usability through this framework, which in turn will be used to produce usability engineering methods for development of VEs.

An Evolutionary Approach to Case Adaptation . We present a case adaptation method that employs ideas from the field of genetic algorithms. Two types of adaptations, case combination and case mutation, are used to evolve variations on the contents of retrieved cases until a satisfactory solution is found for a new specified problem. A solution is satisfactory if it matches the specified requirements and does not violate any constraints imposed by the domain of applicability. We have implemented our ideas in a computational system called GENCAD, applied to the layout design of residences such that they conform to the principles of feng shui, the Chinese art of placement. This implementation allows us to evaluate the use of GA's for case adaptation in CBR. Experimental results show the role of representation and constraints. 1 Introduction  Many different methods have been proposed for performing the task of case adaptation in CBR. They have been surveyed in several publications, including [1], [2], and [3]. Different approaches ma...

A Case Study on Case-Based and Symbolic Learning (Extended Abstract) )  Stefan Wess and Christoph Globig  University of Kaiserslautern, P.O. Box 3049 D-67653 Kaiserslautern, Germany  fwess, globigg@informatik.uni-kl.de Abstract  Contrary to symbolic learning approaches, which represent a learned concept explicitly, case-based approaches describe concepts implicitly by a pair (CB;sim), i.e. by a measure of similarity sim and a set CB of cases. This poses the question if there are any differences concerning the learning power of the two approaches. In this article we will study the relationship between the case base, the measure of similarity, and the target concept of the learning process. To do so, we transform a simple symbolic learning algorithm (the version space algorithm) into an equivalent case-based variant. The achieved results strengthen the hypothesis of the equivalence of the learning power of symbolic and case-based methods and show the interdependency between the measure used by a case-based algorithm and the target concept.

Automatic generation of fuzzy logic rule bases: Examples I Learning fuzzy rule-based systems with genetic algorithms can lead to very useful descriptions of several problems. Many different alternative descriptions can be generated. In many cases, a simple rule base similar to rule bases designed by humans is preferable since it has a higher possibility of being valid in unforeseen cases. Thus, the main idea of this paper is to study the genetic fuzzy rule base learning algorithm FRBL [1] by examples from the machine learning repository [2] and to compare it with some other approaches.

The personal interaction panel - a two-handed interface for augmented reality This paper describes the introduction of a new interaction paradigm to augmented reality applications. The everyday tool handling experience of working with pen and notebooks is extended to create a three dimensional two-handed interface, that supports easy-to-understand manipulation tasks in augmented and virtual environments. In the design step we take advantage from the freedom, given by our very low demands on hardware and augment form and functionality to this device. On the basis of examples from object manipulation, augmented research environments and scientific visualization we show the generality of applicability. Although being in the first stages implementation, we consider the wide spectrum of suitability for different purposes.

Improved Tracking of Multiple Humans with Trajectory Prediction and Occlusion Modeling A combined 2D, 3D approach is presented that allows for robust tracking of moving bodies in a given environment as observed via a single, uncalibrated video camera. Lowlevel features are often insufficient for detection, segmentation, and tracking of non-rigid moving objects. Therefore, an improved mechanism is proposed that combines lowlevel (image processing) and mid-level (recursive trajectory estimation) information obtained during the tracking process. The resulting system can segment and maintain the tracking of moving objects before, during, and after occlusion. At each frame, the system also extracts a stabilized coordinate frame of the moving objects. This stabilized frame can be used as input to motion recognition modules. The approach enables robust tracking without constraining the system to know the shape of the objects being tracked beforehand; although, some assumptions are made about the characteristics of the shape of the objects, and how they evolve with time.

Cooperation Mechanisms in a Multi-Agent Distributed Environment In the paper we present our work on design and analysis of agent cooperation in distributed systems. The work is not completed yet, so that some parts of it, especially the formal framework, should be viewed as a preliminary version. Multi-agent systems are represented by BDI-automata, i.e., asynchronous automata composed of non-deterministic agents equipped with mental attitudes like belief, desire, and intentions. These attitudes are acquired by the agents by executing so called mental actions. Behaviours of multi-agent systems are represented by prime event structures. The prime event structure when augmented with utility functions defined on the terminal nodes of the structure may be viewed as games in extensive form defined on local states rather than on global states as in the classical definition. The definition of knowledge, in our framework, captures the change of state due to action executions. A notion of local knowledge-based protocols is defined. A game theory method of backwards induction is applied in order to obtain a very natural definition of rationality in agent's behaviours. All the notions are exemplified using the running example. For this example we construct several cooperation mechanisms for the agents. A team formation mechanism is one of them.

Localizing and Segmenting Text in Images and Videos Many images---especially those used for page design on web pages---as well as videos contain visible text. If these text occurrences could be detected, segmented, and recognized automatically, they would be a valuable source of high-level semantics for indexing and retrieval. In this paper, we propose a novel method for localizing and segmenting text in complex images and videos. Text lines are identified by using a complex-valued multilayer feed-forward network trained to detect text at a fixed scale and position. The network's output at all scales and positions is integrated into a single text-saliency map, serving as a starting point for candidate text lines. In the case of video, these candidate text lines are refined by exploiting the temporal redundancy of text in video. Localized text lines are then scaled to a fixed height of 100 pixels and segmented into a binary image with black characters on white background. For videos, temporal redundancy is exploited to improve segmentation performance. Input images and videos can be of any size due to a true multiresolution approach. Moreover, the system is not only able to locate and segment text occurrences into large binary images, but is also able to track each text line with sub-pixel accuracy over the entire occurrence in a video, so that one text bitmap is created for all instances of that text line. Therefore, our text segmentation results can also be used for object -based video encoding such as that enabled by MPEG-4.

Graph-Theoretic Clustering for Image Grouping and Retrieval Image retrieval algorithms are generally based on the assumption that visually similar images are located close to each other in the feature space. Since the feature vectors usually exist in a very high dimensional space, a parametric characterization of their distribution is impossible, so non-parametric approaches, like the k-nearest neighbor search, are used for retrieval. This paper introduces a graph--theoretic approach for image retrieval by formulating the database search as a graph clustering problem by using a constraint that retrieved images should be consistent with each other (close in the feature space) as well as being individually similar (close) to the query image. The experiments that compare retrieval precision with and without clustering showed an average precision of 0.76 after clustering, which is an improvement by 5.56% over the average precision before clustering.  1. Motivation  Computing feature vectors is an essential step in image database retrieval algorithm...

System And Software Visualisation If the entire of what many consider to be the software visualisation field is reviewed, then this article would be much larger in size and also consist mainly of variations on the nodes and arcs theme. Because the use of the third dimension for system and software visualisation is emerging as a viable alternative for the representation of complex artefacts then it was considered much better to focus on this form of software visualisation. The previous techniques had various identified shortcomings and the space and freedom afforded by the extra dimension has the potential to be usefully employed to overcome some of these problems. Software visualisation can be seen as a specialised subset of information visualisation. This is because information visualisation is the process of creating a graphical representation of abstract, generally non-numerical, data. This is exactly what is required when trying to visualise software. The term software visualisation has many ...

Social Role Awareness in Animated Agents This paper promotes social role awareness as a desirable capability of animated agents, that are by now strong affective reasoners, but otherwise often lack the social competence observed with humans. In particular, humans may easily adjust their behavior depending on their respective role in a socio-organizational setting, whereas their synthetic pendants tend to be driven mostly by attitudes, emotions, and personality. Our main contribution is the incorporation of `social filter programs' to mental models of animated agents. Those programs may qualify an agent's expression of its emotional state by the social context, thereby enhancing the agent's believability as a conversational partner or virtual teammate. Our implemented system is entirely webbased and demonstrates socially aware animated agents in an environment similar to Hayes-Roth's Cybercaf'e.

Eddies: Continuously Adaptive Query Processing In large federated and shared-nothing databases, resources can exhibit widely fluctuating characteristics. Assumptions made at the time a query is submitted will rarely hold throughout the duration of query processing. As a result, traditional static query optimization and execution techniques are ineffective in these environments.  In this paper we introduce a query processing mechanism called an eddy, which continuously reorders operators in a query plan as it runs. We characterize the moments of symmetry  during which pipelined joins can be easily reordered, and the synchronization barriers that require inputs from different sources to be coordinated. By combining eddies with appropriate join algorithms, we merge the optimization and execution phases of query processing, allowing each tuple to have a flexible ordering of the query operators. This flexibility is controlled by a combination of fluid dynamics and a simple learning algorithm. Our initial implementation demonstrates prom...

Negation in Logic and Deductive Databases This thesis studies negation in logic and deductive databases. Among other things, two kinds of negation are discussed in detail: strong negation and nonmonotonic negation.  In the logic part, we have constructed a first-order logic CF  0  of strong negation with bounded quantifiers. The logic is based on constructive logics, in particular, Thomason's logic CF. However, unlike constructive logic, quantifiers in our system as in Thomason's are static rather than dynamic. For the logic CF  0  , the usual Kripke formal semantics is defined but based on situations instead of conventional possible worlds. A sound and complete axiomatic system of CF  0  is established based on the axiomatic systems of constructive logics with strong negation and Thomason's completeness proof techniques. CF  0  is proposed as the underlying logic for situation theory. Thus the connection between CF  0  and infon logic is briefly discussed.  In the database part, based on the study of some main existing semant...

An implementation of the  semantics that employs encryption is also outlined for use in untrusted  environments.  1 Introduction  Coordination languages based on shared data spaces have been around for over fifteen years.

Charting Past, Present and Future Research in Ubiquitous Computing The proliferation of computing into the physical world promises more than the ubiquitous availability of computing infrastructure; it suggests new paradigms of interaction inspired by constant access to information and computational capabilities. For the past decade, application-driven research in ubiquitous computing (ubicomp) has pushed three interaction themes: natural interfaces, context-aware applications, and automated capture and access. To chart a course for future research in ubiquitous computing, we review the accomplishments of these efforts and point to remaining research challenges. Research in ubiquitous computing implicitly requires addressing some notion of scale, whether in the number and type of devices, the physical space of distributed computing, or the number of people using a system. We posit a new area of applications research, everyday computing, focussed on scaling interaction with respect to time. Just as pushing the availability of computing away from the traditional desktop fundamentally changes the relationship between humans and computers, providing continuous interaction moves computing from a localized tool to a constant companion. Designing for continuous interaction requires addressing interruption and resumption of interaction, representing passages of time and providing associative storage models. Inherent

Applying Artificial Intelligence to Virtual Reality: Intelligent Virtual Environments Reearch into virtual environments on the one hand and artificial intelligence and artificial life  on the other has largely been carried out by two different groups of people with different preoccupations  and interests, but some convergence is now apparent between the two fields.

This approach has the advantage of being able to recommend previously unrated items to users with unique interests and to provide explanations for its recommendations.

A Memetic Algorithm With Self-Adaptive Local Search: TSP as a case study In this paper we introduce a promising hybridization scheme for a Memetic Algorithm (MA). Our MA is composed of two optimization processes, a Genetic Algorithm and a Monte Carlo method (MC). In contrast with other GA-Monte Carlo hybridized memetic algorithms, in our work the MC stage serves two purposes: -- when the population is diverse it acts like a local search procedure and -- when the population converges its goal is to diversify the search. To achieve this, the MC is self-adaptive based on observations from the underlying GA behavior; the GA controls the long-term optimization process. We present preliminary, yet statistically significant, results on the application of this approach to the TSP problem.We also comment it successful application to a molecular conformational problem: Protein Folding.

Automatic Generation of Warehouse Mediators Using an Ontology Engine Data warehouses created for dynamic scientific environments, such as genetics, face significant challenges to their long-term feasibility. One of the most significant of these is the high frequency of schema evolution resulting from both technological advances and scientific insight. Failure to quickly incorporate these modifications will quickly render the warehouse obsolete, yet each evolution requires significant effort to ensure the changes are correctly propagated. DataFoundry utilizes a mediated warehouse architecture with an ontology infrastructure to reduce the maintenance requirements of a warehouse. Among other things, the ontology is used as an information source for automatically generating mediators, the programs that transfer data between the data sources and the warehouse. The identification, definition, and representation of the metadata required to perform this task are the primary contributions of this work.  1 Introduction  The DataFoundry research project at LLNL's ...

Evolution and Revolutions in LDAP Directory Caches . LDAP directories have recently proliferated with the growth  of the Internet, and are being used in a wide variety of network-based  applications. In this paper, we propose the use of generalized queries,  referred to as query templates, obtained by generalizing individual user  queries, as the semantic basis for low overhead, high benefit LDAP directory  caches for handling declarative queries. We present efficient incremental  algorithms that, given a sequence of user queries, maintain a  set of potentially beneficial candidate query templates, and select a subset  of these candidates for admission into the directory cache. A novel  feature of our algorithms is their ability to deal with overlapping query  templates. Finally, we demonstrate the advantages of template caches  over query caches, with an experimental study based on real data and a  prototype implementation of the LDAP directory cache.  1 Introduction  LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) network directories ha...

How often are you given pages that tell you things you already know? While the search engines and related tools continue to make improvements in their information retrieval algorithms, for the most part they continue to ignore an essential part of the web ‚Äì the links. We have found that link analysis can have significant contributions to web page retrieval from search engines, to web community discovery, and to the measurement of web page influence. It can help to rank results and find high-quality index/hub/link pages that contain links to the best sites on the topic of interest. Our work is based on research from IBM‚Äôs CLEVER project [7, 4, 6], Stanford‚Äôs Google [3], and the Web Archaeology research [2, 1] at Compaq‚Äôs Systems Research Center.

This idea underlies all link analysis efforts, from the straightforward technique of counting the number of incoming edges to a page, to the deeper eigenvector analysis used in our work and in those projects mentioned above.

An Intelligent Approach to Information Integration . Information sharing from multiple heterogeneous sources is a challenging issue which ranges from database to ontology areas. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach to information integration which takes into account semantic conflicts and contradictions, caused by the lack of a common shared ontology. Our goal is to provide an  integrated access to information sources, allowing a user to pose a single query and to receive a single unified answer. We propose a "semantic" approach for integration where the conceptual schema of each source is provided, adopting a common standard data model and language.

Visual Recognition of Hand Motion Hand gesture recognition is an active area of research in recent years, being used in various applications from deaf sign recognition systems to humanmachine interaction applications. The gesture recognition process, in general, may be divided into two stages: the motion sensing, which extracts useful data from hand motion; and the classification process, which classifies the motion sensing data as gestures. The existing vision-based gesture recognition systems extract 2-D shape and trajectory descriptors from the visual input, and classify them using various classification techniques from maximum likelihood estimation to neural networks, finite state machines, Fuzzy Associative Memory (FAM) or Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

Automatic Detection of Human Faces in Natural Scene Images by Use of a Skin Color Model and of Invariant Moments We use a skin color model based on the Mahalanobis metric and a shape analysis based on invariant moments to automatically detect and locate human faces in two-dimensional natural scene images. First, color segmentation of an input image is performed by thresholding in a perceptually plausible hue-saturation color space where the effects of the variability of human skin color and the dependency of chrominance on changes in illumination are reduced. We then group regions of the resulting binary image which have been classified as face candidates into clusters of connected pixels. Performing median filtering on the image and discarding the smallest remaining clusters ensures that only a small number of clusters will be used for further analysis. Fully translation-, scale- and in-plane rotation-invariant moments are calculated for each remaining cluster. Finally, in order to distinguish faces from distractors, a multilayer perceptron neural network is used with the invariant moments as the input vector. Supervised learning of the network is implemented with the backpropagation algorithm, at first for frontal views of faces. Preliminary results show the efficiency of the combination of color segmentation and of invariant moments in detecting faces with a large variety of poses and against relatively complex backgrounds. 1.

Coordination Assistance for Mixed Human and Computational Agent Systems In many application areas (such as concurrent engineering, software development, hospital scheduling, manufacturing scheduling, and military planning), individuals are responsible for an agenda of tasks and face choices about the best way to locally handle each task, in what order to do tasks, and when to do them. Such decisions are often hard to make because of coordination problems: individual tasks are related to the tasks of others in complex ways, and there are many sources of uncertainty (no one has a complete view of the task structure at arbitrary levels of detail, the situation may be changing dynamically, and no one is entirely sure of the outcomes of all of their actions). The focus of this paper is the development of support tools for distributed, cooperative work by groups (collaborative teams) of human and computational agents.

Grounded Speech Communication Language is grounded in sensory-motor experience. Grounding connects concepts to the physical world enabling humans to acquire and use words and sentences in context. Currently, machines which process text and spoken language are not grounded in human-like ways. Instead, semantic representations in machines are highly abstract and have meaning only when interpreted by humans. We are interested in developing computational systems which represent words, utterances, and underlying concepts in terms of sensory-motor experiences, leading to richer levels of understanding by machines. Inspired by theories of infant cognition, we present a computational model which learns from untranscribed multisensory input. Acquired words are represented in terms associations between acoustic and visual sensory experience. The system has been tested in a robotic embodiment which supports interactive language learning and understanding. Successful learning has also been demonstrated using infant -directed s...

We present an efficient algorithm for data-driven knowledge discovery and theory refinement using DistAl, a novel (inter-pattern distance based, polynomial time) constructive neural network learning algorithm. The initial domain theory comprising of propositional rules is translated into a knowledge based network. The domain theory is modified using DistAl which adds new neurons to the existing network as needed to reduce classification errors associated with the incomplete domain theory on labeled training examples. The proposed algorithm is capable of handling patterns represented using binary, nominal, as well as numeric (real-valued) attributes. Results of experiments on several datasets for financial advisor and the human genome project indicate that the performance of the proposed algorithm compares quite favorably with other algorithms for connectionist theory refinement (including those that require substantially more computational resources) both in terms of generalization accuracy and network size.

Case-Based Learning: Beyond Classification of Feature Vectors . The dominant theme of case-based research at recent ML conferences has been on classifying cases represented by feature vectors. However, other useful tasks can be targeted, and other representations are often preferable. We review the recent literature on case-based learning, focusing on alternative performance tasks and more expressive case representations. We also highlight topics in need of additional research. 1 Introduction  The majority of machine learning (ML) research has focussed on supervised learning tasks in which class-labeled cases, each represented as a vector of features, are given to a learning algorithm that induces a concept description. This description can then be used to predict the class labels of unlabeled cases. One approach for solving supervised learning tasks, called case-based,  3  involves storing cases, often as hproblem,solutioni pairs, and retrieving them to solve similar problems. This distinguishes their behavior from approaches that greedily repla...

Running the Web Backwards: Appliance Data Services Appliance" digital devices such as handheld cameras, scanners, and microphones generate data that people want to put on Web pages. Unfortunately, numerous complex steps are required. Contrast this with Web output: handheld web browsers enjoy increasing infrastructural support such as user-transparent transformation proxies, allowing unmodified Web pages to be conveniently viewed on devices not originally designed for the task. We hypothesize that the utility of input appliances will be greatly increased if they too were "infrastructure enabled." Appliance Data Services attempts to systematically describe the task domain of providing seamless and graceful interoperability between input appliances and the Web. We offer an application architecture and a validating prototype that we hope will "open up the playing field" and motivate further work. Our initial efforts have identified two main design challenges: dealing with device heterogeneity, and providing a "no-futz" out-of-the-box user experience for novices without sacrificing expressive power for advanced users. We address heterogeneity by isolating device and protocol heterogeneity considerations into a single extensible architectural component, allowing most of the application logic to deal exclusively with Web-friendly protocols and formats. We address the user interface issue in two ways: first, by specifying how to tag input with commands that specify how data is to be manipulated once injected into the infrastructure; second, by describing a late-binding mechanism for these command tags, which allows "natural" extensions of the device's UI for application selection and minimizes the amount of configuration required before end-users benefit from Appliance Data Services. Finally, we describe how to leverage existi...

Towards an Accommodation of Delay in Temporal Active Databases Business rules can be formulated according to the eventcondition -action structure of triggers in active databases. However, delays in the execution of such rules can cause unexpected and undesired side-effects. While business rules are commonly constructed from an external user's perspective, users often neglect to cater for the cases in which unanticipated sequences of I/O and rule activation events occur. This paper examines this issue from the perspective of temporal databases and discusses a framework for accommodating delay in rule activation. In order to do this the paper also outlines a flexible technique to ensure correct transaction sequencing in transaction-time databases.  1 Introduction  Active database systems allow users to specify business rules, commonly in terms of (sets of) event-condition-action (E-C-A) triplets that specify that certain actions should be invoked when certain events occur and certain conditions hold [17]. Such rules are useful in providing an active...

Indexing and Retrieving Natural Language Using Ternary Expressions Traditional information retrieval systems based on the "bag-of-words" paradigm cannot completely capture the semantic content of documents. Yet it is impossible with current technology to build a practical information access system that fully analyzes and understands unrestricted natural language. However, if we avoid the most complex and processing-intensive natural language understanding techniques, we can construct a large-scale information access system which is capable of processing unrestricted text, largely understanding it, and answering natural language queries with high precision. We believe that ternary expressions are the most suitable representational structure for such a system; they are expressive enough for information retrieval purposes, yet amenable to rapid large-scale indexing.

Mobile Agents In Intrusion Detection And Response Effective intrusion detection capability is an elusive goal, not solved easily or with a single mechanism. However, mobile software agents go a long way toward realizing the ideal behavior desired in an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). This paper is an initial look at the relatively unexplored terrain of using mobile agents for intrusion detection and response. It looks not only at the benefits derived from mobility, but also those associated with software agent technology. We explore these benefits in some detail and propose a number of innovative ways to apply agent mobility to address the shortcomings of current IDS designs and implementations. We also look at new approaches for automating response to an intrusion, once detected. 1  Appeared in the proceedings of the 12th Annual Canadian Information Technology Security Symposium, Ottawa, Canada, June 2000.

On the Knowledge Requirements of Tasks In order to successfully perform a task, a situated system requires some information about its domain. If we can understand what information the system requires, we may be able to equip it with more suitable sensors or make better use of the information available to it. These considerations have motivated roboticists to examine the issue of sensor design, and in particular, the minimal information required to perform a task. We show here that reasoning in terms of what the robot knows and needs to know to perform a task is a useful approach for analyzing these issues. We extend the formal framework for reasoning about knowledge, already used in AI and distributed computing, by developing a set of basic concepts and tools for modeling and analyzing the knowledge requirements of tasks. We investigate properties of the resulting framework, and show how it can be applied to robotics tasks. 1 Introduction  The notion of computational complexity has had a profound effect on the development o...

An Integrated Ontology for the WWW . Knowledge-intensive processing of WWW information should  be founded on clear and uniform conceptualisation. An integrated ontology  covering different aspects of the WWW (documents, sites, network  addressing, HTML code) has been laid down, upon which a knowledge  base of the WWW domain is being built. This knowledge base should  support "intelligent" metasearch of the Web, in particular, postprocessing  of hit-lists returned by external search engines.  1 Introduction  During the last few years, the World-Wide Web has become one of the most widespread technologies of information presentation. It is thus not surprising that many Knowledge Engineering (KE) projects focus on it: some use HTML as a cheap, ready-made user-interface, other thrive to mine valuable information hidden inside existing WWW pages. A necessary prerequisite of mutual comprehensibility and knowledge reuse among different KE communities and projects dealing with the Web is a clear and unified conceptualisation, wh...

Signal Detection Using ICA: Application to Chat Room Topic Spotting Signal detection and pattern recognition for online grouping huge amounts of data and retrospective analysis is becoming increasingly important as knowledge based standards, such as XML and advanced MPEG, gain popularity. Independent component analysis (ICA) can be used to both cluster and detect signals with weak a priori assumptions in multimedia contexts. ICA of real world data is typically performed without knowledge of the number of non-trivial independent components, hence, it is of interest to test hypotheses concerning the number of components or simply to test whether a given set of components is significant relative to a "white noise" null hypothesis. It was recently proposed to use the so-called Bayesian information criterion (BIC) approximation, for estimation of such probabilities of competing hypotheses. Here, we apply this approach to the understanding of chat. We show that ICA can detect meaningful context structures in a chat room log file.  1.

Using Multi-Context Systems to Engineer Executable Agents In the area of agent-based computing there are many proposals  for specific system architectures, and a number of proposals for general  approaches to building agents. As yet, however, there are few  attempts to relate these together, and even fewer attempts to provide  methodologies which relate designs to architectures and then to executable  agents. This paper provides a first attempt to address this  shortcoming; we propose a general method of defining architectures  for logic-based agents which can be directly executed. Our approach is  based upon the use of multi-context systems and we illustrate its use  with an example architecture capable of argumentation-based negotiation.  1 Introduction  Agent-based computing is fast emerging as a new paradigm for engineering complex, distributed systems [13, 27]. An important aspect of this trend is the use of agent architectures as a means of delivering agent-based functionality (cf. work on agent programming languages [14, 23, 25]). In t...

Learning to Recommend from Positive Evidence In recent years, many systems and approaches for recommending information, products or other objects have been developed. In these systems, often machine learning methods that need training input to acquire a user interest profile are used. Such methods typically need positive and negative evidence of the user‚Äôs interests. To obtain both kinds of evidence, many systems make users rate relevant objects explicitly. Others merely observe the user‚Äôs behavior, which fairly obviously yields positive evidence; in order to be able to apply the standard learning methods, these systems mostly use heuristics that attempt to find also negative evidence in observed behavior. In this paper, we present several approaches to learning interest profiles from positive evidence only, as it is contained in observed user behavior. Thus, both the problem of interrupting the user for ratings and the problem of somewhat artificially determining negative evidence are avoided. The learning approaches were developed and tested in the context of the Web-based ELFI information system. It is in real use by more than 1000 people. We give a brief sketch of ELFI and describe the experiments we made based on ELFI usage logs to evaluate the different proposed methods.

Multi-agent Systems as Intelligent Virtual Environments Intelligent agent systems have been the subject of intensive research  over the past few years; they comprise one of the most promising computing  approaches ever, able to address issues that require abstract modelling and  higher level reasoning. Virtual environments, on the other hand, offer the ideal  means to produce simulations of the real world for purposes of entertainment,  education, and others. The merging of these two fields seems to have a lot to  offer to both research and applications, if progress is made on a co-ordinated  manner and towards standardization.

This framework allows us to combine different  normal forms, in particular, a separated normal form for temporal  logic and a first-order clausal form for modal logics. The calculus of the  framework consists of temporal resolution rules and standard first-order  resolution rules.

Approximating the non-dominated front using the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy We introduce a simple evolution scheme for multiobjective optimization problems, called the Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES). We argue that PAES may represent the simplest possible nontrivial algorithm capable of generating diverse solutions in the Pareto optimal set. The algorithm, in its simplest form, is a (1 + 1) evolution strategy employing local search but using a reference archive of previously found solutions in order to identify the approximate dominance ranking of the current and candidate solution vectors. (1 + 1)-PAES is intended to be a baseline approach against which more involved methods may be compared. It may also serve well in some real-world applications when local search seems superior to or competitive with population-based methods. We introduce (1 + Œª) and (Œº | Œª) variants of PAES as extensions to the basic algorithm. Six variants of PAES are compared to variants of the Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm and the Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm over a diverse suite of six test functions. Results are analyzed and presented using techniques that reduce the attainment surfaces generated from several optimization runs into a set of univariate distributions. This allows standard statistical analysis to be carried out for comparative purposes. Our results provide strong evidence that PAES performs consistently well on a range of multiobjective optimization tasks.

Introducing a Two-Level Grammar Concept for Design (Extended Abstract) this paper.  A few investigation may first illustrate the differences of our new concepts from known hierarchies. Even if L(G) is regular, L(DG) may be not context-free. There is no need for a proof as it is folklore that pattern languages are usually not context-free. We present a few further trivialities to warm up: In case j V j = 1, L(DG) is regular if and only if L(G) is regular. If T 1 and T 2 are disjoint, it holds: 1. Membership for L(DG) is uniformly decidable. 2. Emptyness for L(DG) is uniformly decidable. 3. Finiteness for L(DG) is uniformly decidable. There is no need for an explicit proof. The results above are immediately inherited from classical results in formal language theory (cf. [HU79]). Further properties seem to require particular assumptions. For the intended application domain, languages which satisfy T 1 n T 2 6= ; are of a particular importance. It may also be of a special interest to consider languages with a certain rate of letters from T 1 n T 2 in terminal words. 3.2 Graph Grammars

Intention Reconsideration in Complex Environments One of the key problems in the design of belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents is that of finding an appropriate policy for intention reconsideration. In previous work, Kinny and Georgeff investigated the effectiveness of several such reconsideration policies, and demonstrated that in general, there is no one best approach -- different environments demand different intention reconsideration strategies. In this paper, we further investigate the relationship between the effectiveness of an agent and its intention reconsideration policy in different environments. We empirically evaluate the performance of different reconsideration strategies in environments that are to varying degrees dynamic, inaccessible, and nondeterministic. In addition to our empirical results, we are able to give preliminary analytical results to explain some of our findings.

Ant Colony Optimisation for Virtual-Wavelength-Path Routing and Wavelength Allocation Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) is applied to the problem of routing and wavelength-allocation in a multi-wavelength all-optical virtual-wavelength-path routed transport network. Three variants of our ACO algorithm are proposed: local update (LU), global update/ distance (GU/D) and global update/occupancy (GU/O). All three extend the usual practice that ants are attracted by the pheromone trail of ants from their own colony: in our work, the artificial ants are also repelled by the pheromone of other colonies. Overall, the best ACO variant, GU/O, provides results that approach those of an earlier problem-specific heuristic on small- and medium-sized networks.  1 Introduction  Multi-wavelength all-optical transport networks have attracted considerable interest in recent years, because of their potential, by using multiple wavelengths in both optical transmission and optical switching, to provide the huge bandwidths necessary if broadband services are to be widely adopted [1].

Embodied Evolution: Embodying an Evolutionary Algorithm in a Population of Robots We introduce Embodied Evolution (EE) as a methodology for the automatic design of robotic controllers. EE is an evolutionary robotics (ER) technique that avoids the pitfalls of the simulate-and-transfer method, allows the speed-up of evaluation time by utilizing parallelism, and is particularly suited to future work on multi-agent behaviors. In EE, an evolutionary algorithm is distributed amongst and embodied within a population of physical robots that reproduce with one another while situated in the task environment. We have built a population of eight robots and successfully implemented our first experiments. The controllers evolved by EE compare favorably to hand-designed solutions for a simple task. We detail our methodology, report our initial results, and discuss the application of EE to more advanced and distributed robotics tasks. 1.

Empirical Performance Analysis of Linear Discriminant Classifiers In face recognition literature, holistic template matching systems and geometrical local feature based systems have been pursued . In the holistic approach, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) are popular ones. More recently, the combination of PCA and LDA has been proposed as a superior alternative over pure PCA and LDA. In this paper, we illustrate the rationales behind these methods and the pros and cons of applying them to pattern classification task. A theoretical performance analysis of LDA suggests applying LDA over the principal components from the original signal space or the subspace. The improved performance of this combined approach is demonstrated through experiments conducted on both simulated data and real data.  1 Introduction  Statistical pattern recognition techniques have been successfully applied to many problems, including speech recognition, automatic target recognition and image classification.

Learning Information Extraction Rules for Semi-structured and Free Text . A wealth of on-line text information can be made available to automatic processing by information extraction (IE) systems. Each IE application needs a separate set of rules tuned to the domain and writing style. WHISK helps to overcome this knowledge-engineering bottleneck by learning text extraction rules automatically. WHISK is designed to handle text styles ranging from highly structured to free text, including text that is neither rigidly formatted nor composed of grammatical sentences. Such semistructured text has largely been beyond the scope of previous systems.

Whole-Hand and Speech Input in Virtual Environments Recent approaches to providing users with a more natural method of interacting with computer applications have shown that more than one mode of input can be both beneficial and intuitive as a communication medium between humans and computers. Two modalities in particular, whole-hand and speech input, represent a natural form of communication that has been ingrained in our physical and mental makeup since birth. In this thesis, we investigate the use of whole-hand and speech input in virtual environments in the context of two applications domains: scientific visualization and interior design. By examining the two modalities individually and in combination, and through the creation of two application prototypes (Multimodal Scientific Visualization Tool and Room Designer), we present anumber of contributions including a set of interface guidelines and interaction techniques for whole-hand and speech input.

Online Learning with Random Representations We consider the requirements of online learning---learning which must be done incrementally and in realtime, with the results of learning available soon after each new example is acquired. Despite the abundance of methods for learning from examples, there are few that can be used effectively for online learning, e.g., as components of reinforcement learning systems. Most of these few, including radial basis functions, CMACs, Kohonen 's self-organizing maps, and those developed in this paper, share the same structure. All expand the original input representation into a higher dimensional representation in an unsupervised way, and then map that representation to the final answer using a relatively simple supervised learner, such as a perceptron or LMS rule. Such structures learn very rapidly and reliably, but have been thought either to scale poorly or to require extensive domain knowledge. To the contrary, some researchers (Rosenblatt, 1962; Gallant & Smith, 1987; Kanerva, 1988; Prager ...

Fuzzy Meta-Learning: Preliminary Results Learning from distributed data is becoming in  our times a necessity, but it is also a complex and  challenging task. Approaches developed so far  have not dealt with the uncertainty, imprecision  and vagueness involved in distributed learning.  Meta-Learning, a successful approach for distributed  data mining, is in this paper extended to  handle the imprecision and uncertainty of the local  models and the vagueness that characterizes  the meta-learning process. The proposed approach,  Fuzzy Meta-Learning uses a fuzzy inductive  algorithm to meta-learn a global model from  the degrees of certainty of the output of local  classifiers. This way more accurate models of  collective knowledge can be acquired from data  with application both to inherently distributed databases  and parts of a very large database.

We first create a 3D understanding of the relationship between the user, the projectors and the display surfaces. Then we use some new calibration and rendering techniques to create a simple procedure to effectively illuminate the surfaces.

Validating Access to External Information Sources in a Mediator Environment A mediator integrates existing information sources into a new application. In order to answer complex queries, the mediator splits them up into sub-queries which it sends to the information sources. Afterwards, it combines the replies to answer the original query. Since the information sources are usually external, autonomous systems, the access to them can sometimes be erroneous, most notably when the information source is changed. This results in an incorrect behaviour of the whole system. The question that this paper addresses, is: how to check whether or not the access was correct? The paper introduces a notational framework for the general information access validation problem, describes the typical errors that can occur in a mediator environment, and proposes several validation mechanisms. It is also investigated how the validation functionality can be integrated into the mediator architecture, and what the most important quality measures of a validation method are. Moreover, the practical usability of the presented approaches is demonstrated on a real-world application using Web-based information sources. Several measurements are performed to compare the presented methods with previous work in the field.

Space Discretization for Efficient Human Navigation There is a large body of research on motion control of legs in human models. However, they require specification of global paths in which to move. A method for automatically computing a global motion path for a human in 3D environment of obstacles is presented. Object space is discretized into a 3D grid of uniform cells and an optimal path is generated between two points as a discrete cell path. The grid is treated as graph with orthogonal links of uniform cost. A* search method is applied for path finding. By considering only the cells on the upper surface of objects on which human walks, a large portion of the grid is discarded from the search space, thus boosting efficiency.

A Comparison of Usage Evaluation and Inspection Methods for Assessing Groupware Usability Many researchers believe that groupware can only be evaluated by studying real collaborators in their real contexts, a process that tends to be expensive and timeconsuming. Others believe that it is more practical to evaluate groupware through usability inspection methods. Deciding between these two approaches is difficult, because it is unclear how they compare in a real evaluation situation. To address this problem, we carried out a dual evaluation of a groupware system, with one evaluation applying userbased techniques, and the other using inspection methods. We compared the results from the two evaluations and concluded that, while the two methods have their own strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs, they are complementary. Because the two methods found overlapping problems, we expect that they can be used in tandem to good effect, e.g., applying the discount method prior to a field study, with the expectation that the system deployed in the more expensive field study has a better chance of doing well because some pertinent usability problems will have already been addressed.

A Description Logic with Concrete Domains and a Role-forming Predicate Operator Description Logics (DLs) are a family of logic-based knowledge representation formalisms designed to represent and reason about conceptual knowledge. Due to a nice compromise between expressivity and the complexity of reasoning, DLs have found applications in many areas such as, e.g., modelling database schemas and the semantic web. However, description logics represent knowledge in an abstract way and lack the power to describe more concrete (quantitative) qualities like size, duration, or amounts. The standard solution is to equip DLs with concrete domains, e.g., natural numbers with predicates =, <, + or strings with a string concatenation predicate. Moreover, recently it has been suggested that the expressive power of DLs with concrete domains can be further enhanced by providing them with database-like key constraints. Key constraints can be a source of additional inconsistencies in database schemas, and DLs applied in reasoning about database schemas are thus wanted to be able to capture such constraints. Up to now, only the integration of uniqueness key constraints into DLs with concrete

On the Difference of Horn Theories In this paper, we consider computing the difference between two Horn theories. This problem may arise, for example, if we take care of a theory change in a knowledge base. In general, the difference of Horn theories is not Horn. Therefore, we consider Horn approximations of the difference in terms of Horn cores (i.e., weakest Horn theories included in the difference) and the Horn envelope (i.e., the strongest Horn theory containing the difference), which have been proposed and analyzed extensively in the literature. We study the problem under the familiar representation of Horn theories by Horn CNFs, as well as under the recently proposed model-based representation in terms of the characteristic models. For all problems and representations, polynomial time algorithms or proofs of intractability for the propositional case are provided; thus, our work gives a complete picture of the tractability/intractability frontier in the propositional Horn theories.

Extending Local Learners with Error-Correcting Output Codes : Error-correcting output codes (ECOCs) represent classes with a set of output bits, where each bit encodes a binary classification task corresponding to a unique partition of the classes. Algorithms that use ECOCs learn the function corresponding to each bit, and combine them to generate class predictions. ECOCs can reduce both variance and bias errors for multiclass classification tasks when the errors made at the output bits are not correlated. They work well with global (e.g., C4.5) but not with local (e.g., nearest neighbor) classifiers because the latter use the same information to predict each bit's value, which yields correlated errors. This is distressing because local learners are excellent classifiers for some types of applications. We show that the output bit errors of local learners can be decorrelated by selecting different features for each bit. This yields bit-specific distance functions, which causes different information to be used for each bit's prediction. We presen...

A Scalable Algorithm for Answering Queries Using Views The problem of answering queries using views is  to find efficient methods of answering a query using  a set of previously materialized views over the  database, rather than accessing the database relations.  The problem has received significant attention  because of its relevance to a wide variety of  data management problems, such as data integration,  query optimization, and the maintenance of  physical data independence. To date, the performance  of proposed algorithms has received very  little attention, and in particular, their scale up in  the presence of a large number of views is unknown.  We first analyze two previous algorithms, the  bucket algorithm and the inverse-rules algorithm,  and show their deficiencies. We then describe the  MiniCon algorithm, a novel algorithm for finding  the maximally-contained rewriting of a conjunctive  query using a set of conjunctive views.  We present the first experimental study of algorithms  for answering queries using views. The  study shows that the MiniCon algorithm scales up  well and significantly outperforms the previous algorithms.  Finally, we describe an extension of the  MiniCon algorithm to handle comparison predicates,  and show its performance experimentally.

liu98relationlog
Relationlog: A Typed Extension to Datalog with Sets and Tuples This paper presents a novel logic programming based language for nested relational and complex value models called Relationlog. It stands in the same relationship to the nested relational and complex value models as Datalog stands to the relational model. The main novelty of the language is the introduction of powerful mechanisms, namely, partial and complete set terms, for representing and manipulating both partial and complete information on nested sets, tuples and relations. They generalize the set grouping and set enumeration mechanisms of LDL and allow the user to directly encode the open and closed world assumptions on nested sets, tuples, and relations. They allow direct inference and access to deeply embedded values in a complex value relation as if the relation is normalized, which greatly increases the ease of use of the language. As a result, the extended relational algebra operations can be represented in Relationlog directly, and more importantly, recursively in a way similar to Datalog. Like Datalog, Relationlog has a well-defined Herbrand model-theoretic semantics, which captures the intended semantics of nested sets, tuples and relations, and also a well-defined proof-theoretic semantics which coincides with its model-theoretic semantics.

The Importance of Being Mobile: Some Social Consequences of Wearable Augmented Reality Systems What are the consequences of mobility for augmented reality ? This brief paper explores some of the issues that I believe will be raised by the development and future commonplace adoption of mobile, wearable, augmented reality systems. These include: social influences on tracking accuracy, the importance of appearance and comfort, an increase in collaborative applications, integration with other devices, and implications for personal privacy.  1. Introduction  Over the past decade, the reality of mobile computing has begun to embrace the potential of wearable computing. In the process, several researchers have attempted to clarify what distinguishes wearable computing from mobile computing. Rhodes [10] suggests five criteria for wearable systems: portable while operational, needing minimal manual input, sensitive to the user's surrounding environment, always on, and able to attract the user's attention even when not actively in use. Mann [8] cites three desirable properties for wearabl...

Event-Learning And Robust Policy Heuristics . In this paper we introduce a novel form of reinforcement learning called event-learning or E-learning. Events are ordered pairs of consecutive states. We define the corresponding event-value function. Learning rules which are guaranteed to converge to the optimal event-value function are derived. Combining our method with a known robust control method, the SDS algorithm, we introduce Robust Policy Heuristics (RPH). It is shown that RPH (a fast-adapting non-Markovian policy) is particularly useful for coarse models of the environment and for partially observed systems. Fast adaptation may allow to separate the time scale of learning to control a Markovian process and the time scale of adaptation of a non-Markovian policy. In our E-learning framework the de nition of modules is straightforward. E-learning is well suited for policy switching and planning, whereas RPH alleviates the `curse of dimensionality' problem. Computer simulations of a two-link pendulum with coarse discretization and noisy controller are shown to demonstrate the underlying principle.

Techniques For Automatic Digital Video Composition Recent developments in digital technology have enabled a class of video-based applications that were not previously viable. However, digital video production systems face the challenge of accessing the inherently linear and time-dependent media of audio and video, and providing effective means of composing them into a cohesive piece for presentation. Moreover, there are no appropriate metrics that allow for assessment of the quality of an automatically-composed video piece. Techniques presently available are limited in scope, and do not account for all the features of a composition. This dissertation presents metrics that evaluate the quality of a video composition. In addition, it proposes techniques for automatic composition of video presentations as well as improvements in access to digital video data. Yet another challenge faced by video production systems is the customization of the presentation to suit user profiles. For instance, certain elements of video compositions, such as v...

The Evolution of the Soar Cognitive Architecture The origins of the Soar architecture can be traced back to the seminal research of Allen Newell and Herbert Simon on symbol systems, heuristic search, goals, problem spaces, and production systems. Since its official inception in 1982, Soar has evolved through six major releases, as both an AI architecture and as the basis for a unified theory of cognition. This paper traces this evolutionary path, starting with Soar's intellectual roots, and then proceeding through the stages defined by the six major system releases. Each stage is characterized with respect to a hierarchy of four levels of analysis: the knowledge level, the problem space level, the symbolic architecture level, and the implementation level.

Distance Browsing in Spatial Databases Two different techniques of browsing through a collection of spatial objects stored in an R-tree spatial data structure on the basis of their distances from an arbitrary spatial query object are compared. The conventional approach is one that makes use of a k-nearest neighbor algorithm where k is known prior to the invocation of the algorithm. Thus if m#kneighbors are needed, the k-nearest neighbor algorithm needs to be reinvoked for m neighbors, thereby possibly performing some redundant computations. The second approach is incremental in the sense that having obtained the k nearest neighbors, the k +1  st  neighbor can be obtained without having to calculate the k +1nearest neighbors from scratch. The incremental approach finds use when processing complex queries where one of the conditions involves spatial proximity (e.g., the nearest city to Chicago with population greater than a million), in which case a query engine can make use of a pipelined strategy. A general incremental nearest neighbor algorithm is presented that is applicable to a large class of hierarchical spatial data structures. This algorithm is adapted to the R-tree and its performance is compared to an existing k-nearest neighbor algorithm for R-trees [45]. Experiments show that the incremental nearest neighbor algorithm significantly outperforms the k-nearest neighbor algorithm for distance browsing queries in a spatial database that uses the R-tree as a spatial index. Moreover, the incremental nearest neighbor algorithm also usually outperforms the k-nearest neighbor algorithm when applied to the k-nearest neighbor problem for the R-tree, although the improvement is not nearly as large as for distance browsing queries. In fact, we prove informally that, at any step in its execution, the incremental...

A Query Paradigm to Discover the Relation between Text and Images This paper studies the relation between images and text in image databases. An analysis of this relation results in the definition of three distinct query modalities: (1) linguistic scenario: images are part of a whole including a self-contained linguistic discourse, and their meaning derives from their interaction with the linguistic discourse. A typical case of this scenario is constituted by images on the World Wide Web; (2) closed world scenario: images are defined in a limited domain, and their meaning is anchored by conventions and norms in that domain. (3) user scenario: the linguistic discourse is provided by the user. This is the case of highly interactive systems with relevance feedback.  This paper deals with image databases of the first type. It shows how the relation between images (or parts of images) and text can be inferred, and exploited for search. The paper develops a similarity model in which the similarity between two images is given by both their visual similarity...

Compensatory Negotiation for Agent-Based Project Schedule Coordination Practitioners have tried to solve a project schedule coordination problem involving many subcontractors with a centralized approach, but failed to provide a cohesive solution. They have overlooked a principle that general contractors cannot coordinate subcontractors like they do their own forces. The project schedule coordination problem could be solved better by subcontractors in a distributed manner. This paper presents a formalized negotiation methodology for distributed project schedule coordination --- a framework wherein a project can be rescheduled dynamically by all of the concerned project participants. The compensatory negotiation methodology is developed to allow agents to transfer utility to other agents for compensation of disadvantageous agreements through a multi-linked negotiation process. By employing software agents that are capable of compensatory negotiation, practitioners now can solve the problem and explore and exploit new opportunities an agent-based framework offers.  1.

Dialogue Management for Multimodal User Registration User registration refers to associating certain personal information with a user. It is widely used in hospitals, hotels and conferences. In this paper, we propose an approach to interactive user registration by combining face recognition, speech recognition and speech synthesis technologies together through an efficient dialogue manager. In order to minimize a user‚Äôs effort, we employ a new dialogue management model based on a finite state automaton (FSA), which uses a Baysian network to fuse the user‚Äôs information from multiple channels (e.g., face image, speech, records stored in a pre-constructed database) to reliably estimate the confidence about user identity. Instead of fixing weights, the FSA adjusts its weights dynamically by integrating partial information from multiple information sources. This is achieved by maximizing an objective function to determine an optimal action at each succeeding state according to current confidence and information cues. Thus the transition between states can be done along the shortest path from the initial state to the goal state. We have developed a multimodal user registration system to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach.

Task-Oriented Collaboration with Embodied Agents in Virtual Worlds   We are working toward animated agents that can collaborate with human students in virtual worlds. The agent's objective is to help students learn to perform physical, procedural tasks, such as operating and maintaining equipment. Like most of the previous research on task-oriented dialogues, the agent (computer) serves as an expert that can provide guidance to a human novice. Research on such dialogues dates back more than twenty years (Deutsch 1974), and the subject remains an active research area (Allen et al. 1996; Lochbaum 1994; Walker 1996). However, most of that research has focused solely on verbal dialogues, even though the earliest studies clearly showed the ubiquity of nonverbal communication in human task-oriented dialogues (Deutsch 1974). To allow a wider variety of interactions among agents and human students, we use virtual reality (Durlach and Mavor 1995); agents and students cohabit a threedimensional, interactive, simulated mock-up of the student'

Improving Min/Max Aggregation over Spatial Objects We examine the problem of computing MIN/MAX aggregate queries over a collection of spatial objects. Each spatial object is associated with a weight (value), for example, the average temperature or rainfall over the area covered by the object. Given a query rectangle, the MIN/MAX problem computes the minimum/maximum weight among all objects intersecting the query rectangle. Traditionally such queries have been performed as range search queries. Assuming that the objects are indexed by a spatial access method, the MIN/MAX is computed as objects are retrieved. This requires effort proportional to the number of objects intersecting the query interval, which may be large. A better approach is to maintain aggregate information among the index nodes of the spatial access method; then various index paths can be eliminated during the range search. In this paper we propose four optimizations that further improve the performance of MIN/MAX queries. Our experiments show that the proposed optimizations offer drastic performance improvement over previous approaches. Moreover, as a by-product of this work we present an optimized version of the MSB-tree, an index that has been proposed for the MIN/MAX computation over 1-dimensional interval objects.

Content-Based Book Recommending Using Learning for Text Categorization Recommender systems improve access to relevant products and information by making personalized suggestions based on previous examples of a user's likes and dislikes. Most existing recommender systems use collaborative filtering methods that base recommendations on other users' preferences. By contrast, content-based methods use information about an item itself to make suggestions. This approach has the advantage of being able to recommend previously unrated items to users with unique interests and to provide explanations for its recommendations. We describe a content-based book recommending system that utilizes information extraction and a machine-learning algorithm for text categorization. Initial experimental results demonstrate that this approach can produce accurate recommendations.

Integrating Multiple Classifiers In Visual Object Detectors Learned From User Input There have been many recent efforts in contentbased retrieval to perform automatic classification of images/visual objects. Most approaches, however, have focused on using individual classifiers. In this paper, we study the way in which, in a dynamic framework, multiple classifiers can be combined when applying Visual Object Detectors. We propose a hybrid classifier combination approach, in which decisions of individual classifiers are combined in the following three ways: (1) classifier fusion, (2) classifier cooperation, and (3) hierarchical combination. In earlier work, we presented the Visual Apprentice framework, in which a user defines visual object models via a multiple-level object-definition hierarchy (region, perceptual-area, object part, and object). As the user provides examples from images or videos, visual features are extracted and multiple classifiers are learned for each node of the hierarchy. In this paper, we discuss the benefits of hybrid classifier combination in the Visual Apprentice framework, and show some experimental results in classifier fusion. These results suggest possible improvements in classification accuracy, particularly of detectors reported earlier for Baseball video, images with skies, and images with handshakes.

The Security Architecture of the M&M Mobile Agent Framework In the Mobile Agent programming model, small threads of execution migrate from machine to machine, performing their operations locally. For being able to deploy such a model into real world applications, security is a vital concern. In the M&M project we have developed a system that departures from the traditional platform-based execution model for mobile agents. In M&M there are no agent platforms. Instead there is a component framework that allows the applications to become able of sending and receiving agents by themselves in a straightforward manner. In this paper we examine the security mechanisms available in M&M, and how integration with existing applications is done. One difficult aspect of this work is that all the features must work with the security mechanisms that already exist on the applications. This is so because the components are integrated from within into the applications, which already have security mechanisms in place. Currently, M&M provides features like fine-grain security permissions, encryption of agents and data, certificate distribution using LDAP and cryptographic primitives for agents. For validating the approach and solutions found, we have integrated the framework into several off-the-shelf web servers, having the security mechanisms running, with no problems.

Learning to Classify Text from Labeled and Unlabeled Documents In many important text classification problems, acquiring class labels for training documents is costly, while gathering large quantities of unlabeled data is cheap. This paper shows that the accuracy of text classifiers trained with a small number of labeled documents can be improved by augmenting this small training set with a large pool of unlabeled documents. We present a theoretical argument showing that, under common assumptions, unlabeled data contain information about the target function. We then introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled text based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization with a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents; it then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. Experimental results, obtained using text from three different realworld tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 33%.

Comparing Structures using a Hopfield-style Neural Network Labeled graphs are an appropriate and popular representation of structured objects in many domains. If the labels describe the properties of real world objects and their relations, finding the best match between two graphs turns out to be the weakly defined, NP-complete task of establishing a mapping between them that maps similar parts onto each other preserving as much as possible of their overall structural correspondence. In this paper, former approaches of structural matching and constraint relaxation by spreading activation in neural networks and the method of solving optimization tasks using Hopfield-style nets are combined. The approximate matching task is reformulated as the minimization of a quadratic energy function. The design of the approach enables the user to change the parameters and the dynamics of the net so that knowledge about matching preferences is included easily and transparently. In the last section, some examples demonstrate the successful application of ...

Non-Standard Crossover for a Standard Representation -- Commonality-Based Feature Subset Selection The Commonality-Based Crossover Framework has been presented as a general model for designing problem specific operators. Following this model, the Common Features/Random Sample Climbing operator has been developed for feature subset selection--a binary string optimization problem. Although this problem should be an ideal application for genetic algorithms with standard crossover operators, experiments show that the new operator can find better feature subsets for classifier training. 1 INTRODUCTION  A classification system is used to predict the decision class of an object based on its features. When training a classifier, it is beneficial to use only the features relevant to prediction accuracy, and to ignore the irrelevant features [Koh95]. The benefit arises from an increase in the "signalto -noise ratio" of the data, and a reduction in the time required to train the classifier. Thus, the objective of feature subset selection is to identify the (most) relevant features. Feature sub...

The 3W Model and Algebra for Unified Data Mining Real data mining/analysis applications call for a  framework which adequately supports knowledge  discovery as a multi-step process, where the input  of one mining operation can be the output of another.  Previous studies, primarily focusing on fast  computation of one specific mining task at a time,  ignore this vital issue.  Motivated by this observation, we develop a unified  model supporting all major mining and analysis  tasks. Our model consists of three distinct  worlds, corresponding to intensional and extensional  dimensions, and to data sets. The notion of  dimension is a centerpiece of the model. Equipped  with hierarchies, dimensions integrate the output  of seemingly dissimilar mining and analysis operations  in a clean manner.

Web Interaction and the Navigation Problem in Hypertext written for Encyclopedia of Microcomputers The web has become a ubiquitous tool, used in day-to-day work, to find information  and conduct business, and it is revolutionising the role and availability of information. One  of the problems encountered in web interaction, which is still unsolved, is the navigation  problem, whereby users can "get lost in hyperspace", meaning that when following a  sequence of links, i.e. a trail of information, users tend to become disoriented in terms of  the goal of their original query and the relevance to the query of the information they are  currently browsing.  Herein we build statistical foundations for tackling the navigation problem based on a  formal model of the web in terms of a probabilistic automaton, which can also be viewed  as a finite ergodic Markov chain. In our model of the web the probabilities attached  to state transitions have two interpretations, namely, they can denote the proportion of  times a user followed a link, and alternatively they can denote the expected utility of  following a link. Using this approach we have developed two techniques for constructing a  web view based on the two interpretations of the probabilities of links, where a web view  is a collection of relevant trails. The first method we describe is concerned with finding  frequent user behaviour patterns. A collection of trails is taken as input and an ergodic  Markov chain is produced as output with the probabilities of transitions corresponding  to the frequency the user traversed the associated links. The second method we describe  is a reinforcement learning algorithm that attaches higher probabilities to links whose  expected trail relevance is higher. The user's home page and a query are taken as input  and an ergodic Markov chain is produced as output with the probabilities of...

A Bayesian Computer Vision System for Modeling Human Interactions Abstract√êWe describe a real-time computer vision and machine learning system for modeling and recognizing human behaviors in a visual surveillance task [1]. The system is particularly concerned with detecting when interactions between people occur and classifying the type of interaction. Examples of interesting interaction behaviors include following another person, altering one's path to meet another, and so forth. Our system combines top-down with bottom-up information in a closed feedback loop, with both components employing a statistical Bayesian approach [2]. We propose and compare two different state-based learning architectures, namely, HMMs and CHMMs for modeling behaviors and interactions. The CHMM model is shown to work much more efficiently and accurately. Finally, to deal with the problem of limited training data, a synthetic ¬™Alife-style¬∫ training system is used to develop flexible prior models for recognizing human interactions. We demonstrate the ability to use these a priori models to accurately classify real human behaviors and interactions with no additional tuning or training.

User Modeling for Information Access Based on Implicit Feedback User modeling can be used in information filtering and retrieval systems to improve the representation of a user's information needs. User models can be constructed by hand, or learned automatically based on feedback provided by the user about the relevance of documents that they have examined. By observing user behavior, it is possible to infer implicit feedback without requiring explicit relevance judgments. Previous studies based on Internet discussion groups (USENET news) have shown reading time to be a useful source of implicit feedback for predicting a user's preferences. The study reported in this paper extends that work by providing framework for considering alternative sources of implicit feedback, examining whether reading time is useful for predicting a user's preferences for academic and professional journal articles, and exploring whether retention behavior can usefully augment the information that reading time provides. Two user studies were conducted in which undergradua...

Language Models for Financial News Recommendation We present a unique approach to identifying news stories that influence the behavior of financial markets. Specifically, we describe the design and implementation of &AElig;nalyst, a system that can recommend interesting news stories -- stories that are likely to affect market behavior. &AElig;nalyst operates by correlating the content of news stories with trends in financial time series. We identify trends in time series using piecewise linear fitting and then assign labels to the trends according to an automated binning procedure. We use language models to represent patterns of language that are highly associated with particular labeled trends. &Aelig;nalyst can then identify and recommend news stories that are highly indicative of future trends. We evaluate the system in terms of its ability to recommend the stories that will a ect the behavior of the stock market. We demonstrate that stories recommended by &Aelig;nalyst could be used to profitably predict forthcoming trends in stock prices.

Guaranteeing No Interaction between Functional Dependencies and Tree-Like Inclusion Dependencies Functional dependencies (FDs) and inclusion dependencies (INDs) are the most fundamental integrity constraints that arise in practice in relational databases. A given set of FDs does not interact with a given set of INDs if logical implication of any FD can be determined solely by the given set of FDs, and logical implication of any IND can be determined solely by the given set of INDs. The set of tree-like INDs constitutes a useful subclass of INDs whose implication problem is polynomial time decidable. We exhibit a necessary and sufficient condition for a set of FDs and tree-like INDs not to interact; this condition can be tested in polynomial time. 1 Introduction  The implication problem for FDs and INDs is the problem of deciding for a given set \Sigma of FDs and INDs whether \Sigma logically implies oe, where oe is an FD or an IND.

1BC: a First-Order Bayesian Classifier . In this paper we present 1BC, a first-order Bayesian Classifier. Our approach is to view individuals as structured terms, and to distinguish between structural predicates referring to subterms (e.g. atoms from molecules), and properties applying to one or several of these subterms (e.g. a bond between two atoms). We describe an individual in terms of elementary features consisting of zero or more structural predicates and one property; these features are considered conditionally independent following the usual naive Bayes assumption. 1BC has been implemented in the context of the first-order descriptive learner Tertius,  and we describe several experiments demonstrating the viability of our approach. 1 Introduction  In this paper we present 1BC, a first-order Bayesian Classifier.

Improving Cross Language Retrieval with Triangulated Translation Most approaches to cross language information retrieval assume that resources providing a direct translation between the query and document languages exist. This paper presents research examining the situation where such an assumption is false. Here, an intermediate (or pivot) language provides a means of transitive translation of the query language to that of the document via the pivot, at the cost, however, of introducing much error. The paper reports the novel approach of translating in parallel across multiple intermediate languages and fusing the results. Such a technique removes the error, raising the effectiveness of the tested retrieval system, up to and possibly above the level expected, had a direct translation route existed. Across a number of retrieval situations and combinations of languages, the approach proves to be highly effective.

Augmentedreality #1# refers to the creation of virtual environments that supplement, rather than replace, the real world with additional information. This is accomplished through the use of #see-through" displays that enrich the user's view of the world byoverlaying visual, auditory, and even haptic, material on what she experiences. Visual augmented reality systems typically, but not exclusively, employ head-tracked, head-worn displays. These either use half-silvered mirror beam splitters to re#ect small computer displays, optically combining them with a view of the real world, or use opaque displays fed by electronics that merge imagery captured by head-worn cameras with synthesized graphics.

Gestural Interface to a Visual Computing Environment for Molecular Biologists In recent years there has been tremendous progress in 3D, immersive display and virtual reality (VR) technologies. Scientific visualization of data is one of many applications that has benefited from this progress. To fully exploit the potential of these applications in the new environment there is a need for "natural" interfaces that allow the manipulation of such displays without burdensome attachments. This paper describes the use of visual hand gesture analysis enhanced with speech recognition for developing a bimodal gesture/speech interface for controlling a 3-D display. The interface augments an existing application, VMD, which is a VR visual computing environment for molecular biologists. The free hand gestures are used for manipulating the 3-D graphical display together with a set of speech commands. We concentrate on the visual gesture analysis techniques used in developing this interface. The dual modality of gesture/speech is found to greatly aid the interaction capability....

Secure Mobile Agent using Strong Non-designated Proxy Signature It is expected that mobile agent will be widely used for electronic  commerce as an important key technology. If a mobile agent can  sign a message in a remote server on behalf of a customer without exposing  his/her private key, it can be used not only to search for special  products or services, but also to make a contract with a remote server. To  construct mobile agents, [KBC00] used an RSA-based undetachable signature  scheme, but it does not provide server's non-repudiation because  the undetachable signature does not contain server's signature.  Mobile agent is a very good application example of proxy signature,  and the undetachable signature can be considered as an example of  proxy signature. In this paper we show that secure mobile agent can be  constructed using strong non-designated proxy signature [LKK01] which  represents both the original signer's (customer) and the proxy signer's  (remote server) signatures. We provide RSA-based and Schnorr-based  constructions of secure mobile agent, and moreover we show that the  Schnorr-based scheme can be used very eciently in multi-proxy mobile  agent situation.

Feature Weighting for Lazy Learning Algorithms :  Learning algorithms differ in the degree to which they process their inputs prior to their use in performance tasks. Many algorithms eagerly compile input samples and use only the compilations to make decisions. Others are lazy: they perform less precompilation and use the input samples to guide decision making. The performance of many lazy learners significantly degrades when samples are defined by features containing little or misleading information. Distinguishing feature relevance is a critical issue for these algorithms, and many solutions have been developed that assign weights to features. This chapter introduces a categorization framework for feature weighting approaches used in lazy similarity learners and briefly surveys some examples in each category. 1.1 INTRODUCTION  Lazy learning algorithms are machine learning algorithms (Mitchell, 1997) that are welcome members of procrastinators anonymous.

Situation Aware Computing with Wearable Computers 1 Motivation for contextual aware computing: For most computer systems, even virtual reality systems, sensing techniques are a means of getting input directly from the user. However, wearable sensors and computers offer a unique opportunity to re-direct sensing technology towards recovering more general user context. Wearable computers have the potential to "see" as the user sees, "hear" as the user hears, and experience the life of the user in a "first-person" sense. This increase in contextual and user information may lead to more intelligent and fluid interfaces that use the physical world as part of the interface. Wearable computers are excellent platforms for contextually aware applications, but these applications are also necessary to use wearables to their fullest. Wearables are more than just highly portable computers, they perform useful work even while the wearer isn't directly interacting with the system. In such environments the user needs to concentrate on his environment, not on the computer interface, so the wearable needs to use information from the wearer's context to be the least distracting. For example, imagine an interface which is aware of the user's location: while being in the subway, the system might alert him with a

Active Views for Electronic Commerce Electronic commerce is emerging as a major Web-supported application. In this paper we argue that database technology can, and should, provide the backbone for a wide range of such applications. More precisely, we present here the ActiveViews system, which, relaying on an extensive use of database features including views, active rules (triggers), and enhanced mechanisms for notification, access control and logging/tracing of users activities, provides the needed basis for electronic commerce. Based on the emerging XML standards (DOM, query languages for XML, etc.), the system offers a novel declarative view specification language, describing the relevant data and activities of all actors (e.g. vendors and clients) participating in electronic commerce activities . Then, acting as an application generator, the system generates an actual, possibly customized, Web application that allows users to perform the given set of controlled activities and to work interactively on the specified dat...

Temporal Patterns (TRAPs) in ASR of Noisy Speech In this paper we study a new approach to processing temporal information for automatic speech recognition (ASR). Specifically, we study the use of rather longtime TempoRAl Patterns (TRAPs) of spectral energies in place of the conventional spectral patterns for ASR. The proposed Neural TRAPs are found to yield significant amount of complementary information to that of the conventional spectral feature based ASR system. A combination of these two ASR systems is shown to result in improved robustness to several types of additive and convolutive environmental degradations.  1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Spectral features  Spectrum-based techniques form the basis of most feature extraction methods in current ASR. A drawback of the spectral features is that they are quite sensitive to changes in the communication environment e.g. characteristics of different communication channels or environmental noise. Subsequently, recognizers based on spectral features exhibit rapid degradation in performance in ...

Remote Agent: To Boldly Go Where No AI System Has Gone Before Renewed motives for space exploration have inspired NASA to work toward the goal of establishing a virtual presence in space, through heterogeneous effets of robotic explorers. Information technology, and Artificial Intelligence in particular, will play a central role in this endeavor by endowing these explorers with a form of computational intelligence that we call remote agents. In this paper we describe the Remote Agent, a specific autonomous agent architecture based on the principles of model-based programming, on-board deduction and search, and goal-directed closed-loop commanding, that takes a significant step toward enabling this future. This architecture addresses the unique characteristics of the spacecraft domain that require highly reliable autonomous operations over long periods of time with tight deadlines, resource constraints, and concurrent activity among tightly coupled subsystems. The Remote Agent integrates constraint-based temporal planning and scheduling, robust multi-threaded execution, and model-based mode identification and reconfiguration. The demonstration of the integrated system as an on-board controller for Deep Space One, NASA's rst New Millennium mission, is scheduled for a period of a week in late 1998. The development of the Remote Agent also provided the opportunity to reassess some of AI's conventional wisdom about the challenges of implementing embedded systems, tractable reasoning, and knowledge representation. We discuss these issues, and our often contrary experiences, throughout the paper.

Learning Case Classification for Improving Case-Based Reasoning this paper, we consider unconstrained graphs which may be either directed or undirected and, possibly, labelled or unlabelled. Computing structural similarity is essentially based on graph matching which actually means computing subgraph isomorphism. This subproblem is known to be NP-complete. It becomes more tractable when using labelled and directed graphs. The particular approach developed and investigated throughout the present workshop presentation can be easily generalized to other structural similarity concepts. For readability, we confine ourselves to graph representations. Because of NP-completeness of the subgraph isomorphism problem, classical case retrieval is extremely expensive, if every member of a usually huge case base is potentially queried. The performance of this search can be increased enormously by prestructuring the case base in case classes, i.e. clustering. Preferably, a given case base CB is clustered with respect to structural similarity, i.e. graphs of a close structural relationship are grouped together and represented by the graph(s) describing their common structural similarity. Let us assume that any given  case base CB is separated in n partitions or classes. Each class CB i (i = 1; :::; n) consists of a set of graph-represented cases and is determined by a graph \Theta

Multilevel Simulation and Numerical Optimization of Complex Engineering Designs Multilevel representations have been studied extensively by artificial intelligence researchers. We present a general method that utilizes the multilevel paradigm to attack the problem of performing multidiscipline engineering design optimization in the presence of many local optima. The method uses a multidisciplinary simulator at multiple levels of abstraction, paired with a multilevel search space. We tested the method in the domain of conceptual design of supersonic transport aircraft, focusing on the airframe and the exhaust nozzle, and using sequential quadratic programming as the optimizer at each level. We found that using multilevel simulation and optimization can decrease the cost of design space search by an order of magnitude. 1 Introduction  A major barrier to the use of gradient-based search methods for engineering design is that complex, multidisciplinary design spaces tend    An earlier version of this article was presented at 6  th  AIAA/NASA/USAF Multidisciplinary Ana...

Constructive Neural Network Learning Algorithms for Multi-Category Pattern Classification Constructive learning algorithms offer an attractive approach for the incremental construction of near-minimal neural-network architectures for pattern classification. They help overcome the need for ad hoc and often inappropriate choices of network topology in algorithms that search for suitable weights in a priori fixed network architectures. Several such algorithms are proposed in the literature and shown to converge to zero classification errors (under certain assumptions) on tasks that involve learning a binary to binary mapping (i.e., classification problems involving binary-valued input attributes and two output categories). We present two constructive learning algorithms MPyramid-real and MTiling-real that extend the pyramid and tiling algorithms, respectively, for learning real to M-ary mappings (i.e., classification problems involving real-valued input attributes and multiple output classes). We prove the convergence of these algorithms and empirically demonstrate their applicability to practical pattern classification problems. Additionally, we show how the incorporation of a local pruning step can eliminate several redundant neurons from MTiling-real networks.

Plans as Situated Action: An Activity Theory Approach to Workflow Systems : Within the community of CSCW the notion and nature of workflow systems as prescriptions of human work has been debated and criticised. Based on the work of Suchman (1987) the notion of situated action has often been viewed as opposed to planning work. Plans, however, do play an essential role in realising work. Based on experiences from designing a computer system that supports the collaboration within a hospital, this paper discusses how plans themselves are made out of situated action, and in return are realised in situ. Thus, work can be characterised as situated planning. This understanding is backed up by Activity Theory, which emphasises the connection between plans and the contextual conditions for realising these plans in actual work.  Introduction  The issue of workflow systems has been addressed by several authors as ways of routing information objects among users, and to specify automatic actions to be taken in that routing typically according to certain process models (Me...

A Language for Exchanging Agent UML Protocol Diagrams For several years, interaction protocol designers have a new formalism which takes into account multiagent system features: autonomy, cooperation, etc. This formalism is called Agent UML [6]. For the moment, designers can describe protocols with the Agent UML protocol diagrams but they do not have a textual language in order to exchange protocols or to check properties on them. The aim of this paper is to provide such a language. This language is called AXF (Agent UML eXchange Format) and is structured as an XML file. This paper presents the syntax of this language and applies AXF to the example of the English Auction Protocol. This paper is published as the technical report ULCS-02-009 from the department of computer science, University of Liverpool.

Traps - Classifiers Of Temporal Patterns The work proposes a radically different set of features for ASR where TempoRAl Patterns of spectral energies are used in place of the conventional spectral patterns. The approach has several inherent advantages, among them robustness to stationary or slowly varying disturbances.  1. INTRODUCTION 1.1. Spectral features  In 1665 Isaac Newton made the following observation:  'The filling of a very deepe flaggon with a constant streame of beere or water sounds yer vowells in this order w, u, !,  o, a, e, i, y' [8]. What young Newton observed was the spectral resonance peak which enhanced the spectrum of the beer pouring sound and moved up in frequency as the "deepe flaggon" was filling up. Since then, attempts to find acoustic correlates of phonetic categories mostly followed Newton's lead and studied the spectrum of speech. Spectrum-based techniques form the basis of most feature extraction methods in current ASR. A problem with the spectrum of sound is that it can easily be modified by v...

Invariant Fourier-Wavelet Descriptor For Pattern Recognition We present a novel set of descriptors for recognizing complex patterns such as roadsigns, keys, aircrafts, characters, etc. Given a pattern, we first transform it to polar coordinate (r; `) using the centre of mass of the pattern as origin. We then apply the Fourier transform along the axis of polar angle ` and the wavelet transform along the axis of radius r. The features thus obtained are invariant to translation, rotation, and scaling. As an example, we apply the method to a database of 85 printed Chinese characters. The result shows that the Fourier-Wavelet descriptor is an efficient representation which can provide for reliable recognition.

Key components of the system are a spider, an information extraction engine, a text classifier based on the Support Vector Machine that categorizes messages by subject, and a second classifier that analyzes which emotional state the author of a newsgroup posting was likely to be in. By analyzing large amount of messages, the system can summarize the main issues that are being reported on for given business sectors, and can summarize the emotional attitude of customers and shareholders towards companies.

Cooperative Multiagent Robotic Systems Introduction  Teams of robotic systems at first glance might appear to be more trouble than they are worth. Why not simply build one robot that is capable of doing everything we need? There are several reasons why two robots (or more) can be better than one:  ffl Distributed Action: Many robots can be in many places at the same time  ffl Inherent Parallelism: Many robots can do many, perhaps different things at the same time  ffl Divide and Conquer: Certain problems are well suited for decomposition and allocation among many robots  ffl Simpler is better: Often each agent in a team of robots can be simpler than a more comprehensive single robot solution No doubt there are more reasons as well. Unfortunately there are also drawbacks, in particular regarding coordination and elimination of interference. The degree of difficulty imposed depends heavily upon the task and the communication and control strategies chosen.

Distance Metrics and Indexing Strategies for a Digital Library of Popular Music Introduction  Digital libraries until now could hardly be described as popular: they tend to be based on esoteric, scholarly sources close to the interests of digital library researchers themselves. We are developing a digital library containing the quintessence of popular culture: music. The principal mode of searching this library will be by sung query: the system should be able to answer the kinds of queries that shop assistants in music stores deal with every day, where a customer can sing a tune, but can't remember the title or artist.  The operation of our musical digital library is sketched in Figure 1. At the time of collection creation, MIDI files are gathered from the internet, and indexed based on their note sequences. At retrieval time, a user's sung query is transformed from a waveform to a sequence of pitch-duration events by a pitch tracker.

Violation Contexts and Deontic Independence . In this paper we discuss the role of context and independence in normative reasoning. First, deontic operators -- obligations, prohibitions, permissions -- referring to the ideal context may conflict with operators referring to a violation (or contrary-to-duty) context. Second, deontic independence is a powerful concept to derive deontic operators from such operators of other violation contexts. These two concepts are used to determine how to proceed once a norm has been violated, a key issue of deontic logic applications in computer science. We also show how violation contexts and deontic independence can be used to give a new analysis of several notorious paradoxes of deontic logic. 1 Introduction  Deontic logic is a modal logic in which flp is read as `p ought to be (done),'  Fp as `p is forbidden to be (done)' and Pp as `p is permitted to be (done).' Deontic logic has traditionally been used by philosophers to analyze the structure of the normative use of language. In the eightie...

Query Optimization in the Presence of Limited Access Patterns 1 Introduction The goal of a query optimizer of a database system is to translate a declarative query expressed on a logical schema into an imperative query execution plan that accesses the physical storage of the data, and applies a sequence of relational operators. In building query execution plans, traditional relational query optimizers try to find the most efficient method for accessing the necessary data. When possible, a query optimizer will use auxiliary data structures such as an index on a file in order to efficiently retrieve a certain set of tuples in a relation. However, when such structures do not exist or are not useful for the given query, the alternative of scanning the entire relation always exists. The existence of the fall back option to perform a complete scan is an important assumption in traditional query optimization. Several recent query processing applications have the common characteristic that it is not always possible to perform complete scans on the data. Instead, the query optimization problem is complicated by the fact that there are only limited access patterns to the data. One such

Strongly Typed Inductive Concept Learning . In this paper we argue that the use of a language with a type system, together with higher-order facilities and functions, provides a suitable basis for knowledge representation in inductive concept learning and, in particular, illuminates the relationship between attribute-value learning and inductive logic programming (ILP). Individuals are represented by closed terms: tuples of constants in the case of attribute-value learning; arbitrarily complex terms in the case of ILP. To illustrate the point, we take some learning tasks from the machine learning and ILP literature and represent them in Escher, a typed, higher-order, functional logic programming language being developed at the University of Bristol. We argue that the use of a type system provides better ways to discard meaningless hypotheses on syntactic grounds and encompasses many ad hoc approaches to declarative bias. 1. Motivation and scope  Inductive concept learning consists of finding mappings of individuals (or objects...

Revisiting Rationality for Agents With Intentions Formal frameworks for the specification of autonomous agents are commonly based on logics of intention and belief. Desirable properties for logics of intention are particularly non-standard, even more so than for logics of belief. In this paper, we address problems with existing logics of intention and belief by shifting to a non-classical semantics, making use of Rantala's impossible, or non-normal, worlds. Our framework invalidates the problematic properties of intention and, by imposing certain constraints on the algebraic structure of the models, we show that that many desirable properties can be obtained. The non-normal worlds framework provides a fine-grained semantics and proves to be an extremely powerful and flexible tool for the logical specification of rational agent behaviour. 1.

Projective Translations and Affine Stereo Calibration This paper investigates the structure of projective translations - rigid translations expressed as homographies in projective space. A seven parameter representation is proposed, which explicitly represents the geometric entities constraining and defining the translation. A practical algebraic method for estimating these parameters is developed. It provides affine calibration of a stereo rig, determines the translation axis, and allows projective translations to be composed. The practical effectiveness of the calibration is evaluated on synthetic and real image data.  1 Introduction  The recovery of structure and motion is a basic problem in machine vision. The difficulties increase when uncalibrated cameras are considered, since in this case metric information is missing. Nevertheless, the rigidity of 3D-motions imposes strong consistency constraints. This allows metric information to be extracted. Mathematically, given a set of points reconstructed in projective space, the effect of ...

Using Transparent Props For Interaction With The Virtual Table The Virtual Table presents stereoscopic graphics to a user in a workbench-like setting. This paper reports on a user interface and new interaction techniques for the Virtual Table based on transparent props---a tracked hand-held pen and a pad. These props, but in particular the pad, are augmented with 3D graphics from the Virtual Table's display. This configuration creates a very powerful and flexible interface for two-handed interaction that can be applied to other back-projected stereographic displays as well: the pad can serve as a palette for tools and controls as well as a window-like see-through interface, a plane-shaped and throughthe -plane tool, supporting a variety of new interaction techniques. 1.

Automatic Construction of Intelligent Diagrammatic Environments Introduction  Graphical user interfaces have become an integral part of almost every modern application type and it can be claimed that they are among the driving forces that have made the computer accessible to non-expert users. However, comparing the use of graphics in existent user interfaces with that in non-computer-based work, the inadequacy of standard GUIs for complex visual communication is revealed: Most GUIs are still WIMP interfaces centered around such simple interaction devices like icons, buttons, menus or image maps. On the contrary, in non-computerbased work rich and highly structured graphical notations prevail.

Conflicts in a Simple Autonomy-Based Multi-Agent System This paper shows that, in some situations, conflict can deliberately be left in an autonomy-based multi-agent system. This study, supported by experimental results, has two major outcomes. First, it proves that conflict does not necessarily alter the global outcome of the system in a qualitative way. Second, it shows that it is possible to effect the way the global task is achieved by appropriately modifying the environment of the agents.

We began by observing air traffic controllers and their interactions with paper flight strips.

We argue that augmented reality is more promising (and simpler to implement) than the current strategies that seek to replace flight strips with keyboard/monitor interfaces.

Towards Detection of Human Motion Detecting humans in images is a useful application of computer vision. Loose and textured clothing, occlusion and scene clutter make it a difficult problem because bottom-up segmentation and grouping do not always work. We address the problem of detecting humans from their motion pattern in monocular image sequences; extraneous motions and occlusion may be present. We assume that we may not rely on segmentation, nor grouping and that the vision front-end is limited to observing the motion of key points and textured patches in between pairs of frames. We do not assume that we are able to track features for more than two frames. Our method is based on learning an approximate probabilistic model of the joint position and velocity of different body features. Detection is performed by hypothesis testing on the maximum a posteriori estimate of the pose and motion of the body. Our experiments on a dozen of walking sequences indicate that our algorithm is accurate and efficient.

Efficient Data and Program Integration Using Binding Patterns : In this work, we investigate data and program integration in a fully distributed peer-to-peer mediation architecture. The challenge in making such a system succeed at a large scale is twofold. First, sharing a resource should be easy; therefore, we need a simple concept for modeling resources. Second, we need an ecient architecture for distributed query execution, capable of handling well costly computations and large data transfers. To model heterogeneous resources, we propose using the unied abstraction of table with binding patterns, simple yet powerful enough to capture data and programs. To exploit a resource with restricted binding patterns, we propose an ecient BindJoin operator, following the classical iterator model, in which we build optimization techniques for minimizing large data transfers and costly computations, and maximizing parallelism. Furthermore, our BindJoin operator can be tuned to deliver most of its output in the early stages of the execution, which is an important asset in a system meant for human interaction. Our preliminary experimental evaluation validates the proposed BindJoin algorithms, and shows they can provide good performance in queries involving distributed data and expensive programs.

A Framework For Designing, Modeling and Analyzing Agent Based Software Systems The agent paradigm is gaining popularity because it brings intelligence, reasoning and autonomy to software systems. Agents are being used in an increasingly wide variety of applications from simple email filter programs to complex mission control and safety systems. However there appears to be very little work in defining practical software architecture, modeling and analysis tools that can be used by software engineers. This should be contrasted with object-oriented paradigm that is supported by models such as UML and CASE tools that aid during the analysis, design and implementation phases of object-oriented software systems. In our research we are developing a framework and extensions to UML to address this need. Our approach is rooted in the BDI formalism, but stresses the practical software design methods instead of reasoning about agents.

A Visual Interface for Human-Robot Interaction This paper describes the architecture of a human-robot interaction system and recent work on the vision based human-robot interface. The aim of the project is to develop a robotic system that is safely able to work with a human operator. This means in particular that the operator should be allowed into the work space of the robot and even to interact with the robot by direct contact with the manipulator. Safety issues are of major importance here, so open loop force control and backdrivability of the manipulator are mandatory features of the system. The human-robot interface is visionbased to achieve a natural interaction between the operator and the robot. Important aspects of this interaction are the ability of the vision system to find and track the operators face, to recognise facial gestures and to determine the users gaze point. These functions are implemented in a robust way so tracking failures can be compensated for and temporary occlusions of the face are tolerated. 1 Introdu...

Interacting At a Distance Using Semantic Snarfing . It is difficult to interact with computer displays that are across the  room, which can be important in meetings and when controlling computerized  devices. A popular approach is to use laser pointers tracked by a camera, but interaction  techniques using laser pointers tend to be imprecise, error-prone, and  slow. Therefore, we have developed a new interaction style, where the laser  pointer (or other pointing technique such pointing with a finger or even eye  tracking) indicates the region of interest, and then the item there is copied  ("snarfed") to the user's handheld device, such as a Palm or PocketPC handheld.  If the content changes on the PC, the handheld's copy will be updated as well.  Interactions can be performed on the handheld using familiar direct manipulation  techniques, and then the modified version is sent back to the PC. The content  often must be reformatted to fit the properties of the handheld to facilitate  natural interaction.  1

Querying the Uncertain Position of Moving Objects In this paper we propose a data model for representing moving objects with uncertain positions in database systems. It is called the Moving Objects Spatio-Temporal (MOST) data model. We also propose Future Temporal Logic (FTL) as the query language for the MOST model, and devise an algorithm for processing FTL queries in MOST. 1 Introduction  Existing database management systems (DBMS's) are not well equipped to handle continuously changing data, such as the position of moving objects. The reason for this is that in databases, data is assumed to be constant unless it is explicitly modified. For example, if the salary field is 30K, then this salary is assumed to hold (i.e. 30K is returned in response to queries) until explicitly updated. Thus, in order to represent moving objects (e.g. cars) in a database, and answer queries about their position (e.g., How far is the car with license plate RWW860 from the nearest hospital?) the car's position has to be continuously updated. This is unsa...

Compressive Computation in Analog VLSI Motion Sensors . We introduce several different focal plane analog VLSI motion sensors developed in the past. We show how their pixel-parallel architecture can be used to extract low-dimensional information from a higher dimensional data set. As an example we present an algorithm and corresponding experiments to compute the focus of expansion, focus of contraction and the axis of rotation from natural visual input. A fully integrated system for real-time computation of these quantities is proposed as well. In computer simulations it is shown that the direction of motion vector field is best suited to perform the algorithm even at high noise levels. 1 Analog VLSI Motion Sensors  In the past the computer vision communityhas invested much effort into developing motion detection algorithms; for a critical review see [BFB94]. Implementing these algorithms in real-time systems proved challenging for computational reasons. Additionally it has been realized that a motion vector field is useful mainly as star...

Collaborative Representations: Supporting Face to Face and Online Knowledge-building Discourse The present widespread interest in the use of electronic media for presents an unprecedented opportunity for leveraging the computational medium's strengths for learning. However, existing software tools provide only primitive support for online knowledge-building discourse. Further work is needed in supporting coordinated use of disciplinary representations, discourse representations, and knowledge representations. This paper introduces the concept of representational guidance for discourse along with results of an initial study of this phenomenon in face to face situations. The paper then considers the requirements for supporting asynchronous online knowledge-building discourse, finding existing computer mediated communication tools to be particularly deficient in supporting artifact-centered discourse. A solution is proposed that coordinates discourse representations with disciplinary and knowledge representations.  1. Introduction  There is a great deal of interest in the use of el...

HEMASL: A Flexible Language to Specify Heterogeneous Agents In the realization of agent-based applications the developer generally needs to use heterogeneous agent architectures, so that each application component can optimally perform its task. Languages that easily model the heterogeneity of agents' architectures are very useful in the early stages of the application development. This paper presents HEMASL, a simple meta-language used to specify heterogeneous agent architectures, and sketches how HEMASL should be implemented in an object-oriented commercial programming language as Java. Moreover, the paper briefly discusses the benefits of adding HEMASL to CaseLP, a LP-based specification and prototyping environment for multi-agent systems, in order to enhance its flexibility and usability.  1.

Democratic Data Fusion for Information Retrieval Mediators Our research presented in this paper concerns the problem of fusing the results returned by the underlying systems to a mediating retrieval system, also called meta-retrieval system, meta-search engine, or mediator. We propose a fusion technique which is based solely on the actual results returned by each system for each query. The final (fused) ordering of documents is derived by aggregating the orderings of each system in a democratic manner. In addition, the fused ordering is accompanied by a level of democracy (alternatively construed as the level of confidence).

Developing Haptic and Visual Perceptual Categories for Reaching and Grasping with a Humanoid Robot Properties of the human embodiment -- sensorimotor apparatus and neurological structure -- participate directly in the growth and development of cognitive processes against enormous worst case complexity. It is our position that relationships between morphology and perception over time lead to increasingly comprehensive models that describe the agent's relationship to the world. We are applying insight derived from neuroscience, neurology, and developmental psychology to the design of advanced robot architectures. To investigate developmental processes, we have begun to approximate the human sensorimotor configuration and to engage sensory and motor subsystems in developmental sequences. Many such sequences have been documented in studies of infant development, so we intend to bootstrap cognitive structures in robots by emulating some of these growth processes that bear an essential resemblance to the human morphology. In this paper, we will show two related examples in which a humanoid robot determines the models and representations that govern its behavior. The first is a model that captures the dynamics of a haptic exploration of an object with a dextrous robot hand that supports skillful grasping. The second example constructs constellations of visual features to predict relative hand/object postures that lead reliably to haptic utility. The result is a rst step in a trajectory toward associative visual-haptic categories that bounds the incremental complexity of each stage of development.

Assessment Methods for Information Quality Criteria Information quality (IQ) is one of the most important aspects of information integration on the Internet. Many projects realize and address this fact by gathering and classifying IQ criteria. Hardly ever do the projects address the immense difficulty of assessing scores for the criteria. This task must precede any usage of criteria for qualifying and integrating information.  After reviewing previous attempts to classify IQ criteria, in this paper we also classify criteria, but in a new, assessment-oriented way. We identify three sources for IQ scores and thus, three IQ criterion classes, each with different general assessment possibilities. Additionally, for each criterion we give detailed assessment methods. Finally, we consider confidence measures for these methods. Confidence expresses the accuracy, lastingness, and credibility of the individual assessment methods.  1 Introduction  Low information quality is one of the most pressing problems for consume rs of information that is di...

Exploring auction-based leveled-commitment contracting - Part I: English-type auctioning A key problem addressed in the area of multiagent systems is the automated  assignment of multiple tasks to executing agents. The automation  of multiagent task assignment requires that the individual agents (i) use  a common protocol that prescribes how they have to interact in order to  come to an agreement and (ii) fix their final agreement in a contract that  specifies the commitments resulting from the assignment on which they  agreed. This report describes a novel approach to automated task assignment  in multiagent systems that is based on an auction-based protocol  and on leveled commitment contracting. This approach is applicable in a  broad range of realistic scenarios in which knowledge-intensive negotiation  among agents is not feasible and in which future environmental changes  may require agents to breach their contracts.  1 Introduction  The area of multiagent systems (e.g., [5, 8, 16]), which is concerned with systems composed of technical entities called agents that in...

Theoretical Investigations And Experimental Explorations Of The Necessity Of User Guidance In Case-Based Knowledge Acquisition The intention of the present paper is to justify both theoretically and experimentally that user guidance is inevitable in case-based knowledge acquisition. The methodology of our approach is quite simple: We choose a well-understood area which is tailored to case-based knowledge acquisition. Furthermore, we choose a prototypical case-based learning algorithm which is obviously suitable for the problem domain under consideration. Then, we perform a number of knowledge acquisition experiments. They clearly exhibit essential limitations of knowledge acquisition from randomly chosen cases. As a consequence, we develop scenarios of user guidance. Based on these theoretical concepts, we prove a few theoretical results characterizing the power of our approach. Next, we perform a new series of more constrained results which support our theoretical investigations.

Version Management of XML Documents The problem of ensuring efficient storage and fast retrieval  for multi-version structured documents is important because of the recent  popularity of XML documents and semistructured information on  the web. Traditional document version control systems, e.g. RCS, which  model documents as a sequence of lines of text and use the shortest edit  script to represent version differences, can be inefficient and they do not  preserve the logical structure of the original document. Therefore, we propose  a new approach where the structure of the documents is preserved  intact, and their sub-objects are timestamped hierarchically for efficient  reconstruction of current and past versions. Our technique, called the  Usefulness Based Copy Control (UBCC), is geared towards efficient version  reconstruction while using small storage overhead. Our analysis and  experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the overall approach to version  control for structured documents. Moreover UBCC can easily support  multiple concurrent versions as well as partial document retrieval.  1

Learning Models of Other Agents Using Influence Diagrams We adopt decision theory as a descriptive paradigm to model rational agents. We use influence diagrams as a modeling representation of agents, which is used to interact with them and to predict their behavior. In this paper, we provide a framework that an agent can use to learn the models of other agents in a multi-agent system (MAS) based on their observed behavior. Since the correct model is usually not known with certainty our agents maintain a number of possible models and assign a probability to each of them being correct. When none of the available models is likely to be correct, we modify one of them to better account for the observed behaviors. The modification refines the parameters of the influence diagram used to model the other agent's capabilities, preferences, or beliefs. The modified model is then allowed to compete with the other models and the probability assigned to it being correct can be arrived at based on how well it predicts the behaviors of the other agent alrea...

Discriminant Analysis based Feature Extraction We propose a new feature extraction scheme called  Discriminant Component Analysis. The new scheme decomposes a signal into orthonormal bases such that for each base there is an eigenvalue representing the discriminatory power of projection in that direction. The bases and eigenvalues are obtained based on certain classification criterion. For simplicity, a criterion used in Fisher's Discriminant Analysis (DA) is chosen and is applied iteratively to implement the scheme. We illustrate the motivation of this new scheme and show how it can be used to construct new distance metrics. We then argue that these new distance metrics are more robust than DA based metrics. Finally, very good classification performance on simulation data and real face images are demonstrated using these new distance metrics.  1 Introduction  It is important that for different applications, we use different representations for the same signal [1].

Process-Oriented Estimation of Generalization Error Methods to avoid overfitting fall into two broad  categories: data-oriented (using separate data  for validation) and representation-oriented (penalizing  complexity in the model). Both have  limitations that are hard to overcome. We  argue that fully adequate model evaluation is  only possible if the search process by which  models are obtained is also taken into account.  To this end, we recently proposed a method  for process-oriented evaluation (POE), and successfully  applied it to rule induction [ Domingos,  1998b ] . However, for the sake of simplicity this  treatment made a number of rather artificial assumptions.  In this paper the assumptions are  removed, and a simple formula for error estimation  is obtained. Empirical trials show the  new, better-founded form of POE to be as accurate  as the previous one, while further reducing  theory sizes.  1 Introduction  Overfitting avoidance is a central problem in machine learning.

The algorithm iteratively labels the entire data set with parse trees. Using empirical results based on parsing the Wall Street Journal corpus we show that training a statistical parser on the combined labeled and unlabeled data strongly outperforms training only on the labeled data. 1

Using Web Structure for Classifying and Describing Web Pages The structure of the web is increasingly being used to improve organization, search, and analysis  of information on the web. For example, Google uses the text in citing documents (documents that  link to the target document) for search. We analyze the relative utility of document text, and the text  in citing documents near the citation, for classification and description. Results show that the text in  citing documents, when available, often has greater discriminative and descriptive power than the text  in the target document itself. The combination of evidence from a document and citing documents  can improve on either information source alone. Moreover, by ranking words and phrases in the citing  documents according to expected entropy loss, we are able to accurately name clusters of web pages,  even with very few positive examples. Our results confirm, quantify, and extend previous research using  web structure in these areas, introducing new methods for classification and description of pages.

Co-clustering documents and words using Bipartite Spectral Graph Partitioning Both document clustering and word clustering are important and well-studied problems. By using the vector space model, a document collection may be represented as a word-document matrix. In this paper, we present the novel idea of modeling the document collection as a bipartite graph between documents and words. Using this model, we pose the clustering probliem as a graph partitioning problem and give a new spectral algorithm that simultaneously yields a clustering of documents and words. This co-clustrering algorithm uses the second left and right singular vectors of an appropriately scaled word-document matrix to yield good bipartitionings. In fact, it can be shown that these singular vectors give a real relaxation to the optimal solution of the graph bipartitioning problem. We present several experimental results to verify that the resulting co-clustering algoirhm works well in practice and is robust in the presence of noise.

From the Specification of Multiagent Systems by Statecharts to Their Formal Analysis by Model Checking: Towards Safety-Critical Applications A formalism for the specification of multiagent systems should be expressive  and illustrative enough to model not only the behavior of one single agent, but  also the collaboration among several agents and the influences caused by external  events from the environment. For this, state machines [25] seem to provide an  adequate means. Furthermore, it should be easily possible to obtain an implementation  for each agent automatically from this specification. Last but not least, it is  desirable to be able to check whether the multiagent system satisfies some interesting  properties. Therefore, the formalism should also allow for the verification  or formal analysis of multiagent systems, e.g. by model checking [6].  In this paper, a framework is introduced, which allows us to express declarative  aspects of multiagent systems by means of (classical) propositional logic  and procedural aspects of these systems by means of state machines (statecharts).  Nowadays statecharts are a well accepted means to specify dynamic behavior of  software systems. They are a part of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). We  describe in a rigorously formal manner, how the specification of spatial knowledge  and robot interaction and its verification by model checking can be done,  integrating different methods from the field of artificial intelligence such as qualitative  (spatial) reasoning and the situation calculus. As example application domain,  we will consider robotic soccer, see also [24, 31], which present predecessor  work towards a formal logic-based approach for agents engineering.

Using the amdb access method analysis tool, we analyze three existing multidimensional access methods that support nearest neighbor search in the context of the Blobworld application. Based on this analysis, we propose several variants of the R-tree, tailored to address the problems the analysis revealed.

This requires a speech recognition system in the language in which audio is provided to get the time alignment for the phonetic sequence of the audio signal. However, building a speech recognition system is data intensive and is a very tedious and time consuming task.

Monte Carlo Localization: Efficient Position Estimation for Mobile Robots This paper presents a new algorithm for mobile robot localization, called Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). MCL is a version of Markov localization, a family of probabilistic approaches that have recently been applied with great practical success. However, previous approaches were either computationally cumbersome (such as grid-based approaches that represent the state space by high-resolution 3D grids), or had to resort to extremely coarse-grained resolutions. Our approach is computationally efficient while retaining the ability to represent (almost) arbitrary distributions. MCL applies sampling-based methods for approximating probability distributions, in a way that places computation " where needed." The number of samples is adapted on-line, thereby invoking large sample sets only when necessary. Empirical results illustrate that MCL yields improved accuracy while requiring an order of magnitude less computation when compared to previous approaches. It is also much easier to implement...

Transforming Paper Documents into XML Format with WISDOM++ The transformation of scanned paper documents to a form suitable for an Internet browser is a complex process that requires solutions to several problems. The application of an OCR to some parts of the document image is only one of the problems. In fact, the generation of documents in HTML format is easier when the layout structure of a page has been extracted by means of a document analysis process. The adoption of an XML format is even better, since it can facilitate the retrieval of documents in the Web. Nevertheless, an effective transformation of paper documents into this format requires further processing steps, namely document image classification and understanding.

Goal Creation in Motivated Agents . Goal creation is an important consideration for an agent that is required to behave autonomously in a real-world domain. This paper describes an agent that is directed, not by a conjunction of top level goals, but by a set of motives. The agent is motivated to create and prioritise different goals at different times as a part of an on-going activity under changing circumstances. Goals can be created both in reaction to, and in anticipation of a situation. While there has been much work on the creation of reactive goals, i.e. goals created in reaction to a situation, the issues involved in the creation of anticipatory, or proactive goals have not been considered in depth. The solution to the goal creation problem outlined here provides an agent with an effective method of creating goals both reactively and proactively, giving the agent a greater degree of autonomy. 1 Introduction  The focus of planning research has principally been concerned with the creation of good plans to satisfy ...

Smartcards are used as secure containers for digital certificates. The system is implemented in Java and we use Extensible Markup Language as the sole medium for communications and data exchange. Currently, we are solely dependent on a base set of access rights for our distributed trust model however, we are expanding the model to include the delegation of rights based upon a predefined policy. In our proposed expansion, instead of exclusively relying on predefined access rights, we have developed a flexible representation of trust information, in Prolog, that can model permissions, obligations, entitlements, and prohibitions. In this paper, we present the implementation of our system and describe the modifications to the design that are required to further enhance distributed trust. Our implementation is applicable to any distributed service infrastructure, whether the infrastructure is wired, mobile, or ad-hoc.

Integration of Machine Learning and Knowledge Acquisition Introduction  "Integration of Machine Learning and Knowledge Acquisition" may be a surprising title for an ECAI-94 workshop since most Machine Learning (ML) systems are dedicated to Knowledge Acquisition (KA). What could thus mean integrating ML and KA ? The answer lies in the difference between the approaches developed by what is referred to as ML and KA research. Apart from some major exceptions, such as learning apprentice tools [ Mitchell et al., 1989 ] , or libraries like Machine Learning Toolbox [ MLT, 1993 ] , most ML algorithms were described without any characterization in terms of real application needs, in term of what they could be effectively useful for. However, ML methods were applied to "real world" problems, but few general and reusable conclusions were drawn from these knowledge acquisition experiments. As ML techniques become more and more sophisticated and able to produce various forms of knowledge, the number of possible applications grows.

Studying Robot Social Cognition Within A Developmental Psychology Framework This paper discusses two prominent theories of cognitive development and relates them to experiments in social robotics. The main difference between these theories lies in the different views on the relationship between a child and its social environment: a) the child as a solitary thinker (Piaget) and b) the child in society (Vygotsky). We discuss the implications this has on the design of socially intelligent agents, focusing on robotic agents. We argue that the framework proposed by Vygotsky provides a promising research direction in autonomous agents. We give examples of implementations in the area of social robotics which support our theoretical considerations. More specifically, we demonstrate how a teacher-learner setup can be used to teach a robot a proto-language. The same control architecture is also used for a humanoid doll robot which can interact with a human by imitation. Another experiment addresses dynamic coupling of movements between a human and a mobile robot. Here, ...

Data Mining on an OLTP System (Nearly) for Free This paper proposes a scheme for scheduling disk requests that takes advantage of the ability of high-level functions to operate directly at individual disk drives. We show that such a scheme makes it possible to support a Data Mining workload on an OLTP system almost for free: there is only a small impact on the throughput and response time of the existing workload. Specifically, we show that an OLTP system has the disk resources to consistently provide one third of its sequential bandwidth to a background Data Mining task with close to zero impact on OLTP throughput and response time at high transaction loads. At low transaction loads, we show much lower impact than observed in previous work. This means that a production OLTP system can be used for Data Mining tasks without the expense of a second dedicated system. Our scheme takes advantage of close interaction with the on-disk scheduler by reading blocks for the Data Mining workload as the disk head ‚Äúpasses over ‚Äù them while satisfying demand blocks from the OLTP request stream. We show that this scheme provides a consistent level of throughput for the background workload even at very high foreground loads. Such a scheme is of most benefit in combination with an Active Disk environment that allows the background Data Mining application to also take advantage of the processing power and memory available directly on the disk drives.

Comprehensive Hardware and Software Support for Operating Systems to Exploit MP Memory Hierarchies Abstract√êHigh-performance multiprocessor workstations are becoming increasingly popular. Since many of the workloads running on these machines are operating-system intensive, we are interested in exploring the types of support for the operating system that the memory hierarchy of these machines should provide. In this paper, we evaluate a comprehensive set of hardware and software supports that minimize the performance losses for the operating system in a sophisticated cache hierarchy. These supports, selected from recent papers, are code layout optimization, guarded sequential instruction prefetching, instruction stream buffers, support for block operations, support for coherence activity, and software data prefetching. We evaluate these supports under a simulated environment. We show that they have a largely complementary impact and that, when combined, speed up the operating system by an average of 40 percent. Finally, a cost-performance comparison of these schemes suggests that the most cost-effective ones are code layout optimization and block operation support, while the least cost-effective one is software data prefetching. Index Terms√êCache hierarchies, shared-memory multiprocessors, architectural support for operating system, prefetching, tracedriven simulations, performance, block operations. 1

Adaptation and Plasticity of User Interfaces . This paper introduces the notion of plasticity, a new property of interactive systems that denotes a particular type of user interface adaptation. It also presents a generic framework inspired from the model-based approach, for supporting the development of plastic user interfaces. This framework is illustrated with simple case studies.  KEYSWORDS. User interface adaptation, plasticity.  1. Introduction: A Design Space for Adaptation  In HCI, adaptation is modeled as two complementary system properties: adaptability and adaptivity. Adaptability is the capacity of the system to allow users to customize their system from a predefined set of parameters. Adaptivity is the capacity of the system to perform adaptation automatically without deliberate action from the user's part. Whether adaptation is performed on human requests or automatically, the design space for adaptation includes three additional orthogonal axes (see Figure 1):  . The target for adaptation.

Designing a Miniature Wearable Visual Robot In this paper we report on two methods we have developed to aid in the design of a Wearable Visual Robot --- a body mounted robot for which the main sensor is a camera. Specifically, we have first refined the analysis of sensor placement through the computation of the field of view and body motion using a 3D model of the human form. Second we have improved the design of the robot's morphology with the help of an optimization algorithm based on the Pareto front, within constraints set by the overall choice of robot kinematic chain and the need to specify obtainable actuators and sensors. The methods could be of use for the design and performance evaluation of rather different kinds of wearable robots and devices.

A Framework for Describing Visual Interfaces to Databases In the field of HCI there exist many formalisms for analysing, describing and evaluating interactive systems. However, in developing and evaluating user interfaces to databases, we found it necessary to be able to describe presentation and interaction aspects that are catered for poorly or not at all in current formalisms. This paper presents a framework for the systematic description of data model, presentation and interaction components that together form a graphical user interface. The utility of the framework is then demonstrated by showing how it can be used to describe two existing visual query interfaces. These examples show that the framework provides a systematic method for the concise description of graphical interfaces to databases that can be used either during interface design or as a communication aid. 1 Introduction  Research in user interfaces for databases is gaining momentum with many recent conferences and workshops [10, 21, 22, 23, 36].

Flexible and Scalable Cost-Based Query Planning in Mediators: A Transformational Approach The Internet provides access to a wealth of information. For any given topic or application domain there are a variety of available information sources. However, current systems, such as search engines or topic directories in the World Wide Web, offer only very limited capabilities for locating, combining, and organizing information. Mediators, systems that provide integrated access and database-like query capabilities to information distributed over heterogeneous sources, are critical to realize the full potential of meaningful access to networked information.  Query planning, the task of generating a cost-efficient plan that computes a user query from the relevant information sources, is central to mediator systems. However, query planning is a computationally hard problem due to the large number of possible sources and possible orderings on the operations to process the data. Moreover, the choice of sources, data processing operations, and their ordering, strongly affects the plan c...

On the Equivalence of the Static and Disjunctive Well-Founded Semantics and its Computation In recent years, much work was devoted to the study of theoretical foundations of Disjunctive Logic Programming and Disjunctive Deductive Databases. While the semantics of non-disjunctive programs is fairly well understood, the declarative and computational foundations of disjunctive logic programming proved to be much more elusive and difficult. Recently, two new and promising semantics have been proposed for the class of disjunctive logic programs. The first one is the static semantics STATIC, proposed by Przymusinski, and, the other is the disjunctive well-founded semantics D-WFS, proposed by Brass and Dix.  Although the two semantics are based on very different ideas, both of them have been shown to share a number of natural and intuitive properties. In particular, both Preprint submitted to Elsevier Preprint 4 October 1999 of them extend the well-founded semantics of normal logic programs. Nevertheless, since the static semantics employs a much richer underlying language than the ...

Landscapes on Spaces of Trees Combinatorial optimization problems defined on sets of phylogenetic trees are an important issue in computational biology, for instance the problem of reconstruction a phylogeny using maximum likelihood or parsimony approaches. The collection of possible phylogenetic trees is arranged as a so-called Robinson graph by means of the nearest neighborhood interchange move. The coherent algebra and spectra of Robinson graphs are discussed in some detail as their knowledge is important for an understanding of the landscape structure. We consider simple model landscapes as well as landscapes arising from the maximum parsimony problem, focusing on two complementary measures of ruggedness: the amplitude spectrum arising from projecting the cost functions onto the eigenspaces of the underlying graph and the topology of local minima and their connecting saddle points.

Leveled Commitment and Trust in Negotiation As agents become more autonomous, agent negotiation and motivational attitudes such as commitment  and trust become more important. In this paper we consider the important choice in advanced  negotiation applications whether negotiation parameters -- such as cardinality of interaction, agent attitude,  and agent architectures -- are incorporated in the negotiation protocol or in the negotiation strategy.  Only in the first case parameters are fixed and agents do not have to reason about them when they choose  their strategy. We define a dynamic deontic logic which can also be used for the second case, because it  models concepts like leveled commitment and trust. For example, it formalizes that violating commitments  leads to a decrease in trustworthiness.  1 Introduction  In advanced applications of multi-agent systems agents interact more frequently, deliberate more extensively, and in general act more autonomously.

Classifying Unseen Cases with Many Missing Values Handling missing attribute values is an important issue for classifier learning, since missing attribute values in either training data or test (unseen) data affect the prediction accuracy of learned classifiers. In many real KDD applications, attributes with missing values are very common. This paper studies the robustness of four recently developed committee learning techniques, including Boosting, Bagging, Sasc, and SascMB, relative to C4.5 for tolerating missing values in test data. Boosting is found to have a similar level of robustness to C4.5 for tolerating missing values in test data in terms of average error in a representative collection of natural domains under investigation. Bagging performs slightly better than Boosting, while Sasc and SascMB perform better than them in this regard, with  SascMB performing best. Furthermore, we propose a novel voting weight scheme for the committee learning techniques. Although it is very simple, it can improve the robustness of all these ...

The Conference Assistant: Combining Context-Awareness with Wearable Computing We describe the Conference Assistant, a prototype mobile, context-aware application that assists conference attendees. We discuss the strong relationship between context-awareness and wearable computing and apply this relationship in the Conference Assistant.

We describe how the application is used and the context-aware architecture on which it is based. 1. Introduction  In human-human interaction, a great deal of information is conveyed without explicit communication, but rather by using cues. These shared cues, or context,  help to facilitate grounding between participants in an interaction [3].

Deductive Queries in ODMG Databases: the DOQL Approach The Deductive Object Query Language (DOQL) is a rule-based query  language designed to provide recursion, aggregates, grouping and virtual  collections in the context of an ODMG compliant object database system.  This paper provides a description of the constructs supported by DOQL  and the algebraic operational semantics induced by DOQL's query translation  approach to implementation. The translation consists of a logical  rewriting step used to normalise DOQL expressions into molecular forms,  and a mapping step that transforms the canonical molecular form into  algebraic expressions. The paper thus not only describes a deductive  language for use with ODMG databases, but indicates how this language  can be implemented using conventional query processing techniques.  1 Introduction  The ODMG standard is an important step forward due to the provision of a reference architecture for object databases.

Conjunctive-Query Containment and Constraint Satisfaction Conjunctive-query containment is recognized as a fundamental problem in database query evaluation and optimization. At the same time, constraint satisfaction is recognized as a fundamental problem in artificial intelligence. What do conjunctive-query containment and constraint satisfaction have in common? Our main conceptual contribution in this paper is to point out that, despite their very different formulation, conjunctive-query containment and constraint satisfaction are essentially the same problem. The reason is that they can be recast as the following fundamental algebraic problem: given two finite relational structures A and B, is there a homomorphism h : A ! B? As formulated above, the homomorphism problem is uniform in the sense that both relational structures A and B are part of the input. By fixing the structure B, one obtains the following non-uniform problem: given a finite relational structure A, is there a homomorphism h : A ! B? In general, non-uniform tractability results do not uniformize. Thus, it is natural to ask: which tractable cases of non-uniform tractability results for constraint satisfaction and conjunctive-query containment do uniformize? Our main technical contribution in this paper is to show that several cases of tractable non-uniform constraint satisfaction problems do indeed uniformize. We exhibit three non-uniform tractability results that uniformize and, thus, give rise to polynomial-time solvable cases of constraint satisfaction and conjunctive-query containment.

How to Interpret Neural Networks In Terms of Fuzzy Logic? Neural networks are a very efficient learning tool, e.g., for transforming an experience of an expert human controller into the design of an automatic controller. It is desirable to reformulate the neural network expression for the input-output function in terms most understandable to an expert controller, i.e., by using words from natural language. There are several methodologies for transforming such natural-language knowledge into a precise form; since these methodologies have to take into consideration the uncertainty (fuzziness) of natural language, they are usually called fuzzy logics.  1

Adaptive Query Processing for Internet Applications As the area of data management for the Internet has gained in popularity, recent work has focused on effectively dealing with unpredictable, dynamic data volumes and transfer rates using adaptive query processing techniques. Important requirements of the Internet domain include: (1) the ability to process XML data as it streams in from the network, in addition to working on locally stored data; (2) dynamic scheduling of operators to adjust to I/O delays and flow rates; (3) sharing and re-use of data across multiple queries, where possible; (4) the ability to output results and later update them. An equally important consideration is the high degree of variability in performance needs for different query processing domains: perhaps an ad-hoc query application should optimize for display of incomplete and partial incremental results, whereas a corporate data integration application may need the best time-to-completion and may have very strict data "freshness" guarantees.

TxnWrap: A Transactional Approach to Data Warehouse Maintenance A Data Warehouse Management System (DWMS) maintains materialized views derived from one or more information sources (ISs) under source changes. Much recent research has developed maintenance algorithms to achieve data warehouse consistency under source data updates typically by sending additional compensation-based messages to information source space. Given the highly dynamic nature of modern distributed environments such as the WWW, both source data or schema changes are likely to occur autonomously and even concurrently. Most previous solutions become invalid under this new requirement, causing both wrong query results returned from IS space or even complete rejection messages. This paper now proposes to tackle this problem from a different angle by rephasing it as a global distributed transaction problem, and develops a novel solution strategy that is not only handling this as of now unsolved problem of concurrent source shcmea changes but also added benefit is more efficient than previous solutions from the literature. As foundation of our solution, we encapsulate the complete data warehouse maintenance process as a DWMS Transaction. We design a multiversion timestamp source wrapper materialization and associated concurrency control algorithm that guarantees a consistent view of the information source space data inside each DWMS Transaction, thus removing the maintenance anomaly problem. This integrated solution called TxnWrap is proven to be correct and achieve complete consistency of data warehouse maintenance even under a mixture of concurrent data updates or schema changes. TxnWrap is complementary to previous maintenance algorithms of removing their concurrency considerations. We have implemented TxnWrap and plugged it into an existing DWMS testbed...

Experiences Using Case-Based Reasoning to Predict Software Project Effort This paper explores some of the practical issues associated with the use of case-based reasoning (CBR) or estimation by analogy. We note that different research teams have reported widely differing results with this technology. Whilst we accept that underlying characteristics of the datasets being used play a major role we also argue that configuring a CBR system can also have an impact. We examine the impact of the choice of number of analogies when making predictions; we also look at different adaptation strategies. Our analysis is based on a dataset of software projects collected by a Canadian software house. Our results show that choosing analogies is important but adaptation strategy appears to be less so. These findings must be tempered, however, with the finding that it was difficult to show statistical significance for smaller datasets even when the accuracy indicators differed quite substantially. For this reason we urge some degree of caution when comparing competing predicti...

A Logical Framework for Multi-Agent Systems and Joint Attitudes We present a logical framework for reasoning about multi-agent systems. This framework uses Giunchiglia et al.'s notion of a logical context to define a methodology for the modular specification of agents and systems of agents. In particular, the suggested methodology possesses important features from the paradigm of object-oriented (OO) design. We are particularly interested in the specification of agent behaviours via BDI theories---i.e., theories of belief, desire and intention. We explore various issues arising from the BDI specification of systems of agents and illustrate how our framework can be used to specify bottom-level agent behaviour via the specification of top-level intentions, or to reason about complex "emergent behaviour" by specifying the relationship between simple interacting agents.  1 Introduction  The formal specification of autonomous reasoning agents has recently received much attention in the AI community, particular under the paradigm of agent-oriented progr...

Going beyond Mobile Agent Platforms: Component-Based Development of Mobile Agent Systems Although mobile agents are a promising programming paradigm, the actual deployment of this technology in real applications has been far away from what the researchers were expecting. One important reason for this is the fact that in the current mobile agent frameworks it is quite difficult to develop applications without having to center them on the mobile agents and on the agent platforms. In this paper, we present a component-based framework that enables ordinary applications to use mobile agents in an easy and flexible way. By using this approach, applications can be developed using current objectoriented approaches and become able of sending and receiving agents by the simple drag-and-drop of mobility components. The framework was implemented using the JavaBeans component model and provides integration with ActiveX, which allows applications to be written in a wide variety of programming languages. By using this framework, the development of applications that can make use of mobile agents is greatly simplified, which can contribute to a wider spreading of the mobile agent technology.

Real-time Analysis of Data from Many Sensors with Neural Networks Much research has been conducted that uses sensorbased modules with dedicated software to automatically distinguish the user's situation or context. The best results were obtained when powerful sensors (such as cameras or GPS systems) and/or sensor-specific algorithms (like sound analysis) were applied. A  somewhat new approach is to replace the one smart sensor by many simple sensors. We argue that neural networks are ideal algorithms to analyze the data coming from these sensors and describe how we came to one specific algorithm that gives good results, by giving an overview of several requirements. Finally, wearable implementations are given to show the feasibility and benefits of this approach and its implications.  1.

Finding and Moving Constraints in Cyberspace Agent-based architectures are an effective method for constructing open, dynamic, distributed information systems. The KRAFT system exploits such an architecture, focusing on the exchange of information --- in the form of constraints and data --- among participating agents. The KRAFT approach is particularly wellsuited to solving design and configuration problems, in which constraints and data are retrieved from agents representing customers and vendors on an extranet network, transformed to a common ontology, and processed by mediator agents. This paper describes the KRAFT system, discusses the issues involved in joining a KRAFT network from the point-of-view of information providers in Cyberspace, and examines the role of autonomous and mobile agents in KRAFT.

From Active Objects to Autonomous Agents This paper studies how to extend the concept of active objects  into a structure of agents. It first discusses the requirements for autonomous  agents that are not covered by simple active objects. We  propose then the extension of the single behavior of an active object  into a set of behaviors with a meta-behavior scheduling their activities.  To make a concrete proposal based on these ideas we describe how we  extended a framework of active objects, named Actalk, into a generic  multi-agent platform, named DIMA. We discuss how this extension  has been implemented. We finally report on one application of DIMA  to simulate economic models.

Efficient Management of Multiversion Documents by Object Referencing Traditional approaches to versioning semistructured information are edit-based, i.e., subsequent document versions are represented by using edit scripts. This paper proposes a reference-based version management scheme that preserves the logical structure of the evolving document through the use of object references. By preserving the document structure among versions the new scheme facilitates more efficient query support. In particular, we examine queries involving projections and selections on the document versions, as well as queries on the document evolution history. Moreover, we show that the proposed scheme provides an effective representation of multiversioned XML documents, both at the transport and exchange levels. In fact, with the reference-based scheme, a document's history can also be viewed and processed as yet another XML document. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the new scheme at the storage level. In particular, the scheme is enhanced with a usefulness-based page management policy that extends and adapts techniques used in transaction-time databases to ensure efficient clustering of information among versions. An extensive comparison of the reference-based versioning against representations used in temporal databases and persistent object managers depicts the performance advantages of the new approach. Finally it should be noted that reference-based versioning is applicable to other kinds of semistructured information (besides XML documents), and can be used to replace traditional version control schemes, such as the edit-based RCS and the timestamp-based SCCS.

ANSWER: Network Monitoring Using Object-Oriented Rules This paper describes ANSWER, the expert system  responsible for monitoring AT&T's 4ESS switches. These switches are extremely important, since they handle virtually all of AT&T's long distance traffic. ANSWER is implemented in R++, a rule-based extension to the C++ object-oriented programming language, and is innovative  because it employs both rule-based and object-oriented programming paradigms. The use of object technology in ANSWER has provided a principled way of modeling the 4ESS and of reasoning about failures within the 4ESS. This has resulted in an expert system that is more clearly organized, easily understood and maintainable than its predecessor, which was implemented using the rule-based paradigm alone. ANSWER has been deployed for more than a year and handles all 140 of AT&T's 4ESS switches and processes over 100,000 4ESS alarms per week. Introduction  Network reliability is of critical concern to AT&T, since its reputation for network reliability has taken many years to ...

Accessing Data Integration Systems through Conceptual Schemas Data integration systems provide access to a set of heterogeneous,  autonomous data sources through a so-called global, or mediated  view. There is a general consensus that the best way to describe the global  view is through a conceptual data model, and that there are basically two  approaches for designing a data integration system. In the global-as-view  approach, one defines the concepts in the global schema as views over  the sources, whereas in the local-as-view approach, one characterizes the  sources as views over the global schema. It is well known that processing  queries in the latter approach is similar to query answering with incomplete  information, and, therefore, is a complex task. On the other hand,  it is a common opinion that query processing is much easier in the former  approach. In this paper we show the surprising result that, when the  global schema is expressed in terms of a conceptual data model, even a  very simple one, query processing becomes di#cult in the global-as-view  approach also. We demonstrate that the problem of incomplete information  arises in this case too, and we illustrate some basic techniques for  e#ectively answering queries posed to the global schema of the data integration  system.  1

Soft Margins for AdaBoost Recently ensemble methods like AdaBoost have been applied successfully in many problems, while seemingly defying the problems of overfitting. AdaBoost rarely overfits in the low noise regime, however, we show that it clearly does so for higher noise levels. Central to the understanding of this fact is the margin distribution. AdaBoost can be viewed as a constraint gradient descent in an error function with respect to the margin. We find that AdaBoost asymptotically achieves a hard margin distribution, i.e. the algorithm concentrates its resources on a few hard-to-learn patterns that are interestingly very similar to Support Vectors. A hard margin is clearly a sub-optimal strategy in the noisy case, and regularization, in our case a ``mistrust'' in the data, must be introduced in the algorithm to alleviate the distortions that single difficult patterns (e.g. outliers) can cause to the margin distribution. We propose several regularization methods and generalizations of the original AdaBoost algorithm to achieve a soft margin. In particular we suggest (1) regularized AdaBoost-Reg where the gradient decent is done directly with respect to the soft margin and (2) regularized linear and quadratic programming (LP/QP-) AdaBoost, where the soft margin is attained by introducing slack variables. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed regularized AdaBoost-type algorithms are useful and yield competitive results for noisy data.

Integrity Constraints and Constraint Logic Programming It is shown that constraint logic is useful for evaluation of integrity constraints in deductive databases. Integrity constraints are represented as calls to a metainterpreter for negation-as-failure implemented as a constraint solver. This procedure, called lazy negationas -failure, yields an incremental evaluation: It starts checking the existing database and each time an update request occurs, simplified constraints are produced for checking the particular update and new constraints corresponding to specialized integrity constraints are generated for the updated database. 1 Introduction  There is a relationship between integrity constraints in databases and the constraints of constraint logic programming going beyond the partial overlap of the names applied for these phenomena. Both concern conditions that should be ensured for systems of interdependent entities: the different tuples in a database, and the set of variables in a program execution state. Both relate to problems that e...

QLB: A Quantified Logic for Belief . This paper describes QLB, a quantified logic of belief that is a possible extension of the modal system KD45n to predicate level. The main features of QLB are that: (i) it is allowed to quantify over the agents of belief; (ii) the belief operator can be indexed by any term of the formal language; (iii) terms are not rigid designators, but are interpreted contextually; (iv) automatic theorem proving is possible in QLB (but it is not presented in this paper). QLB is constructed as a partial logic with a monotonic semantics on ordered sets, and its semantic theorems are defined as the formulae that are sometimes true and never false. 1 Introduction  Agents are complex objects: they can be modelled in terms of mental states, like knowledge, beliefs, intentions, goals, plans, etc. and they perform actions (sometimes cooperatively) in a society of other agents.

Generic Agent Framework for Internet Information Systems For effective Internet database services, it is essential that the information requirements of regular users can be met without the typical delays currently experienced using Internet browsers and the World Wide Web. We use cooperating agents to manage both client and server caches, thereby bringing significant performance improvements. The caching and prefetching of information is based on both user and application profiles and agents communicate to ensure the currency of client caches. According to specific application requirements, various forms of agents can be installed on the server and client sides to provide value-added services to both casual and regular users. All component agents are instantiations and/or specialisations of a generic agent. We describe how a specific Internet brokering system for engineering product data has been constructed using our general framework for the development of Internet information systems. 1 Introduction With the development of World-Wide Web ...

Toward Scalable Learning with Non-uniform Class and Cost Distributions: A Case Study in Credit Card Fraud Detection Many factors influence the performance of a learned classifier. In this paper we study different methods of measuring performance based on a unified set of cost models and the effects of training class distribution with respect to these models. Observations from these effects help us devise a distributed multi-classifier meta-learning approach to learn in domains with skewed class distributions, non-uniform cost per error, and large amounts of data. One such domain is credit card fraud detection and our empirical results indicate that, up to a certain degree of skewed distribution, our approach can significantly reduce loss due to illegitimate transactions. Introduction  Inductive learning research has been focusing on devising algorithms that generate highly accurate classifiers. Many factors contribute to the quality of the learned classifier. One factor is the class distribution in the training set. Using the same algorithm, different training class distributions can generate classi...

Engineering Executable Agents Using Multi-Context Systems In the area of agent-based computing there are many proposals for specific system architectures, and a number of proposals for general approaches to building agents. As yet, however, there are comparatively few attempts to relate these together, and even fewer attempts to provide methodologies which relate designs to architectures and then to executable agents. This paper provides a first attempt to address this shortcoming. We propose a general method of specifying logic-based agents, which is based on the use of multi-context systems, and give examples of its use. The resulting specifications can be directly executed, and we discuss an implementation which makes this direct execution possible.

We discuss graph decomposition schemes used to break up the problem into several pieces of manageable dimensions. A semiexternal greedy randomized adaptive search procedure (GRASP) for finding approximate solutions to the maximum clique problem and maximum quasiclique problem in very large sparse graphs is presented. We experiment with this heuristic on real data sets collected in the telecommunications industry. These graphs contain on the order of millions of vertices and edges. 1.

A Foundation for Representing and Querying Moving Objects Spatio-temporal databases deal with geometries changing over time. The goal of our work is to provide a DBMS data model and query language capable of handling such time-dependent geometries, including those changing continuously which describe moving objects. Two fundamental abstractions are moving point and moving region, describing objects for which only the time-dependent position, or position and extent, are of interest, respectively. We propose to represent such time-dependent geometries as attribute data types with suitable operations, that is, to provide an abstract data type extension to a DBMS data model and query language. This paper presents a design of such a system of abstract data types. It turns out that besides the main types of interest, moving point and moving region, a relatively large number of auxiliary data types is needed. For example, one needs a line type to represent the projection of a moving point into the plane, or a ‚Äúmoving real ‚Äù to represent the time-dependent distance of two moving points. It then becomes crucial to achieve (i) orthogonality in the design of the type system, i.e., type constructors can be applied uniformly, (ii) genericity

Constraint Diagram Reasoning Diagrammatic human-computer interfaces are now becoming standard. In the near future, diagrammatic front-ends, such as those of UML-based CASE tools, will be required to offer a much more intelligent behavior than just editing. Yet there is very little formal support and there are almost no tools available for the construction of such environments. The present paper introduces a constraint-based formalism for the specification and implementation of complex diagrammatic environments. We start from grammar-based definitions of diagrammatic languages and show how a constraint solver for diagram recognition and interpretation can automatically be constructed from such grammars. In a second step, the capabilities of these solvers are extended by allowing to axiomatise formal diagrammatic systems, such as Venn Diagrams, so that they can be regarded as a new constraint domain. The ultimate aim of this schema is to establish a language of type CLP(Diagram) for diagrammatic reasoni...

The RETSINA MAS Infrastructure RETSINA is an implemented Multi-Agent System infrastructure that has been developed for several years and applied in many domains ranging from financial portfolio management to logistic planning. In this paper, we distill from our experience in developing MASs to clearly define a generic MAS infrastructure as the domain independent and reusable substratum that supports the agents' social interactions. In addition, we show that the MAS infrastructure imposes requirements on an individual agent if the agent is to be a member of a MAS and take advantage of various components of the MAS infrastructure. Although agents are expected to enter a MAS and seamlessly and e ortlessly interact with the agents in the MAS infrastructure, the current state of the art demands agents to be programmed with the knowledge of what infrastructure they will utilize, and what are various fallback and recovery mechanisms that the infrastructure provides. By providing an abstract MAS infrastructure model and a concrete implemented instance of the model, RETSINA, we contribute towards the development of principles and practice to make the MAS infrastructure "invisible" and ubiquitous to the interacting agents.

A Knowledge-based Approach for Lifelike Gesture Animation . The inclusion of additional modalities into the communicative behavior of virtual agents besides speech has moved into focus of human-computer interface researchers, as humans are more likely to consider computer-generated figures lifelike when appropriate nonverbal behaviors are displayed in addition to speech. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based approach for the automatic generation of gesture animations for an articulated figure. It combines a formalism for the representation of spatiotemporal gesture features, methods for planning individual gestural animations w.r.t. to form and timing, and formation of arm trajectories. Finally, enhanced methods for rendering animations from motor programs are incorporated in the execution of planned gestures. The approach is targetted to achieve a great variety of gestures as well as a higher degree of lifelikeness in synthetic agents.  1 Introduction  The communicative behaviors of virtual anthropomorphic agents, widely used in human-...

Model Generation without Normal Forms and Applications in Natural-Language Semantics . I present a new tableaux-based model generation method for first-order formulas without function symbols. Unlike comparable approaches, the Relational Models (RM) tableaux calculus does not require clausal input theories. I propose some applications of the RM calculus in natural-language semantics and discuss its usefulness as an inference procedure in natural-language processing. 1 Introduction  Refutational methods in automated deduction prove the unsatisfiability of logical theories. For many applications, the interpretations of a theory that show its satisfiability are at least as interesting as proofs. Model generation refers to the automatic construction of such interpretations from first-order theories. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in the automated deduction community in developing model generation methods for various application areas such as finite mathematics [25, 22], deductive databases [7], diagnosis [13, 1], and planning [19].

Probabilistic Self-Localization for Mobile Robots Localization is a critical issue in mobile robotics. If the robot does not know where it is, it, cannot effectively plan movements, locate objects, or reach goals. In this paper, we describe probabilistic self-localization techniques for mobile robots that are based on the principal of maximum-likelihood estimation. The basic method is to compare a map generated at the current robot position to a previously generated map of the environment to prohabilistically maximize the agreement between the maps. This method is able to operate in both indoor and outdoor environments using either discrete features or an occupancy grid to represent the world map. The map may be generated using any method to detect features in the robot's surroundings, including vision, sonar, a d laser range-finder. A global search of the pose space is performed that guarantees that the best position in a discretized pose space is found according to the probabilistic: map agreement measure. In addition, fitting the likelihood function with a parameterized smface allows both subpixel localization and uncertainty estimation to be performed. The application of these techniques in several experiments is described, including experimental localization results for the Sojourner Mars rover. 1

Information Triage using Prospective Criteria : In many applications, large volumes of time-sensitive textual information require triage: rapid, approximate prioritization for subsequent action. In this paper, we explore the use of prospective   indications of the importance of a time-sensitive document, for the purpose of producing better document filtering or ranking. By prospective, we mean importance that could be assessed by actions that occur in the future. For example, a news story may be assessed (retrospectively) as being important, based on events that occurred after the story appeared, such as a stock-price plummeting or the issuance of many follow-up stories. If a system could anticipate (prospectively) such occurrences, it could provide a timely indication of importance. Clearly, perfect prescience is impossible. However, sometimes there is sufficient correlation between the content of an information item and the events that occur subsequently. We describe a process for creating and evaluating approximate information-triage procedures that are based on prospective indications. Unlike many information-retrieval applications for which document labeling is a laborious, manual process, for many prospective criteria it is possible to build very large, labeled, training corpora automatically. Such corpora can be used to train text classification procedures that will predict the (prospective) importance of each document. This paper illustrates the process with two case studies, demonstrating the ability to predict whether the stock price of one or more companies mentioned in a news story will move significantly following the appearance of that story. We conclude by discussing that the comprehensibility of the learned classifiers can be critical to success.  1

Using Guidelines to Constrain Interactive Case-Based HTN Planning This paper describes HICAP, a general purpose and interactive case-based planning architecture. HICAP is a decision support tool for planning a hierarchical course of action. It integrates a hierarchical task editor, HTE, with a conversational case-based planner, NaCoDAE/HTN. HTE maintains a task hierarchy representing guidelines that constrain the final plan. HTE also encodes the hierarchical organization responsible for these tasks. This supports bookkeeping, which is crucial for real-world large-scale planning tasks. HTE can be used to activate NaCoDAE/HTN to interactively refine user-selected guideline tasks into a concrete plan. Our application of HICAP to the task of noncombatant evacuation operations inspired its architecture. In this application, our empirical evaluation with ModSAF simulations confirms that the plans output by HICAP outperform those generated using alternative approaches on three dimensions.

Using Error-Correcting Codes for Efficient Text Classification with a Large Number of Categories We investigate the use of Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) for efficient text classification with a large number of categories and propose several extensions which improve the performance of ECOC. ECOC has been shown to perform well for classification tasks, including text classification, but it still remains an under-explored area in ensemble learning algorithms. We explore the use of error-correcting codes that are short (minimizing computational cost) but result in highly accurate classifiers for several real-world text classification problems. Our results also show that ECOC is particularly effective for highprecision classification. In addition, we develop modifications and improvements to make ECOC more accurate, such as intelligently assigning codewords to categories according to their confusability, and learning the decoding (combining the decisions of the individual classifiers) in order to adapt to different datasets. To reduce the need for labeled training data, we develop a framework for ECOC where unlabeled data can be used to improve classification accuracy. This research will impact any area where efficient classification of documents is useful such as web portals, information filtering and routing, especially in open-domain applications where the number of categories is usually very large, and new documents and categories are being constantly added, and the system needs to be very efficient.

Cryptographic Traces for Mobile Agents . Mobile code systems are technologies that allow applications  to move their code, and possibly the corresponding state, among the  nodes of a wide-area network. Code mobility is a flexible and powerful  mechanism that can be exploited to build distributed applications  in an Internet scale. At the same time, the ability to move code to and  from remote hosts introduces serious security issues. These issues include  authentication of the parties involved and protection of the hosts from  malicious code. However, the most difficult task is to protect mobile  code against attacks coming from hosts. This paper presents a mechanism  based on execution tracing and cryptography that allows one to  detect attacks against code, state, and execution flow of mobile software  components.  1 Introduction  Mobile code technologies are languages and systems that exploit some form of code mobility in an Internet-scale setting.

Mixed-Initiative Interaction = Mixed Computation We show that partial evaluation can be usefully viewed as a programming model for realizing mixed-initiative  functionality in interactive applications. Mixed-initiative interaction between two participants is one where the  parties can take turns at any time to change and steer the flow of interaction. We concentrate on the facet of  mixed-initiative referred to as `unsolicited reporting' and demonstrate how out-of-turn interactions by users can  be modeled by `jumping ahead' to nested dialogs (via partial evaluation). Our approach permits the view of  dialog management systems in terms of their native support for staging and simplifying interactions; we characterize  three different voice-based interaction technologies using this viewpoint. In particular, we show that the  built-in form interpretation algorithm (FIA) in the VoiceXML dialog management architecture is actually a (well  disguised) combination of an interpreter and a partial evaluator.

The State of Change: A Survey . Updates are a crucial component of any database programming language. Even the simplest database transactions, such as withdrawal from a bank account, require updates. Unfortunately, updates are not accounted for by the classical Horn semantics of logic programs and deductive databases, which limits their usefulness in real-world applications. As a short-term practical solution, logic programming languages have resorted to handling updates using ad hoc operators without a logical semantics. A great many works have been dedicated to developing logical theories in which the state of the underlying database can evolve with time. Many of these theories were developed with specific applications in mind, such as reasoning about actions, database transactions, program verification, etc. As a result, the different approaches have different strengths and weaknesses. In this survey, we review a number of these works, discuss their application domains, and highlight their strong and weak points...

Therefore, we describe the sources of knowledge inside a CBR system along with the different knowledge containers. Next we present our framework in terms of these knowledge containers. Further, we apply our framework to two very different knowledge light approaches for learning adaptation knowledge.

There are several branches in different sciences, for instance in biology, physics, economics, or in computer science, that focus on distributed systems of locally interacting entities. Their research yields a number of commonly observed characteristics. To supply engineered systems with similar characteristics this thesis proposes a set of principles that should be observed when designing synthetic ecosystems. Each principle is systematically stated and motivated, and its consequences for the manufacturing control domain are discussed. Stigmergy has shown its usefulness in the coordination of large crowds of agents in a synthetic ecosystem...

Intelligent Data Analysis in Medicine Extensive amounts of knowledge and data stored in medical databases require the  development of specialized tools for storing and accessing of data, data analysis, and effective  use of stored knowledge and data. This paper focuses on methods and tools for  intelligent data analysis, aimed at narrowing the increasing gap between data gathering  and data comprehension. The paper sketches the history of research that led to the  development of current intelligent data analysis techniques, discusses the need for intelligent  data analysis in medicine, and proposes a classification of intelligent data analysis  methods. The scope of the paper covers temporal data abstraction methods and data  mining methods. A selection of methods is presented and illustrated in medical problem  domains. Presently data abstraction and data mining are attracting considerable research  interest. However the two technologies, in spite of the fact that they share their central  objective, namely the intelligen...

Amdb: A Visual Access Method Development Tool The development process for access methods (AMs) in database systems is complex and tedious. Amdb is a graphical tool that facilitates the design and tuning process for height-balanced tree-structured AMs. Central to amdb's  user interface is a suite of graphical views that visualize the entire search tree, paths and subtrees within the tree, and data contained in the tree. These views animate search tree operations in order to visualize the behavior of an access method. Amdb provides metrics that characterize the performance of queries, the tree structure, and the structureshaping aspects of an AM implementation. The visualizations can be used to browse the performance metrics in the context of the tree structure. The combination of these features allows a designer to locate the sources of performance loss reported by the metrics and investigate causes for those deficiencies. 1.

Evaluation challenges for a federation of heterogeneous information providers: The case of NASA's Earth Science Information Partnerships NASA's Earth Science Information Partnership Federation is an experiment funded to assess the ability of a group of widely heterogeneous earth science data or service providers to self organize and provide improved and cheaper access to an expanding earth science user community. As it is organizing itself, the federation is mandated to set in place an evaluation methodology and collect metrics reflecting the health and benefits of the Federation. This paper describes the challenges of organizing such a federated partnership self-evaluation and discusses the issues encountered during the metrics definition phase of the early data collection.

Face Recognition Identifying a human individual from his or her face is one of the most nonintrusive modalities in biometrics. However, it is also one of the most challenging ones. This chapter discusses why it is challenging and the factors that a practitioner can take advantage of in developing a practical face recognition system. Some major existing approaches are discussed along with some algorithmic considerations. A face recognition algorithm is presented as an example along with some experimental data. Some possible future research directions are outlined at the end of the chapter.  1.1 INTRODUCTION  Face recognition from images is a sub-area of the general object recognition problem.

Bimodal System for Interactive Indexing and Retrieval of Pathology Images The prototype of a system to assist the physicians in differential diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorders of blood cells from digitized specimens is presented. The user selects the region of interest (ROI) in the image which is then analyzed with a fast, robust color segmenter. Queries in a database of validated cases can be formulated in terms of shape (similarity invariant Fourier descriptors), texture (multiresolution simultaneous autoregressive model), color (L    u    v    space), and area, derived from the delineated ROI. The uncertainty of the segmentation process (obtained through a numerical method) determines the accuracy of shape description (number of Fourier harmonics). Tenfold cross-validated classification over a database of 261 color 640\Theta480 images was implemented to assess the system performance. The ground truth was obtained through immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. To provide a natural man-machine interface, most input commands are bimodal: either using t...

Animating Spatiotemporal Constraint Databases . Constraint databases provide a very expressive framework  for spatiotemporal database applications. However, animating such databases  is difficult because of the cost of constructing a graphical representation  of a single snapshot of a constraint database. We present a novel approach  that makes the efficient animation of constraint databases possible. The  approach is based on a new construct: parametric polygon. We present  an algorithm to construct the set of parametric polygons that represent  a given linear constraint database. We also show how to animate objects  defined by parametric polygons, analyze the computational complexity  of animation, and present empirical data to demonstrate the efficiency  of our approach.  1 Introduction  Spatiotemporal databases have recently begun to attract broader interest [10, 12, 27]. While the temporal [4, 23, 24] and spatial [14, 28] database technologies are relatively mature, their combination is far from straightforward. In this conte...

A Case for Dynamic View Management this paper, we present DynaMat, a system that manages dynamic collections of materialized aggregate views in a data warehouse. At query time DynaMat utilizes a dedicated disk space for storing computed aggregates that are further engaged for answering new queries. Queries are executed independently, or can be bundled within a multi query expression. In the latter case we present an execution mechanism that exploits dependencies among the queries and the materialized set to further optimize their execution. During updates, DynaMat reconciles the current materialized view selection and refreshes the most beneficial subset of it within a given maintenance window. We show how to derive an efficient update plan with respect to the available maintenance window, the different update policies for the views and the dependencies that exist among them.

An Approach to Classify Semi-Structured Objects . Several advanced applications, such as those dealing with the Web, need to handle data whose structure is not known a-priori. Such requirement severely limits the applicability of traditional database techniques, that are based on the fact that the structure of data (e.g. the database schema) is known before data are entered into the database. Moreover, in traditional database systems, whenever a data item (e.g. a tuple, an object, and so on) is entered, the application species the collection (e.g. relation, class, and so on) the data item belongs to. Collections are the basis for handling queries and indexing and therefore a proper classication of data items in collections is crucial. In this paper, we address this issue in the context of an extended object-oriented data model. We propose an approach to classify objects, created without specifying the class they belong to, in the most appropriate class of the schema, that is, the class closest to the object state. In particular, w...

Experiences with Selecting Search Engines Using Metasearch Search engines are among the most useful and high profile resources on the Internet. The problem of finding information on the Internet has been replaced with the problem of knowing where search engines are, what they are designed to retrieve and how to use them. This paper describes and evaluates SavvySearch, a meta-search engine designed to intelligently select and interface with multiple remote search engines. The primary meta-search issue examined is the importance of carefully selecting and ranking remote search engines for user queries. We studied the efficacy of SavvySearch's incrementally acquired meta-index approach to selecting search engines by analyzing the effect of time and experience on performance. We also compared the meta-index approach to the simpler categorical approach and showed how much experience is required to surpass the simple scheme.  1 Introduction  Search engines are powerful tools for assisting the otherwise unmanageable task of navigating the rapidly ex...

A Rule-based Query Language for HTML With the recent popularity of the web, enormous amount of information is now available on line. Most web documents available over the web are in HTML format and are hierarchically structured in nature. How to query such web documents based on their internal hierarchical structure becomes more and more important. In this paper, we present a rule-based language called WebQL to support effective and flexible web queries. Unlike other web query languages, WebQL is a high level declarative query language with a logical semantics. It allows us to query web documents based on their internal hierarchical structures. It supports not only negation and recursion, but also query result restructuring in a natural way. We also describe the implementation of the system that supports the WebQL query language.

Enlightened Agents in TuCSoN In the network-centric computing era, applications often involve sets of autonomous, unpredictable, and possibly mobile entities interacting within open, dynamic, and possibly unreliable environments: Intelligent Environments are a typical case. The complexity of such scenarios requires novel engineering tools, providing effective support from the analysis to the deployment stage. In this paper we illustrate the impact of a general-purpose coordination infrastructure for multiagent systems -- providing a model, a run-time, and suitable deployment tools -- on the engineering of such applications. As a case study, we consider the intelligent management of lights inside a building: despite its simplicity, this problem endorses the typical challenges of this class of applications. The case study is built upon the TuCSoN coordination infrastructure, which provides engineers  with both the abstractions and the run-time support for effectively managing the application complexity.

Implementing Clinical Practice Guidelines While Taking Account of Changing Evidence: ATHENA DSS, an Easily Modifiable Decision-Support System for Managing Hypertension in Primary Care This paper describes the ATHENA Decision Support System (DSS), which operationalizes guidelines for hypertension using the EON architecture. ATHENA DSS encourages blood pressure control and recommends guideline-concordant choice of drug therapy in relation to comorbid diseases. ATHENA DSS has an easily modifiable knowledge base that specifies eligibility criteria, risk stratification, blood pressure targets, relevant comorbid diseases, guideline-recommended drug classes for patients with comorbid disease, preferred drugs within each drug class, and clinical messages. Because evidence for best management of hypertension evolves continually, ATHENA DSS is designed to allow clinical experts to customize the knowledge base to incorporate new evidence or to reflect local interpretations of guideline ambiguities. Together with its database mediator Athenaeum, ATHENA DSS has physical and logical data independence from the legacy Computerized Patient Record System(CPRS) supplying the patient data, so it can be integrated into a variety of electronic medical record systems.

Inductive Bias in Case-Based Reasoning Systems In order to learn more about the behaviour of case-based reasoners as learning systems, we formalise a simple case-based learner as a PAC learning algorithm, using the case-based representation  hCB; oei. We first consider a `naive' case-based learning algorithm CB1(oeH ) which learns by collecting all available cases into the case-base and which calculates similarity by counting the number of features on which two problem descriptions agree. We present results concerning the consistency of this learning algorithm and give some partial results regarding its sample complexity. We are able to characterise CB1(oeH ) as a `weak but general' learning algorithm. We then consider how the sample complexity of case-based learning can be reduced for specific classes of target concept by the application of inductive bias, or prior knowledge of the class of target concepts. Following recent work demonstrating how case-based learning can be improved by choosing a similarity measure appropriate to t...

Embedding Knowledge in Web Documents The paper argues for the use of general and intuitive knowledge representation languages (and simpler notational variants, e.g. subsets of natural languages) for indexing the content of Web documents and representing knowledge within them. We believe that these languages have advantages over metadata languages based on the Extensible Mark-up Language (XML). Indeed, the retrieval of precise information is better supported by languages designed to represent semantic content and support logical inference, and the readability of such a language eases its exploitation, presentation and direct insertion within a document (thus also avoiding information duplication). We advocate the use of Conceptual Graphs and simpler notational variants that enhance knowledge readability. To further ease the representation process, we propose techniques allowing users to leave some knowledge terms undeclared. We also show how lexical, structural and knowledge-based techniques may be combined to retrieve or ...

Solving Stabilization Problems in Case-Based Knowledge Acquisition Case-based reasoning is widely deemed an important methodology towards alleviating the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition. The key idea is to collect cases representing a human's or a system's experience directly rather than trying to construct generalizations. Episodic knowledge accumulated this way may be used flexibly for different purposes by determining similarities between formerly solved problems and current situations under investigation. But the flexibility of case-based reasoning brings with it a number of disadvantages. One crucial difficulty is that every new experience might seem worth to be memorized. As a result, a case-based reasoning system may substantially suffer from collecting a huge amount of garbage without being able to separate the chaff from the wheat. This paper presents a case study in case-based learning. Some target concept has to be learned by collecting cases and tuning similarity concepts. It is extremely difficult to avoid collecting a huge amount of ...

Affectively tunable environments for the virtual stage (Abstract) Affective computing [8, 9] is an emerging area of human-computer interaction which studies the ways in which computer systems can recognize and work with human emotions. The word affective is an adjective used in psychology to mean "relating to emotions". Examples of affective computing are the creation of systems which respond in different ways according to the system's perception of the user's emotional state [1, 2, 3], and systems which facilitate the communication of emotion through a virtual environment [7].  One aspect of aective computing which is particularly apposite to the theatre is the ability to create environments in which the capacity for communication of emotion (what we might call the affective bandwidth) of the environment is variable [6].

Optimizing the parSOM Neural Network Implementation for Data Mining with Distributed Memory Systems and Cluster Computing The self-organizing map is a prominent unsupervised neural network model which lends itself to the analysis of high-dimensional input data and data mining applications. However, the high execution times required to train the map put a limit to its application in many high-performance data analysis application domains.  In this paper we discuss the parSOM implementation, a software-based parallel implementation of the selforganizing map, and its optimization for the analysis of high-dimensional input data using distributed memory systems and clusters. The original parSOM algorithm scales very well in a parallel execution environment with low communication latencies and exploits parallelism to cope with memory latencies. However it suffers from poor scalability on distributed memory computers. We present optimizations to further decouple the subprocesses, simplify the communication model and improve the portability of the system.  1 Introduction  The self-organizing map (SOM) [5] is a pr...

Modeling Score Distributions for Combining the Outputs of Search Engines In this paper the score distributions of a number of text search engines are modeled. It is shown empirically that the score distributions on a per query basis may be fitted using an exponential distribution for the set of non-relevant documents and a normal distribution for the set of relevant documents. Experiments show that this model fits TREC-3 and TREC-4 data for not only probabilistic search engines like INQUERY but also vector space search engines like SMART for English. We have also used this model to fit the output of other search engines like LSI search engines and search engines indexing other languages like Chinese. It is then shown that given a query for which relevance information is not available, a mixture model consisting of an exponential and a normal distribution can be fitted to the score distribution. These distributions can be used to map the scores of a search engine to probabilities. We also discuss how the shape of the score distributions arise given certain assumptions about word distributions in documents. We hypothesize that all 'good' text search engines operating on any language have similar characteristics. This model has many possible applications. For example, the outputs of different search engines can be combined by averaging the probabilities (optimal if the search engines are independent) or by using the probabilities to select the best engine for each query. Results show that the technique performs as well as the best current combination techniques. This material is based on work supported in part by the National Science Foundation, Library of Congress and Department of Commerce under cooperative agreement number EEC-9209623, in part by the National Science Foundation under grant numbers IRI-9619117 and IIS-9909073, in part by N...

Designing Graspable Groupware for Co-Located Planning and Configuration Tasks This paper shows some of the vital steps in the design process of a graspable groupware system. Activity theory is the theoretical foundation for our research. Our design philosophy is based on the tradition of Augmented Reality (AR), which enriches natural communication with virtual features. Another important part of our design philosophy is the use of coinciding action and perception spaces. We developed groupware for layout planning and configuration tasks called the BUILD-IT system. This system enables users, grouped around a table, to cooperate in the design manipulation of a virtual setting, thus supporting colocated, instead of distributed, interaction (Rauterberg et al., 1997a, 1997b, 1998; Fjeld et al., 1998a). The multi-user nature of BUILD-IT overcomes a serious drawback often seen with CSCW tools, namely that they are based on single-user applications (Grudin, 1988). We believe that co-location is an indispensable factor for the early stage of a complex planning process. Input and output, however, can be prepared and further developed off-line (Fjeld et al., 1998b), using any conventional CAD system.

Distributed Query Scheduling Service: An Architecture and Its Implementation We present the systematic design and development of a distributed query scheduling service (DQS) in the context of DIOM, a distributed and interoperable query mediation system [26]. DQS consists of an extensible architecture for distributed query processing, a three-phase optimization algorithm for generating efficient query execution schedules, and a prototype implementation. Functionally, two important execution models of distributed queries, namely moving query to data or moving data to query, are supported and combined into a unified framework, allowing the data sources with limited search and filtering capabilities to be incorporated through wrappers into the distributed query scheduling process. Algorithmically, conventional optimization factors (such as join order) are considered separately from and refined by distributed system factors (such as data distribution, execution location, heterogeneous host capabilities), allowing for stepwise refinement through three optimization phases: compilation, parallelization, site selection and execution. A subset of DQS algorithms has been implemented in Java to demonstrate the practicality of the architecture and the usefulness of the distributed query scheduling algorithm in optimizing execution schedules for inter-site queries.

Following the paths of XML Data: An algebraic framework for XML query evaluation This paper introduces an algebraic framework for expressing and evaluating queries over XML data.  It presents the underlying assumptions of the framework, describes the input and output of the algebraic  operators, and defines these operators and their semantics. It evaluates the framework with regard to  other proposed XML query algebras. Examples show that this framework is flexible enough to capture  queries expressed in Quilt, one of the dominant XML query languages. We have used this algebra in the  context of an Internet query engine, in which it is used to formulate logical plans for XML-QL queries.  We define equivalence rules that provide opportunities for optimization, and give example cases that  point out the usefulness of these rules.  1

Essential Principles for Workflow Modelling Effectiveness While the specification languages of workflow management systems focus on process execution  semantics, the successful development of workflows relies on a fuller conceptualisation of  business processing, including process semantics. Traditionally, the success of conceptual modelling   techniques has depended largely on the adequacy of certain requirements: conceptualisation  (following the Conceptualisation Principle), expressive power (following the One Hundred Principle)  , comprehensibility and formal foundation. An equally important requirement, particularly  with the increased conceptualisation of business aspects, is business suitability. In this paper, the  focus is on the suitability of workflow modelling for a commonly encountered class of (operational)  business processing, e.g. those of insurance claims, bank loans and land conveyancing.

We define a query language (where queries are non-recursive  Datalog programs and atoms are complex DLRUS expressions) and investigate the problem of  checking query containment under the constraints defined by DLRUS conceptual schemas---i.e.,  DLRUS knowledge bases---as well as the problems of schema satisfiability and logical implication.

Learning in Case-Based Classification Algorithms While symbolic learning approaches encode the knowledge provided by the presentation of the cases explicitly into a symbolic representation of the concept , e.g. formulas, rules, or decision trees, case-based approaches describe learned concepts implicitly by a pair (CB;d), i.e. by a set CB  of cases and a distance measure d. Given the same information, symbolic as well as the case-based approach compute a classification when a new case is presented. This poses the question if there are any differences concerning the learning power of the two approaches. In this work we will study the relationship between the case base, the measure of distance, and the target concept of the learning process. To do so, we transform a simple symbolic learning algorithm (the version space algorithm) into an equivalent case-based variant. The achieved results strengthen the conjecture of the equivalence of the learning power of symbolic and casebased methods and show the interdependency between the measure...

Erratic Fudgets: A Semantic Theory for an Embedded Coordination Language The powerful abstraction mechanisms of functional programming languages provide the means to develop domain-specific programming languages within the language itself. Typically, this is realised by designing a set of combinators (higher-order reusable programs) for an application area, and by constructing individual applications by combining and coordinating individual combinators. This paper is concerned with a successful example of such an embedded programming language, namely Fudgets, a library of combinators for building graphical user interfaces in the lazy functional language Haskell. The Fudget library has been used to build a number of substantial applications, including a web browser and a proof editor interface to a proof checker for constructive type theory. This paper develops a semantic theory for the non-deterministic stream processors that are at the heart of the Fudget concept. The interaction of two features of stream processors makes the development of such a semantic theory problematic:  the sharing of computation provided by the lazy evaluation mechanism of the underlying host language, and  the addition of non-deterministic choice needed to handle the natural concurrency that reactive applications entail.  We demonstrate that this combination of features in a higher-order functional language can be tamed to provide a tractable semantic theory and induction principles suitable for reasoning about contextual equivalence of Fudgets.

Visualisation Effectiveness Providing evaluations of visualisations is one way to demonstrate that they support a purpose and are adequate for the role claimed for them. The problem in doing so is that there is no central source of evaluation issues that one can use a subset of for this purpose. There is also very little in the way of agreement over what constitutes a good visualisation hence the evaluation criteria differ. There are the human-computer interaction ideals, the slightly differing ones from usability engineering, those from the visualisation community, and also the need to be able to support the variable abilities of the users. Graphics, as the medium behind visualisation, may support greater bandwidth, but is also prone to more likes and dislikes than other forms of interface. The concept of visualisation effectiveness and therefore ways of evaluating visualisations provide the focus for this paper.  Keywords: Visualisation, Evaluation, Usability,  Understanding  1

Discovering Internet Resources to Enrich a Structured Personal Information Space The Internet is a tremendous resource where one can find documents to enrich a personal information space. The question is: how can one find relevant documents and how can these be organized into an information space?

BBQ: A Visual Interface for Integrated Browsing and Querying of XML In this paper we present BBQ (Blended Browsing and Querying), a graphic user interface for seamlessly browsing and querying XML data sources. BBQ displays the structure of multiple data sources using a paradigm that resembles drilling-down in Windows' directory structures. BBQ allows queries incorporating one or more of the sources. Queries are constructed in a query-by-example (QBE) manner, where DTDs play the role of schema. The queries are arbitrary conjunctive queries with GROUPBY, and their results can be subsequently used and refined. To support query refinement, BBQ introduces virtual result views: standalone virtual data sources that (i) are constructed by user queries, from elements in other data sources, and (ii) can be used in subsequent queries as first-class data sources themselves. Furthermore, BBQ allows users to query data sources with loose or incomplete schema, and can augment such schema with a DTD inference mechanism.

Computational Logic and Machine Learning: A roadmap for Inductive Logic Programming Computational logic has already significantly influenced (symbolic) machine learning through the field of inductive logic programming (ILP) which is concerned with the induction of logic programs from examples and background knowledge. In ILP, the shift of attention from program synthesis to knowledge discovery resulted in advanced techniques that are practically applicable for discovering knowledge in relational databases. Machine learning, and ILP in particular, has the potential to influence computational logic by providing an application area full of industrially significant problems, thus providing a challenge for other techniques in computational logic. This paper gives a brief introduction to ILP, presents state-of-the-art ILP techniques for relational knowledge discovery as well as some research and organizational directions for further developments in this area. 1 Introduction  Inductive logic programming (ILP) [35, 39, 29] is a research area that has its backgrounds in induct...

A systematic classification of replicated database protocols based on atomic broadcast Database replication protocols based on group communication primitives have recently emerged as a promising technology to improve database faulttolerance and performance. Roughly speaking, this approach consists in exploiting the order and atomicity properties provided by group communication primitives or, more specifically Atomic Broadcast, to guarantee transaction properties.

A Methodology for Agent-Oriented Analysis and Design . This article presents Gaia: a methodology for agent-oriented analysis and design. The Gaia methodology is both general, in that it is applicable to a wide range of multi-agent systems, and comprehensive, in that it deals with both the macro-level (societal) and the micro-level (agent) aspects of systems. Gaia is founded on the view of a multi-agent system as a computational organisation consisting of various interacting roles. We illustrate Gaia through a case study (an agent-based business process management system).  1. Introduction  Progress in software engineering over the past two decades has been made through the development of increasingly powerful and natural high-level abstractions with which to model and develop complex systems. Procedural abstraction, abstract data types, and, most recently, objects and components are all examples of such abstractions. It is our belief that agents represent a similar advance in abstraction: they may be used by software developers to more n...

The Abels Framework For Linking Distributed Simulations Using Software Agents Many simulations need access to dynamicallychanging data from other sources such as sensors or even other simulations. For example, a forest fire simulation may need data from sensors in the forest and a weather simulation at a remote site. We have developed an agentbased software framework to facilitate the dynamic exchange of data between distributed simulations and other remote data resources. The framework, called ABELS (Agent-Based Environment for Linking Simulations), allows independently designed simulations to communicate seamlessly with no a priori knowledge of the details of other simulations and data resources. This paper discusses our architecture and current implementation using Sun Microsystems' Jini technology and the D'Agents mobile agent system. This paper extends earlier work by describing the implementation of the brokering system for matching data producers and consumers and providing additional details of other components.

Development and Characterization of an Acoustic Rangefinder Localization is important to wearable and embedded applications at many levels. For example, it might be used to implement \physical" user interfaces which detect body language or the user's positioning of objects in the environment. This paper presents the initial results of a prototype implementation of an acoustic rangender. Unlike other published work in this area, this design uses a sliding correlator to detect the acoustic signal. This technique signicantly improves performance in obstructed and noisy environments. Ongoing work towards a more compact implementation and towards new protocols for establishing coordinate systems is also described.  1 Introduction  When the members of our research group are brainstorming applications for our soon-to-be-indispensible ad-hoc networked sensor technology, we often run into the same brick wall: how do we do anything that is physically motivated and context aware without localization ?

Totally Ordered Broadcast and Multicast Algorithms: A Comprehensive Survey Total order multicast algorithms constitute an important class of problems in distributed systems, especially  in the context of fault-tolerance. In short, the problem of total order multicast consists in sending  messages to a set of processes, in such a way that all messages are delivered by all correct destinations in the  same order. However, the huge amount of literature on the subject and the plethora of solutions proposed so  far make it difficult for practitioners to select a solution adapted to their specific problem. As a result, naive  solutions are often used while better solutions are ignored.  This paper proposes a classification of total order multicast algorithms based on the ordering mechanism  of the algorithms, and describes a set of common characteristics (e.g., assumptions, properties) with which  to evaluate them. In this classification, more than fifty total order broadcast and multicast algorithms are surveyed.  The presentation includes asynchronous algorithms ...

Supporting Internet-Scale Multi-Agent Systems ts a model of AgentScape from the agent perspective, that is, the location comprising the middleware and the resources are represented by a location manager agent and resource objects. Calls from an agent to the middleware are modeled by requests to the location manager agent to, for example, create an agent or move an agent. Information about resources residing at the location can be retrieved by binding to the resource objects, which are local distributed objects. These objects can be accessed only within the location they reside, not from outside the location.  For development of agent applications, an application programming interface (API) and a runtime system (RTS) are provided, see Fig. 1. The default API and RTS can be extended to provide a higher-level application programming interface with, for example, a model that offers more structure and semantics to the agent application developer.

Exception Handling in Agent Systems A critical challenge to creating effective agent-based systems is allowing them to operate effectively when the operating environment is complex, dynamic, and error-prone. In this paper we will review the limitations of current "agent-local" approaches to exception handling in agent systems, and propose an alternative approach based on a shared exception handling service that is "plugged", with little or no customization, into existing agent systems. This service can be viewed as a kind of "coordination doctor"; it knows about the different ways multi-agent systems can get "sick", actively looks system-wide for symptoms of such "illnesses", and prescribes specific interventions instantiated for this particular context from a body of general treatment procedures. Agents need only implement their normative behavior plus a minimal set of interfaces. We claim that this approach offers simplified agent development as well as more effective and easier to modify exception handling behavior. T...

This paper presents a system which combines spoken query in addition to automatic title summarization to ease searching for information on a mobile device. Preliminary usability study with 10 subjects indicates that spoken queries is preferred over other input methods.

Face Image Retrieval Using HMMs This paper introduces a new face recognition system that can be used to index (and thus retrieve) images and videos of a database of faces. New face recognition approaches are needed because, although much progress has been made to identify face taken from different viewpoints, we still cannot robustly identify faces under different illumination conditions, or when the facial expression changes, or when a part of the face is occluded on account of glasses or parts of clothing. When face recognition methods have worked in the past, it was only when all possible "image variations" were learned. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) are well-known cases of such methods. In this paper we present a different approach to the indexing of face images. Our approach is based on identifying frontal faces and it allows reasonable variability in facial expressions, illumination conditions, and occlusions caused by eye-wear or items of clothing such as scarves.

Classification With Sparse Grids Using Simplicial Basis Functions Recently we presented a new approach [20] to the classification problem arising in data mining. It is based on the regularization network approach but in contrast to other methods, which employ ansatz functions associated to data points, we use a grid in the usually high-dimensional feature space for the minimization process. To cope with the curse of dimensionality, we employ sparse grids [52]. Thus, only O(h ‚àí1 n n d‚àí1) instead of O(h ‚àíd n) grid points and unknowns are involved. Here d denotes the dimension of the feature space and hn = 2 ‚àín gives the mesh size. We use the sparse grid combination technique [30] where the classification problem is discretized and solved on a sequence of conventional grids with uniform mesh sizes in each dimension. The sparse grid solution is then obtained by linear combination. The method computes a nonlinear classifier but scales only linearly with the number of data points and is well suited for data mining applications where the amount of data is very large, but where the dimension of the feature space is moderately high. In contrast to our former work, where d-linear functions were used, we now apply linear basis functions based on a simplicial discretization. This allows to handle more dimensions and the algorithm needs less operations per data point. We further extend the method to so-called anisotropic sparse grids, where now different a-priori chosen mesh sizes can be used for the discretization of each attribute. This can improve the run time of the method and the approximation results in the case of data sets with different importance of the attributes. We describe the sparse grid combination technique for the classification problem, give implementational details and discuss the complexity of the algorithm. It turns out that the method scales linearly with the number of given data points. Finally we report on the quality of the classifier built by our new method on data sets with up to 14 dimensions. We show that our new method achieves correctness rates which are competitive to those of the best existing methods.

Real-world Data is Dirty: Data Cleansing and The Merge/Purge Problem The problem of merging multiple databases of information about common entities is frequently encountered in KDD and decision support applications in large commercial and government organizations. The problem we study is often called the Merge/Purge problem and is difficult to solve both in scale and accuracy. Large repositories of data typically have numerous duplicate information entries about the same entities that are difficult to cull together without an intelligent "equational theory" that identifies equivalent items by a complex, domain-dependent matching process. We have developed a system for accomplishing this Data Cleansing task and demonstrate its use for cleansing lists of names of potential customers in a direct marketing-type application. Our results for statistically generated data are shown to be accurate and effective when processing the data multiple times using different keys for sorting on each successive pass.

Diagnosis as an Integral Part of Multi-Agent Adaptability Agents working under real world conditions may face an environment capable of changing rapidly from one moment to the next, either through perceived faults, unexpected interactions or adversarial intrusions. To gracefully and efficiently handle such situations, the members of a multi-agent system must be able to adapt, either by evolving internal structures and behavior or repairing or isolating those external influenced believed to be malfunctioning. The first step in achieving adaptability is diagnosis - being able to accurately detect and determine the cause of a fault based on its symptoms. In this paper we examine how domain independent diagnosis plays a role in multi-agent systems, including the information required to support and produce diagnoses. Particular attention is paid to coordination based diagnosis directed by a causal model. Several examples are described in the context of an Intelligent Home environment, and the issue of diagnostic sensitivity versus efficiency is ad...

Concept Decompositions for Large Sparse Text Data using Clustering Abstract. Unlabeled document collections are becoming increasingly common and available; mining such data sets represents a major contemporary challenge. Using words as features, text documents are often represented as high-dimensional and sparse vectors‚Äìa few thousand dimensions and a sparsity of 95 to 99 % is typical. In this paper, we study a certain spherical k-means algorithm for clustering such document vectors. The algorithm outputs k disjoint clusters each with a concept vector that is the centroid of the cluster normalized to have unit Euclidean norm. As our first contribution, we empirically demonstrate that, owing to the high-dimensionality and sparsity of the text data, the clusters produced by the algorithm have a certain ‚Äúfractal-like ‚Äù and ‚Äúself-similar ‚Äù behavior. As our second contribution, we introduce concept decompositions to approximate the matrix of document vectors; these decompositions are obtained by taking the least-squares approximation onto the linear subspace spanned by all the concept vectors. We empirically establish that the approximation errors of the concept decompositions are close to the best possible, namely, to truncated singular value decompositions. As our third contribution, we show that the concept vectors are localized in the word space, are sparse, and tend towards orthonormality. In contrast, the singular vectors are global in the word space and are dense. Nonetheless, we observe the surprising fact that the linear subspaces spanned by the concept vectors and the leading singular vectors are quite close in the sense of small principal angles between them. In conclusion, the concept vectors produced by the spherical k-means

Computation of the Semantics of Autoepistemic Belief Theories Recently, one of the authors introduced a simple and yet powerful non-monotonic knowledge representation framework, called the Autoepistemic Logic of Beliefs, AEB. Theories in AEB are called autoepistemic belief theories. Every belief theory  T has been shown to have the least static expansion T which is computed by iterating a natural monotonic belief closure operator \Psi T starting from T . This way, the least static expansion T of any belief theory provides its natural non-monotonic semantics which is called the static semantics.  It is easy to see that if a belief theory T is finite then the construction of its least static expansion T stops after countably many iterations. However, a somewhat surprising result obtained in this paper shows that the least static expansion of any finite belief theory T is in fact obtained by means of a single iteration of the belief closure operator \Psi T (although this requires T to be of a special form, we also show that T can be always put in th...

Belief Reasoning in MLS Deductive Databases It is envisaged that the application of the multilevel security (MLS) scheme will enhance exibility and e ectiveness of authorization policies in shared enterprise databases and will replace cumbersome authorization enforcement practices through complicated view de nitions on a per user basis. However, as advances in this area are being made and ideas crystallized, the concomitantweaknesses of the MLS databases are also surfacing. We insist that the critical problem with the current model is that the belief at a higher security level is cluttered with irrelevant or inconsistent data as no mechanism for attenuation is supported. Critics also argue that it is imperative for MLS database users to theorize about the belief of others, perhaps at di erent security levels, an apparatus that is currently missing and the absence of which is seriously felt. The impetus for our current research is this need to provide an adequate framework for belief reasoning in MLS databases. We demonstrate that a prudent application of the concept of inheritance in a deductive database setting will help capture the notion of declarative belief and belief reasoning in MLS databases in an elegantway. To this end, we develop a function to compute belief in multiple modes which can be used to reason about the beliefs of other users. We strive to develop a poised and practical logical characterization of MLS databases for the rst time based on the inherently di cult concept of non-monotonic inheritance. We present an extension of the acclaimed Datalog language, called the MultiLog, and show that Datalog is a special case of our language. We also suggest an implementation scheme for MultiLog as a front-end for CORAL. Key Words: MLS databases, belief assertion, reasoning,

Face Recognition Using Evolutionary Pursuit . This paper describes a novel and adaptive dictionary method for face recognition using genetic algorithms (GAs) in determining the optimal basis for encoding human faces. In analogy to pursuit methods, our novel method is called Evolutionary Pursuit (EP), and it allows for different types of (non-orthogonal) bases. EP processes face images in a lower dimensional whitened PCA subspace. Directed but random rotations of the basis vectors in this subspace are searched by GAs where evolution is driven by a fitness function defined in terms of performance accuracy and class separation (scatter index). Accuracy indicates the extent to which learning has been successful so far, while the scatter index gives an indication of the expected fitness on future trials. As a result, our approach improves the face recognition performance compared to PCA, and shows better generalization abilities than the Fisher Linear Discriminant (FLD) based methods. 1 Introduction  A successful face recognition met...

Coordinating Heterogeneous Work: Information and Representation in Medical Care Introduction  The concept of a common information space, or CIS, has become an influential way to think about the use of shared information in collaboration. Originating in the work of Schmidt and Bannon (1992), and further explored by Bannon and Bdker (1997), it was designed to extend then-current notions about the role of technology and shared information.  At the time this was originally proposed, a great deal of technical attention was being paid to the development of "shared workspace" systems (e.g. Lu and Mantei 1991; Ishii et al. 1992). These systems attempted to extend the workspaces of conventional single-user applications such as word processors and drawing tools, allowing synchronous or asynchronous collaboration across digital networks. Designing effective shared workspace systems presented a range of technical challenges concerning appropriate network protocols, synchronisation, concurrency control mechanisms, and user interface design.

The minimization problems in this class of geometry molecular problems have no  constraints and the objective function is smooth.

Why Autonomy Makes the Agent This paper works on the premise that the position stated by Jennings et al. [17] is correct. Specifically that, amongst other things, the agent metaphor is a useful extension of the object-oriented metaphor. Object-oriented (OO) programming [29] is programming where data-abstraction is achieved by users defining their own data-structures (see figure 1), or "objects". These objects encapsulate data and methods for operating on that data; and the OO framework allows new objects to be created that inherit the properties (both data and methods) of existing objects. This allows archetypeal objects to be defined and then extended by different programmers, who needn't have complete understanding of exactly how the underlying objects are implemented

Formal Models and Decision Procedures for Multi-Agent Systems The study of computational agents capable of rational behaviour has received a great deal of attention in recent years. A number of theoretical formalizations for such multiagent systems have been proposed. However, most of these formalizations do not have a strong semantic basis nor a sound and complete axiomatization. Hence, it has not been clear as to how these formalizations could be used in building agents in practice. This paper explores a particular type of multi-agent system, in which each agent is viewed as having the three mental attitudes of belief (B), desire (D), and intention (I). It provides a family of multi-modal branching-time BDI logics with a semantics that is grounded in traditional decision theory and a possible-worlds framework, categorizes them, provides sound and complete axiomatizations, and gives constructive tableaubased decision procedures for testing the satisfiability and validity of formulas. The computational complexity of these decision procedures is n...

GripSee: A Gesture-controlled Robot for Object Perception and Manipulation We have designed a research platform for a perceptually guided robot, which also serves as a demonstrator for a coming generation of service robots. In order to operate semi-autonomously, these require a capacity for learning about their environment and tasks, and will have to interact directly with their human operators. Thus, they must be supplied with skills in the fields of human-computer interaction, vision, and manipulation. (GripSee is able to autonomously grasp and manipulate objects on a table in front of it. The choice of object, the grip to be used, and the desired final position are indicated by an operator using hand gestures. Grasping is performed similar to human behavior: the object is first fixated, then its form, size, orientation, and position are determined, a grip is planned, and finally the object is grasped, moved to a new position, and released. As a final example for useful autonomous behavior we show how the calibration of the robot's image-to-world coordinate transform can be learned from experience, thus making detailed and unstable calibration of this important subsystem superfluous. The integration concepts developed at our institute have led to a flexible library of robot skills that can be easily recombined for a variety of useful behaviors.

Active Hidden Markov Models for Information Extraction Information extraction from HTML documents requires a classifier capable of assigning semantic labels to the words or word sequences to be extracted. If completely labeled documents are available for training, well-known Markov model techniques can be used to learn such classifiers. In this paper, we consider the more challenging task of learning hidden Markov models (HMMs) when only partially (sparsely) labeled documents are available for training. We first give detailed account of the task and its appropriate loss function, and show how it can be minimized given an HMM. We describe an EM style algorithm for learning HMMs from partially labeled data. We then present an active learning algorithm that selects "difficult" unlabeled tokens and asks the user to label them. We study empirically by how much active learning reduces the required data labeling effort, or increases the quality of the learned model achievable with a given amount of user effort.

Towards A Semantic Framework For Service Description The rapid development of the Internet and of distributed computing has led to a proliferation of online service providers such as digital libraries, web information sources, electronically requestable traditional services, and even software-to-software services such as those provided by persistence and event managers. This has created a need for catalogs of services, based on description languages covering both traditional and electronic services. This paper presents a classification and a domainindependent characterisation of services, which provide a foundation for their description to potential consumers. For each of the service characteristics that we consider, we identify the range of its possible values in di#erent settings, and when applicable, we point to alternative approaches for representing these values. The idea is that by merging # This work was funded by an Australian Research Council SPIRT Grant entitled "Selfdescribing transactions operating in a open, heterogeneous and distributed environment" involving QUT and GBST Holdings Pty Ltd.  1  2  these individual approaches, and by mapping them into a unified notation, it is possible to design service description languages suitable for advertisement and matchmaking within specific application settings.  1.

Mixed Initiative Interfaces for Learning Tasks: SMARTedit Talks Back Applications of machine learning can be viewed as teacherstudent interactions in which the teacher provides training examples and the student learns a generalization of the training examples. One such application of great interest to the IUI community is adaptive user interfaces. In the traditional learning interface, the scope of teacher-student interactions consists solely of the teacher/user providing some number of training examples to the student/learner and testing the learned model on new examples. Active learning approaches go one step beyond the traditional interaction model and allow the student to propose new training examples that are then solved by the teacher. In this paper, we propose that interfaces for machine learning should even more closely resemble human teacher-student relationships. A teacher's time and attention are precious resources. An intelligent student must proactively contribute to the learning process, by reasoning about the quality of its knowledge, collaborating with the teacher, and suggesting new examples for her to solve. The paper describes a variety of rich interaction modes that enhance the learning process and presents a decision-theoretic framework, called DIAManD, for choosing the best interaction. We apply the framework to the SMARTedit programming by demonstration system and describe experimental validation and preliminary user feedback.

Semantics of BDI Agents and their Environment This paper describes an approach for reasoning about the interactions of multiple agents in moderately complex environments. The semantics of Belief Desire Intention (BDI) agents has been investigated by many researchers and the gap between theoretical specification and practical design is starting to be bridged. However, the research has concentrated on single-agent semantics rather than multiagent semantics and has not emphasised the semantics of the environment and its interaction with the agent. This paper describes a class of simple BDI agents and uses a recently introduced logic of actions to provide semantics for these agents independent of the environment in which they may be embedded. The same logic is used to describe the semantics of the environment itself and the interactions between the agent and the environment. As there is no restriction on the number of agents the environment may interact with, the approach can be used to address the semantics of multiple interacting ag...

Estimation of R√©nyi Information Divergence via Pruned Minimal Spanning Trees In this paper we develop robust estimators of the R enyi information divergence (I-divergence) given a reference distribution and a random sample from an unknown distribution. Estimation is performed by constructing a minimal spanning tree (MST) passing through the random sample points and applying a change of measure which flattens the reference distribution. In a mixture model where the reference distribution is contaminated by an unknown noise distribution one can use these results to reject noise samples by implementing a greedy algorithm for pruning the k-  longest branches of the MST, resulting in a tree called the k-MST. We illustrate this procedure in the context of density discrimination and robust clustering for a planar mixture model. 1.

DOGMA: A GA-Based Relational Learner We describe a GA-based concept learning/theory revision system DOGMA and discuss how it can be applied to relational learning. The search for better theories in DOGMA is guided by a novel fitness function that combines the minimal description length and information gain measures. To show the efficacy of the system we compare it to other learners in three relational domains. Keywords: Relational Learning, Genetic Algorithms, Minimal Description Length  1 Introduction  Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are stochastic general purpose search algorithms, that have been applied to a wide range of Machine Learning problems. They work by evolving a population of chromosomes, each of which encodes a potential solution to the problem at hand. The task of a GA is to find a highly fit chromosome through the application of different selection and perturbation operators.

New experimental results are presented, providing evidence that probabilistic retrieval has superior performance. Finally, a unified representation for texture and color is introduced. 1 Introduction  The problem of retrieving images or video from a database is naturally formulated as a problem of pattern recognition. Given a representation (or feature) space F for the entries in the database, the design of a retrieval system consists of finding a map  g : F ! M = f1; : : : ; Kg  x ! y  from F to the set M of classes identified as useful for the retrieval operation. K, the cardinality of M , can be as large as the number of items in the database (in which case each item is a class by itself), or smaller.

An Introduction to Software Agents ion and delegation: Agents can be made extensible and composable in ways that common iconic interface objects cannot. Because we can "communicate" with them, they can share our goals, rather than simply process our commands. They can show us how to do things and tell us what went wrong (Miller and Neches 1987). . Flexibility and opportunism: Because they can be instructed at the level of 16 BRADSHAW goals and strategies, agents can find ways to "work around" unforeseen problems and exploit new opportunities as they help solve problems. . Task orientation: Agents can be designed to take the context of the person's tasks and situation into account as they present information and take action. . Adaptivity: Agents can use learning algorithms to continually improve their behavior by noticing recurrent patterns of actions and events. Toward Agent-Enabled System Architectures In the future, assistant agents at the user interface and resource-managing agents behind the scenes will increas...

Declarative Semantics Of Belief Queries In MLS Deductive Databases A logic based language, called MultiLog, for multi level secure relational databases has recently been proposed. It has been shown that MultiLog is capable of capturing the notion of user belief, of ltering unwanted and \useless" information in its proof theory. Additionally, it can guard against a previously unknown security breach { the so called surprise stories. In this paper, we outline a possible approach to a declarative characterization of belief queries in MultiLog in a very informal manner. We show that for \simple programs" with belief queries, the semantics is rather straight forward. Semantics for the general Horn programs may be developed based on the understanding of the model theoretic characterization of belief queries developed in this paper.  Keywords: Multi level security, belief queries, declarative semantics, completeness.

"Plug And Test" - Software Agents In Virtual Environments James - A Java Based agent modeling environment for simulation has been developed to support the compositional construction of test beds for multi-agent systems and their execution in distributed environments. The modeling formalism of James imposes only few constraints on the modeling of agents and facilitates a \plug and test" with pieces of agent code which has been demonstrated in earlier work. However, even entire agents can be run in James as they are run in their run-time environment. The integration of agents as a whole is based on model templates which serve as the agents' interface and representative during the simulation run. The eort which is put into dening model templates for selected agent systems obviates the need for the single agent programmer to get acquainted with the underlying modeling and simulation formalism. Instead the agent programmer can compose the experimental frame and test the programmed agents as they are. The approach is illustrated with agents of the mobile agent system Mole.  1

Using Self-Diagnosis to Adapt Organizational Structures The specific organization used by a multi-agent system is crucial for its effectiveness and efficiency. In dynamic environments, or when the objectives of the system shift, the organization must therefore be able to change as well. In this abstract we propose using a general diagnosis engine to drive this process of adaptation, using the TMS modeling language as the primary representation of organizational information. A complete version of this paper is at [1].  As the sizes of multi-agent systems grow in the number of their participants, the organization of those agents will be increasingly important. In such an environment, an organization is used to limit the range of control decisions agents must make, which is a necessary component of scalable systems. Are agent agents arranged in clusters, a hierarchy, a graph, or some other type of organization? Are the agents` activities or behaviors driven solely by local concerns, or do external peers or managers have direct influence as wel...

The Adaptive Agent Architecture: Achieving Fault-Tolerance Using Persistent Broker Teams Brokers are used in many multi-agent systems for locating agents, for routing and sharing  information, for managing the system, and for legal purposes, as independent third parties.  However, these multi-agent systems can be incapacitated and rendered non-functional when the  brokers become inaccessible due to failures such as machine crashes, network breakdowns, and  process failures that can occur in any distributed software system.  We propose that the theory of teamwork can be used to create robust brokered architectures that  can recover from broker failures, and we present the Adaptive Agent Architecture (AAA) to show  the feasibility of this approach. The AAA brokers form a team with a joint commitment to serve  any agent that registers with the broker team as long as the agent remains registered with the  team. This commitment enables the brokers to substitute for each other when needed. A multiagent  system based on the AAA can continue to work despite broker failures as long...

Path Constraints on Deterministic Graphs We study path constraints for deterministic graph model [9], a variation of semistructured data model in which data is represented as a rooted edge-labeled directed graph with deterministic edge relations. The path constraint languages considered include the class of word constraints introduced in [4], the language P c investigated in [8], and an extension of P c defined in terms of regular expressions. Complexity results on the implication and finite implication problems for these constraint languages are established. 1 Introduction  Semistructured data is characterized as having no type constraints, irregular structure and rapidly evolving or missing schema [1, 6]. Examples of such data can be found on the WorldWide -Web, in biological databases and after data integration.

Foundations of Spatioterminological Reasoning with Description Logics This paper presents a method for reasoning about spatial objects and their qualitative spatial relationships. In contrast to existing work, which mainly focusses on reasoning about qualitative spatial relations alone, we integrate quantitative and qualitative information with terminological reasoning. For spatioterminological reasoning we present the description logic  ALCRP(D)  and define an appropriate concrete domain  D  for polygons. The theory is motivated as a basis for knowledge representation and query processing in the domain of deductive geographic information systems. 1 Introduction  Qualitative relations play an important role in formal reasoning systems that can be part of, for instance, geographic information systems (GIS). In this context, inferences about spatial relations should not be considered in isolation but should be integrated with formal inferences about structural descriptions of domain objects (e.g. automatic consistency checking and classification) and infer...

Improving the Wang and Mendel's Fuzzy Rule Learning Method by Inducing Cooperation Among Rules Nowadays, Linguistic Modeling (LM) is considered  to be one of the most important areas  of application for Fuzzy Logic. It is accomplished  by descriptive Fuzzy Rule-Based  Systems (FRBSs), whose most interesting  feature is the interpolative reasoning they  develop. This characteristic plays a key role  in the high performance of FRBSs and is a  consequence of the cooperation among the  fuzzy rules involved in the FRBS.  A large quantity of automatic techniques has  been proposed to generate these fuzzy rules  from numerical data. One of the most interesting  families of techniques, due to its  simplicity and quickness, is the ad hoc datadriven  methods. However, its main drawback  is the cooperation among the rules  which is not suitably considered.  With the aim of facing up this drawback,  which makes the obtained models not to  be as accurate as desired, a new approach  to improve the performance obtaining more  cooperative rules is introduced in this paper.

BDI Agents: from Theory to Practice The study of computational agents capable of rational behaviour has received a great deal of attention in recent years. Theoretical formalizations of such agents and their implementations have proceeded in parallel with little or no connection between them. This paper explores a particular type of rational agent, a BeliefDesire -Intention (BDI) agent. The primary aim of this paper is to integrate (a) the theoretical foundations of BDI agents from both a quantitative decision-theoretic perspective and a symbolic reasoning perspective; (b) the implementations of BDI agents from an ideal theoretical perspective and a more practical perspective; and (c) the building of large-scale applications based on BDI agents. In particular, an air-traffic management application will be described from both a theoretical and an implementation perspective.

Bridging Multiple User Interface Dimensions with Augmented Reality Studierstube is an experimental user interface system, which uses collaborative augmented reality to incorporate true 3D interaction into a productivity environment. This concept is extended to bridge multiple user interface dimensions by including multiple users, multiple host platforms, multiple display types, multiple concurrent applications, and a multi-context (i. e., 3D document) interface into a heterogeneous distributed environment. With this architecture, we can explore the user interface design space between pure augmented reality and the popular ubiquitous computing paradigm. We report on our design philosophy centered around the notion of contexts and locales, as well as the underlying software and hardware architecture. Contexts encapsulate a live application together with 3D (visual) and other data, while locales are used to organize geometric reference systems.

DAG Matching Techniques for Information Retrieval on Structured Documents With the establishment of international standards for document representation like SGML, ODA, or XML, attention in Information Retrieval has shifted to representation models and query languages that make active use both of the logical structure and the contents of the documents in a document database. At the same time, representation of structure has become more and more important in other types of databases as well. Among several related approaches, Kilpelainen's Tree Matching is one of the most expressive and intuitive formalisms for querying databases with treestructured entities. However, in its original formulation it leaves aside most of the problems that arise in real-life applications of Information Retrieval. In this paper we extend Tree Matching to DAG Matching and suggest various techniques that should be useful when using the formalism in a practical IR system. In particular we suggest a representation of answers that can cope with the potentially huge number of entities in...

Cross-Entropy Guided Ant-like Agents Finding Cyclic Paths in Scarcely Meshed Networks Telecommunication network owners and operators have for half a century been well aware of the potential loss of revenue if a major trunk is damaged, thus dependability at high cost has been implemented. A simple, effective and common dependability scheme is 1:1 protection with 100% capacity redundancy in the network. A growing number of applications in need of dependable connections with specific requirements to bandwidth and delay have started using the internet (which only provides best effort transport) as their base communication service. In this paper we adopt the 1:1 protection scheme and incorporate it as part of a routing system applicable for internet infrastructures. 100% capacity redundancy is no longer required. A distributed stochastic path finding (routing) algorithm based on Rubinstein's Cross Entropy method for combinatorial optimisation is presented. Early results from Monte Carlo simulations indeed indicate that the algorithm is capable of finding pairs of independent primary and backup paths satisfying specific bandwidth a constraints.

Probabilistic Temporal Databases, I: Algebra Dyreson and Snodgrass have drawn attention to the fact that in many temporal database applications,  there is often uncertainty present about the start time of events, the end time of events, the duration of  events, etc. When the granularity of time is small (e.g. milliseconds), a statement such as "Packet p  was shipped sometime during the first 5 days of January, 1998" leads to a massive amount of uncertainty  (5 \Theta 24 \Theta 60 \Theta 60 \Theta 1000)possibilities. As noted in [53], past attempts to deal with uncertainty in databases  have been restricted to relatively small amounts of uncertainty in attributes.

This special issue reviews recent research in Bayesian problem-solving techniques. The articles cover the topics of inference in Bayesian networks, decision-theoretic planning, and qualitative decision theory. Here, I provide a brief introduction to Bayesian networks and then cover applications of Bayesian problem-solving techniques, knowledge-based model construction and structured representations, and the learning of graphical probability models.

Mostly-Unsupervised Statistical Segmentation of Japanese Kanji Sequences Given the lack of word delimiters in written Japanese, word segmentation is generally considered a crucial first step in processing Japanese texts. Typical Japanese segmentation algorithms rely either on a lexicon and syntactic analysis or on pre-segmented data; but these are labor-intensive, and the lexico-syntactic techniques are vulnerable to the unknown word problem. In contrast, we introduce a novel, more robust statistical method utilizing unsegmented training data. Despite its simplicity, the algorithm yields performance on long kanji sequences comparable to and sometimes surpassing that of state-of-the-art morphological analyzers over a variety of error metrics. The algorithm also outperforms another mostly-unsupervised statistical algorithm previously proposed for Chinese. Additionally, we present a two-level annotation scheme for Japanese to incorporate multiple segmentation granularities, and introduce two novel evaluation metrics, both based on the notion of a compatible bracket, that can account for multiple granularities simultaneously.

Autonomous Bidding Agents in the Trading Agent Competition Designing agents that can bid in online simultaneous auctions is a complex task.The authors describe task-specific details and strategies of agents in a trading agent competition. Anatural offshoot of the growing prevalence of online auctions is the creation of autonomous bidding agents that monitor and participate in these auctions. It is straightforward to write a bidding agent to participate in an online auction for a single good, particularly when the value of that good is fixed ahead of time: the agent can bid slightly over the ask price until the auction closes or the price exceeds the value. In simultaneous auctions offering complementary and substitutable goods, however, agent deployment is a much more complex endeavor. The first trading agent competition (TAC), held in Boston, Massachusetts, on 8 July 2000, challenged participants to design a trading agent capable of bidding in online simultaneous auctions for complimentary and substitutable goods.

From Databases to Information Systems - Information Quality Makes the Difference Research and business is currently moving from centralized databases towards in-formation systems integrating distributed and autonomous data sources. Simultane-ously, it is a well acknowledged fact that consideration of information quality - IQ-reasoning - is an important issue for large-scale integrated information systems. We show that IQ-reasoning can be the driving force of the current shift from databases to integrated information systems. In this paper, we explore the implications and consequences of this shift. All areas of answering user queries are affected - from user input, to query planning and query optimization, and finally to building the query result. The application of IQ-reasoning brings both challenges, such as new cost models for optimization, and opportunities, such as improved query planning. We highlight several emerging aspects and suggest solutions toward a pervasion of information quality in information systems.

Design and Implementation of a Deductive Query Language for ODMG Compliant Object Databases Introduction  Deductive object-oriented databases (DOODs) seek to provide the combined support for the expressive modelling features available in the object-oriented data model and the powerful query language features available in deductive databases. When successfully engineered, this combination can broaden the spectrum of declarative queries that can be supported by the DBMS, and ease their implementation due to the increased functionality in the query capabilities of the resulting system.

The S¬≤-Tree locates subsequences within a collection of spatial sequences, i.e., sequences made up of spatial objects, such that the subsequences match a given query pattern within a specified tolerance. Our method is based on (i) the string-searching techniques that locate substrings within a string of symbols drawn from a discrete alphabet (e.g., ASCII characters) and (ii) the spatial access methods that index (unsequenced) spatial objects. Particularly, the S¬≤-Tree can be applied to solve problems such as subsequence matching of time-series data, where features of subsequences are often extracted and mapped into spatial objects. Moreover, it supports queries such as "what is the longest common pattern of the two time series?", which previous subsequence matching algorithms find difficult to solve efficiently.

Goal Directed Adaptive Behavior in Second-Order Neural Networks: The MAXSON family of architectures The paper presents a neural network architecture (MAXSON) based on second-order connections that can learn a multiple goal approach/avoid task using reinforcement from the environment. It also enables an agent to learn vicariously, from the successes and failures of other agents. The paper shows that MAXSON can learn certain spatial navigation tasks much faster than traditional Q-learning, as well as learn goal directed behavior, increasing the agent's chances of long-term survival. The paper shows that an extension of MAXSON (V-MAXSON) enables agents to learn vicariously, and this improves the overall survivability of the agent population.

View Disassembly . We explore a new form of view rewrite called view disassembly. The objective is to rewrite views in order to "remove" certain sub-views (or unfoldings) of the view. This becomes pertinent for complex views which may defined over other views and which may involve union. Such complex views arise necessarily in environments as data warehousing and mediation over heterogeneous databases. View disassembly can be used for view and query optimization, preserving data security, making use of cached queries and materialized views, and view maintenance. We provide computational complexity results of view disassembly. We show that the optimal rewrites for disassembled views is at least NP-  hard. However, we provide good news too. We provide an approximation algorithm that has much better run-time behavior. We show a pertinent class of unfoldings for which their removal always results in a simpler disassembled view than the view itself. We also show the complexity to determine when a collection...

Discovery-driven Exploration of OLAP Data Cubes .  Analysts predominantly use OLAP data cubes to identify regions of anomalies that may represent problem areas or new opportunities. The current OLAP systems support hypothesis-driven exploration of data cubes through operations such as drill-down, roll-up, and selection. Using these operations, an analyst navigates unaided through a huge search space looking at large number of values to spot exceptions. We propose a new discovery-driven exploration paradigm that mines the data for such exceptions and summarizes the exceptions at appropriate levels in advance. It then uses these exceptions to lead the analyst to interesting regions of the cube during navigation. We present the statistical foundation underlying our approach. We then discuss the computational issue of finding exceptions in data and making the process efficient on large multidimensional data bases.  1 Introduction  On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) characterizes the operations of summarizing, consolidating, viewing, a...

Layered Learning in Genetic Programming for a Cooperative Robot Soccer Problem We present an alternative to standard genetic programming (GP) that applies layered learning techniques to decompose a problem. GP is applied to subproblems sequentially, where the population in the last generation of a subproblem is used as the initial generation of the next subproblem. This method is used to evolve agents to play keep-away soccer, a subproblem of robotic soccer that requires cooperation among multiple agents in a dynamic environment. The layered learning paradigm allows GP to evolve better solutions faster than standard GP. Results show that the layered learning GP outperforms standard GP by evolving a lower fitness faster and an overall better fitness. Results indicate a wide area of future research with layered learning in GP.

Locating Objects in Mobile Computing In current distributed systems, the notion of mobility is emerging in many forms and applications.  Mobility arises naturally in wireless computing, since the location of users changes as  they move. Besides mobility in wireless computing, software mobile agents are another popular  form of moving objects. Locating objects, i.e., identifying their current location, is central to  mobile computing. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the various approaches  to the problem of storing, querying, and updating the location of objects in mobile computing.

Machine Learning based User Modeling for WWW Search The World Wide Web (Www) offers a huge number of documents which deal with information concerning nearly any topic. Thus, search engines and meta search engines currently are the key to finding information. Search engines with crawler based indexes vary in recall and offer a very bad precision. Meta search engines try to overcome these lacks by simple methods for information extraction, information filtering and integration of heterogenous information resources. Only few search engines employ intelligent techniques in order to increase precision. Recently, user modeling techniques have become more and more popular since they proved to be a useful means for user centered information filtering and presentation. Many personal agent based system for web browsing are currently developed. It is a straightforward idea to incorporate the idea of machine learning based user modeling (see [17]) methods into web search services.

Selecting a Fuzzy Logic Operation from the DNF-CNF Interval: How Practical Are the Resulting Operations? In classical (two-valued) logic, CNF and DNF  forms of each propositional formula are equivalent  to each other. In fuzzy logic, CNF and  DNF forms are not equivalent, they form an interval  that contains the fuzzy values of all classically  equivalent propositional formulas. If we  want to select a single value from this interval,  then it is natural to select a linear combination  of the interval's endpoints. In particular, we  can do that for CNF and DNF forms of "and"  and "or", thus designing natural fuzzy analogues  of classical "and" and "or" operations.

Extended Experimental Explorations Of The Necessity Of User Guidance In Case-Based Learning This is an extended report focussing on experimental results to explore the necessity of user guidance in case-based knowledge acquisition. It is covering a collection of theoretical investigations as well. The methodology of our approach is quite simple: We choose a well-understood area which is tailored to case-based knowledge acquisition. Furthermore, we choose a prototypical case-based learning algorithm which is obviously suitable for the problem domain under consideration. Then, we perform a number of knowledge acquisition experiments. They clearly exhibit essential limitations of knowledge acquisition from randomly chosen cases. As a consequence, we develop scenarios of user guidance. Based on these theoretical concepts, we prove a few theoretical results characterizing the power of our approach. Next, we perform a new series of more constrained results which support our theoretical investigations. The main experiments deal with the difficulties of learning from randomly arrange...

The Self-Organizing Map in Industry Analysis The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a powerful neural network method for the analysis and visualization of high-dimensional data. It maps nonlinear statistical relationships between high-dimensional measurement data into simple geometric relationships, usually on a two-dimensional grid. The mapping roughly preserves the most important topological and metric relationships of the original data elements and, thus, inherently clusters the data. The need for visualization and clustering occurs, for instance, in the data analysis of complex processes or systems. In various engineering applications, entire fields of industry can be investigated using SOM based methods. The data exploration tool presented in this chapter allows visualization and analysis of large data bases of industrial systems. Forest industry is the √∏rst chosen application for the tool. To illustrate the global nature of forest industry, the example case is used to cluster the pulp and paper mills of the world.

Network Processing of Mobile Agents, by Mobile Agents, for Mobile Agents . This paper presents a framework for building network protocols for  migrating mobile agents over a network. The framework allows network protocols  for agent migration to be naturally implemented within mobile agents and  to be constructed in a hierarchy as most data transmission protocols are. These  protocols are given as mobile agents and they can transmit other mobile agents  to remote hosts as first-class objects. Since they can be dynamically deployed at  remote hosts by migrating the agents that carry them, these protocols can dynamically  and flexibly customize network processing for agent migration according  to the requirements of respective visiting agents and changes in the environments.  A prototype implementation was built on a Java-based mobile agent system, and  several practical protocols for agent migration were designed and implemented.  The framework can make major contributions to mobile agent technology for  telecommunication systems.  1

Coordinating Human and Computer Agents . In many application areas individuals are responsible for an agenda of tasks and face choices about the best way to locally handle each task, in what order to do tasks, and when to do them. Such decisions are often hard to make because of coordination problems: individual tasks are related to the tasks of others in complex ways, and there are many sources of uncertainty (no one has a complete view of the task structure at arbitrary levels of detail, the situation may be changing dynamically, and no one is entirely sure of the outcomes of all of their actions). The focus of this paper is the development of support tools for distributed, cooperative work by groups (collaborative teams) of human and computational agents. We will discuss the design of a set of distributed autonomous computer programs ("agents") that assist people in coordinating their activities by helping them to manage their agendas. We describe several ongoing implementations of these ideas including 1) simulated agen...

Reasoning About Intentions in Uncertain Domains The design of autonomous agents that are situated in real  world domains involves dealing with uncertainty in terms of dynamism,  observability and non-determinism. These three types of uncertainty,  when combined with the real-time requirements of many application domains,  imply that an agent must be capable of eectively coordinating its  reasoning. As such, situated belief-desire-intention (bdi) agents need an  ecient intention reconsideration policy, which denes when computational  resources are spent on reasoning, i.e., deliberating over intentions,  and when resources are better spent on either object-level reasoning or  action. This paper presents an implementation of such a policy by modelling  intention reconsideration as a partially observable Markov decision  process (pomdp). The motivation for a pomdp implementation of intention  reconsideration is that the two processes have similar properties  and functions, as we demonstrate in this paper. Our approach achieves  better results than existing intention reconsideration frameworks, as is  demonstrated empirically in this paper.

Flying Emulator: Rapid Building and Testing of Networked Applications for Mobile Computers This paper presents a mobile-agent framework for building and testing  mobile computing applications. When a portable computing device is moved into  and attached to a new network, the proper functioning of an application running  on the device often depends on the resources and services provided locally in the  current network. To solve this problem, this framework provides an applicationlevel  emulator of portable computing devices. Since the emulator is constructed  as a mobile agent, it can carry target applications across networks on behalf of  a device, and it allows the applications to connect to local servers in its current  network in the same way as if they were moved with and executed on the device  itself. This paper also demonstrates the utility of this framework by describing  the development of typical location-dependent applications in mobile computing  settings.

A Planning Algorithm not based on Directional Search The initiative in STRIPS planning has recently been taken by work on propositional satisfiability. Best current planners, like Graphplan, and earlier planners originating in the partial-order or refinement planning community have proved in many cases to be inferior to general-purpose satisfiability algorithms in solving planning problems. However, no explanation of the success of programs like Walksat or relsat in planning has been offered. In this paper we discuss a simple planning algorithm that reconstructs the planner in the background of the SAT/CSP approach. 1 INTRODUCTION  Many of the recent interesting results in AI planning did not originate in traditional planning research, but in work on algorithms for checking the satisfiability of propositional formulae.

In particular, the studies summarized in the paper have provided evidence that users with different knowledge level of the subject may appreciate different adaptive navigation support technologies.

We combine the simple recurrent network(SRN) with the  hidden Markov models(HMM) in this approach. The improved SRN is introduced  for segmentation of continuous CSL. Outputs of SRN are regarded as the  states of HMM, and the Lattice Viterbi algorithm is employed to search the best  word sequence in the HMM framework. Experimental results show SRN/HMM  approach has better performance than the standard HMM one.

Incremental Recompilation of Knowledge Approximating a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn  envelope and Horn core, respectively) was proposed in [22] as a form of "knowledge compilation,  " supporting rapid approximate reasoning; on the negative side, this scheme is  static in that it supports no updates, and has certain complexity drawbacks pointed out  in [17]. On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature  for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments,  even in the Horn case, as was pointed out in [6], and is further demonstrated in the present  paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a  single update any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn  structure, etc.).

Supporting Conflict Management in Cooperative Design Teams The design of complex artifacts has increasingly become a cooperative process, with the detection and resolution of conflicts between design agents playing a central role. Effective tools for supporting the conflict management process, however, are still lacking.

Every design agent is provided with an "assistant" that provides domain-independent conflict detection, classification and resolution expertise. The design agents provide the domainspecific expertise needed to instantiate this general expertise, including the rationale for their actions, as a part of their design activities.

A Reactive-Deliberative Model of Dialogue Agency . For an agent to engage in substantive dialogues with other agents, there are several complexities which go beyond the scope of standard models of rational agency. In particular, an agent must reason about social attitudes that span more than one agent, as well as the dynamic and fallible process of plan execution. In this paper we sketch a theory of plan execution which allows the representation of failure and repair, extend the underlying agency model with social attitudes of mutual belief, obligation, and multi-agent plan execution, and describe an implemented dialogue agent which uses these notions, reacting to its environment and mental state, and deliberating and planning action only when more pressing concerns are absent. 1 Overview  For autonomous agents that operate in a realm of heterogeneous agents (including human agents), an agent theory should allow many of the features of natural language dialogue. The agent communication protocols should allow flexible turn-taking and ...

Multi-modal Identity Verification using Support Vector Machines (SVM) The contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) to formulate a decision fusion problem encountered in the design of a multi-modal identity verification system as a particular classification problem, (2) to propose to solve this problem by a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The multi-modal identity verification system under consideration is built of d modalities in parallel, each one delivering as output a scalar number, called score, stating how well the claimed identity is verified. A fusion module receiving as input the d scores has to take a binary decision: accept or reject identity. This fusion problem has been solved using Support Vector Machines. The performances of this fusion module have been evaluated and compared with other proposed methods on a multimodal database, containing both vocal and visual modalities.

Soft Computing and Fault Management Soft computing is a partnership between A.I. techniques that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty and partial truth, with the aim of obtaining a robust solution for complex systems. Telecommunication systems are built with extensive redundancy and complexity to ensure robustness and quality of service. To facilitate this requires complex fault identification and management systems. Fault identification and management is generally handled by reducing the amount of alarm events (symptoms) presented to the operating engineer through monitoring, filtering and masking. The ultimate goal is to determine and present the actual underlying fault. Fault Management is a complex task subject to uncertainty in the 'symptoms' presented and as such is ideal for treatment by soft computing techniques. The aim of this paper is to present a soft computing approach to fault management in telecommunication systems. Two key approaches are considered; AI & soft computing rule discovery and techniques to attempt to present less symptoms with greater diagnostic assistance for the more traditional rule based system approach and a hybrid soft computing approach which utilises a genetic algorithm to learn Bayesian belief networks (BBNs). It is also highlighted that research and development of the two target Fault Management Systems are complementary.

Efficient Goal Directed Bottom-up Evaluation of Logic Programs This paper introduces a new strategy for the efficient goal directed bottomup evaluation of logic programs. Instead of combining a standard bottomup evaluation strategy with a Magic-set transformation, the evaluation strategy is specialized for the application to Magic-set programs which are characterized by clause bodies with a high degree of overlapping. The approach is similar to other techniques which avoid re-computation by maintaining and reusing partial solutions to clause bodies. However, the overhead is considerably reduced as these are maintained implicitly by the underlying Prolog implementation. The technique is presented as a simple meta-interpreter for goal directed bottom-up evaluation. No Magic-set transformation is involved as the dependencies between calls and answers are expressed directly within the interpreter. The proposed technique has been implemented and shown to provide substantial speed-ups in applications of semantic based program analysis based on bottom-up...

The paper then briefly introduces the notion of virtual organizations and uses the set-up stage of virtual organizations to exemplify the value-adding potential of KIDEs in knowledge management contexts.

A given ontology is incrementally updated as new concepts are acquired from real-world texts.

Modeling Spatial Dependencies for Mining Geospatial Data: An Introduction Spatial data mining is a process to discover interesting, potentially useful and high utility  patterns embedded in spatial databases. Efficient tools for extracting information from spatial  data sets can be of importance to organizations which own, generate and manage large spatial  data sets. The current approach towards solving spatial data mining problems is to use classical  data mining tools after "materializing" spatial relationships. However, the key property of  spatial data is that of spatial autocorrelation. Like temporal data, spatial data values are  influenced by values in their immediate vicinity. Ignoring spatial autocorrelation in the modeling  process leads to results which are a poor-fit and unreliable. In this chapter we will first review  spatial statistical techniques which explictly model spatial autocorrelation. Second, we will  propose PLUMS(Predicting Locations Using Map Similarity), a new approach for supervised  spatial data mining problems. PLUMS searches the space of solutions using a map-similarity  measure which is more appropriate in the context of spatial data. We will show that compared  to state-of-the-art spatial statistics approaches, PLUMS achives comparable accuracy but at  a fraction of the computational cost. Furthermore, PLUMS provides a general framework for  specializing other data mining techniques for mining spatial data.

Heterogeneous Active Agents, III: Polynomially Implementable Agents . In (Eiter, Subrahmanian, and Pick 1999), the authors have introduced techniques to build agents on top of arbitrary data structures, and to "agentize" new/existing programs. They provided a series of successively more sophisticated semantics for such agent systems, and showed that as these semantics become epistemically more desirable, a computational price may need to be paid. In this paper, we identify a class of agents that are called weak regular---this is done by first identifying a fragment of agent programs (Eiter, Subrahmanian, and Pick 1999) called weak regular agent programs  (WRAPs for short). It is shown that WRAPs are definable via three parameters---checking for a property called "safety", checking for a property called "conflict freedom" and checking for a "deontic stratifiability" property. Algorithms for each of these are developed. A weak regular agent is then defined in terms of these concepts , and a regular agent is one that satisfies an additional "boundedness" ...

Wrapper Induction: Efficiency and Expressiveness (Extended Abstract) Recently, many systems have been built that automatically interact with Internet information resources. However, these resources are usually formatted for use by people; e.g., the relevant content is embedded in HTML pages. Wrappers are often used to extract a resource's content, but hand-coding wrappers is tedious and error-prone. We advocate wrapper induction,  a technique for automatically constructing wrappers. We have identified several wrapper classes that can be learned quickly (most sites require only a handful of examples, consuming a few CPU seconds of processing), yet which are useful for handling numerous Internet resources (70% of surveyed sites can be handled by our techniques).

SpiderServer: the MetaSearch Engine of WebNaut Search engines on the Web are valuable tools for searching information according to a user's interests whether an individual or a software agent. In the present article we describe the design and the operation mode of SpiderServer, a metasearch engine used for the submission of a query followed by the retrieving of results from five popular search engines. SpiderServer is the metasearch engine of the WebNaut system but it can be easily used by any other metasearch platform. There are two files for every search engine describing the phases of query formation and filtering respectively. These files contain directions on the way a query must be modified for a specific search engine and on the methodology SpiderServer must follow in order to parse the results from the specific search engine. The ultimate goal is to construct platform independent meta-search engines, which can be easily programmed to adapt to any search engine available on the WEB.

Statistical Modeling of Human Interactions In this paper we describe a real-time computer vision and machine learning system for modeling and recognizing human behaviors in a visual surveillance task. The system is particularly concerned with detecting when interactions between people occur, and classifying the type of interaction. Examples of interesting interaction behaviors include following another person, altering one's path to meet another, and so forth.  Our system combines top-down with bottom-up information in a closed feedback loop, with both components employing a statistical Bayesian approach. We propose and compare two different state-based learning architectures, namely HMMs and CHMMs, for modeling behaviors and interactions. The CHMM model is shown to work much more efficiently and accurately.  Finally, a synthetic agent training system is used to develop a priori models for recognizing human behaviors and interactions. We demonstrate the ability to use these a priori models to accurately classify real human beha...

Statistical Models for Text Segmentation Abstract. This paper introduces a new statistical approach to automatically partitioning text into coherent segments. The approach is based on a technique that incrementally builds an exponential model to extract features that are correlated with the presence of boundaries in labeled training text. The models use two classes of features: topicality features that use adaptive language models in a novel way to detect broad changes of topic, and cue-word features that detect occurrences of specific words, which may be domain-specific, that tend to be used near segment boundaries. Assessment of our approach on quantitative and qualitative grounds demonstrates its effectiveness in two very different domains, Wall Street Journal news articles and television broadcast news story transcripts. Quantitative results on these domains are presented using a new probabilistically motivated error metric, which combines precision and recall in a natural and flexible way. This metric is used to make a quantitative assessment of the relative contributions of the different feature types, as well as a comparison with decision trees and previously proposed text segmentation algorithms. 1.

Storing e-mail messages into hierarchically organized folders, where each folder corresponds to a separate topic, has proven to be very useful.  Previous approaches to this problem use Nave Bayes- or TF-IDF-style classifiers that are based on the unrealistic term independence assumption. These methods are also context-insensitive in that the meaning of words is independent of presence/absence of other words in the same message. It was shown that text classification methods that deviate from the independence assumption and capture context achieve higher accuracy. In this thesis, we address the problem of term dependence by building an associative classifier called Classification using Cohesion and Multiple Association Rules, or COMAR in short. The problem of context capturing is addressed by looking for phrases in message corpora. Both rules and phrases are generated using an efficient FP-growth-like approach. Since the amount of rules and phrases produced can be very large, we propose two new measures, rule cohesion and phrase cohesion, that possess the anti-monotone property which allows the push of rule and phrase pruning deeply into the process of their generation. This approach to pattern pruning proves to be much more efficient than "generate-and-prune" methods.  Both unstructured text attributes and semi-structured non-text attributes, such as senders and recipients, are used for the classification. COMAR classification algorithm uses multiple rules to predict several highest probability topics for each message. Different feature selection and rule ranking methods are compared. Our studies show ...

An Architecture for Outdoor Wearable Computers to Support Augmented Reality and Multimedia Applications This paper describes an architecture to support a hardware and software platform for research into the use of wearable computers and augmented reality in an outdoor environment. The architecture supports such devices as a GPS, compass, and head-mounted display. A prototype system was built to support novel applications by drawing graphics (such as maps, building plans, and compass bearings) on the head-mounted display, projecting information over that normally seen by the user and hence augmenting a user's perception of reality. This paper presents a set of novel augmented reality and multimedia applications operated in an outdoor environment.  1

Term Selection for Filtering based on Distribution of Terms over Time In this article we investigate the use of time distributions in retrieval tasks. Specifically, we introduce a novel term selection method, namely Term Occurrence Uniformity (TOU), based on the hypothesis that terms which occur uniformly in time are more valuable than others. Our empirical evaluation so far has neither proved nor disproved this hypothesis. However, results are promising and suggest the need for a deeper theoretical and empirical investigation. Our current concern is filtering, but this line of research may easily be extended to other retrieval tasks which involve temporally-dependent data.  1 Introduction  Information Filtering is the process of searching in large amounts of data for information which matches a user information need. The filtering task is usually described as the inverse of the traditional retrieval task. In retrieval, a one-time user request (called query) is matched to a static collection of information objects. In filtering, users issue a long-term r...

Hybrid Methods Using Evolutionary Algorithms for On-line Training A novel hybrid evolutionary approach is presented in this paper for improving the performance of neural network classifiers in slowly varying environments. For this purpose, we investigate a coupling of Differential Evolution Strategy and Stochastic Gradient Descent, using both the global search capabilities of Evolutionary Strategies and the effectiveness of on-line gradient descent. The use of Differential Evolution Strategy is related to the concept of evolution of a number of individuals from generation to generation and that of on-line gradient descent to the concept of adaptation to the environment by learning. The hybrid algorithm is tested in two real-life image processing applications. Experimental results suggest that the hybrid strategy is capable to train on-line effectively leading to networks with increased generalization capability.

Unbiased Evaluation of Retrieval Quality using Clickthrough Data This paper proposes a new method for evaluating the quality of retrieval functions. Unlike traditional methods that require relevance judgements by experts or explicit user feedback, it is based entirely on clickthrough data. This is a key advantage, since clickthrough data can be collected at very low cost and without overhead for the user. Taking an approach from experiment design, the paper proposes an experiment setup that generates unbiased feedback about the relative quality of two search results without explicit user feedback. A theoretical analysis shows that the method gives the same results as evaluation with traditional relevance judgements under mild statistical assumptions. An empirical analysis verifies that the assumptions are indeed justified and that the new method leads to conclusive results in a WWW retrieval study.

Towards Automatic Discovery of Object Categories We propose a method to learn heterogeneous models of object classes for visual recognition. The training images contain a preponderance of clutter and learning is unsupervised. Our models represent objects as probabilistic constellations of rigid parts (features). The variability within a class is represented by a joint probability density function on the shape of the constellation and the appearance of the parts. Our method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set. The set of model parameters is then learned using expectation maximization (see the companion paper [11] for details). When trained on different, unlabeled and unsegmented views of a class of objects, each component of the mixture model can adapt to represent a subset of the views. Similarly, different component models can also "specialize" on sub-classes of an object class. Experiments on images of human heads, leaves from different species of trees, and motor-cars demonstrate that the method works...

A Scalable Integrated Region-Based Image Retrieval System Statistical clustering is critical in designing scalable image retrieval systems. In this paper, we presentascalable algorithm for indexing and retrieving images based on region segmentation. The method uses statistical clustering on region features and IRM (Integrated Region Matching), a measure developed to evaluate overall similaritybetween images that incorporates properties of all the regions in the images by a region-matching scheme. Compared with retrieval based on individual regions, our overall similarity approach (a) reduces the inuence of inaccurate segmentation, (b) helps to clarify the semantics of a particular region, and (c) enables a simple querying interface for region-based image retrieval systems. The algorithm has been implemented as a part of our experimental SIMPLIcity image retrieval system and tested on large-scale image databases of both general-purpose images and pathology slides. Experiments have demonstrated that this technique maintains the accuracy and robustness of the original system while reducing the matching time significantly.

CaseLP provides a set of languages for modeling intelligent  and interacting components (agents) at different levels of abstraction. It also furnishes  tools for integrating legacy software into a prototype.  The possibility of integrating, into the same executable prototype, agents which are only  specified as well as already developed components can prove extremely useful in the engineering  process of complex applications. In fact, the reusability of existing components can be verified  before the application has been implemented and the developer can be more confident on the  correctness of the new components specification, if it has been executed and tested by means  of an interaction with the existing components.  Besides the aspects of integration and reuse, CaseLP also faces another fundamental issue of  nowadays applications, namely distribution. The...

Evaluating Strategies for Similarity Search on the Web Finding pages on the Web that are similar to a query page (Related Pages) is an important component of modern search engines. A variety of strategies have been proposed for answering Related Pages queries, but comparative evaluation by user studies is expensive, especially when large strategy spaces must be searched (e.g., when tuning parameters). We present a technique for automatically evaluating strategies using Web hierarchies, such as Open Directory, in place of user feedback. We apply this evaluation methodology to a mix of document representation strategies, including the use of text, anchor-text, and links. We discuss the relative advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches examined. Finally, we describe how to efficiently construct a similarity index out of our chosen strategies, and provide sample results from our index.

A glimpse into the future of ID Cyberspace is a complex dimension of both enabling and inhibiting data flows in electronic data networks. Current generation intrusion detection (ID) systems are not technologically advanced enough to create the situational knowledge required to manage these networks. Next generation ID system will fuse data, combining both short-term sensor data with long-term knowledge databases, to create cyberspace situational awareness. This article offers a glimpse into the foggy crystal ball of future ID systems. Before diving into the technical discussion we ask the reader to keep in mind the generic model of a datagram traversing the Internet. Figure 1 illustrates an IP datagram moving in a store-and-forward environment from source to destination; routed based on a destination address with a uncertain source address decrementing the datagram time-to-live (TTL) at every router hop [1]. The datagram is routed through major Internets and IP transit providers. There is striking similarity between the transit of a datagram in the Internet and an airplane through airspace; future network management and air traffic control. At a very high abstract level, the concepts used to monitor objects in airspace apply to monitoring objects in networks. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) divides airspace management into two distinct entities. On the one hand, local controllers guide aircraft into and out of the air space surrounding an airport. Their job is to maintain awareness of the location of all aircraft in their vicinity, ensure proper separation, identify threats to aircraft, and manage the overall safety of passengers. Functionally, this is similar to the role of network controllers who must control the environment within their administrative domains. The network administrator must ensure the proper ports are open and the information is not delayed, the collisions are kept to a minimum, and the integrity of the delivery systems are not compromised. This is naturally similar to the situational awareness required in current generation air traffic control (ATC).

How to Avoid Building DataBlades That Know the Value of Everything and the Cost of Nothing The object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) offers many potential benefits for scientific, multimedia and financial applications. However, work remains in the integration of domain-specific class libraries (data cartridges, extenders, DataBlades  ¬Æ  ) into ORDBMS query processing. A major problem is that the standard mechanisms for query selectivity estimation, taken from relational database systems, rely on properties specific to the standard data types; creation of new mechanisms remains extremely difficult because the software interfaces provided by vendors are relatively low-level. In this paper, we discuss extensions of the generalized search tree, or GiST, to support a higher-level but less type-specific approach. Specifically, we discuss the computation of selectivity estimates with confidence intervals using a variety of index-based approaches and present results from an experimental comparison of these methods with several estimators from the literature. 1.

HyperQueries: Dynamic Distributed Query Processing on the Internet In this paper we propose a new framework for  dynamic distributed query processing based  on so-called HyperQueries which are essentially  query evaluation sub-plans "sitting behind  " hyperlinks. We illustrate the flexibility  of this distributed query processing architecture  in the context of B2B electronic market  places. Architecting an electronic market  place as a data warehouse by integrating all  thedatafromall participating enterprises in  one centralized repository incurs severe problems.  Using HyperQueries, application integration  is achieved via dynamic distributed  query evaluation plans. The electronic market  place serves as an intermediary between clients  and providers executing their sub-queries referenced  via hyperlinks. The hyperlinks are embedded  within data objects of the intermediary  's database. Retrieving such a virtual object  will automatically initiate the execution of the  referenced HyperQuery in order to materialize  the entire object. Thus, sensitive data remains  under the full control of the data providers.  1

The Shape of the Web and Its Implications for Searching the Web With the rapid growth of the number of web pages, designing a search engine that can retrieve high quality information in response to a user query is a challenging task. Automated search engines that rely on keyword matching usually return too many low quality matches and they take a long time to run. It is argued in the literature that link-following search methods can substantially increase the search quality, provided that these methods use an accurate assumption about useful patterns in the hyperlink topology of the web. Recent work in the field has focused on detecting identi able patterns in the web graph and exploiting this information to improve the performance of search algorithms. We survey relevant work in this area and comment on the implications of these patterns for other areas such as advertisement and marketing.

Detection and Correction of Conflicting Concurrent Data Warehouse Updates Data integration over multiple heterogeneous data sources has become increasingly important for modern applications. The integrated data is usually stored in materialized views to allow better access, performance and high availability. Materialized view must be maintained after the data sources change. In a loosely-coupled environment, such as the Data Grid, the data sources are autonomous. Hence the source updates can be concurrent and cause erroneous maintenance results. State-of-the-art maintenance strategies apply compensating queries to correct such errors, making the restricting assumption that all source schemata remain static over time. However, in such dynamic environments, the data sources may change not only their data but also their schema, query capabilities or semantics. Consequently, either the maintenance queries or compensating queries would fail. We now propose a novel solution that handles both concurrent data and schema changes. First, we analyze the concurrency between source updates and classify them into different classes of dependencies. We then propose Dyno, a two-pronged strategy composed of dependency detection and correction algorithms to handle these new classes of concurrency. Our techniques are not tied to specific maintenance algorithms nor to a particular data model. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive solution to the view maintenance concurrency problems in loosely-coupled environments. Our experimental results illustrate that Dyno imposes an almost negligible overhead on existing maintenance algorithms for data updates while now allowing for this extended functionality.

The evaluation algorithm is polynomial under combined  complexity.  EquiX combines pattern matching, quantification and logical expressions to query both  the data and meta-data of XML documents. The result of a query in EquiX is a set of XML  documents. A DTD describing the result documents is derived automatically from the query.  1

A System for Extraction of Temporal Expressions from French Texts We present a system for extraction of temporal expressions from French texts.

Closing the Loop: an Agenda- and Justification-Based Framework for Selecting the Next Discovery Task to Perform We propose and evaluate an agenda- and justificationbased  architecture for discovery systems that contains  a mechanism for selecting the next task to perform.

We evaluate the extent to which both reasons and  estimates of interestingness contribute to performance  in the domain of protein crystallization. With both  aspects contributing to task selection, a high fraction  of discoveries by the HAMB prototype were judged  interesting by an expert (21% interesting and novel;  45% interesting but rediscoveries).  1.

Dynamic Logic Programming In this paper we investigate updates of knowledge bases represented by logic programs. In order to represent negative information, we use generalized logic programs which allow default negation not only in rule bodies but also in their heads.We start by introducing the notion of an update $P\oplus U$ of a logic program $P$ by another logic program $U$. Subsequently, we provide a precise semantic characterization of $P\oplus U$, and study some basic properties of program updates. In particular, we show that our update programs generalize the notion of interpretation update. We then extend this notion to compositional sequences of logic programs updates $P_{1}\oplus P_{2}\oplus \dots $, defining a dynamic program update, and thereby introducing the paradigm of \emph{dynamic logic programming}. This paradigm significantly facilitates modularization of logic programming, and thus modularization of non-monotonic reasoning as a whole. Specifically, suppose that we are given a set of logic program modules, each describing a different state of our knowledge of the world. Different states may represent different time points or different sets of priorities or perhaps even different viewpoints. Consequently, program modules may contain mutually contradictory as well as overlapping information. The role of the dynamic program update is to employ the mutual relationships existing between different modules to precisely determine, at any given module composition stage, the declarative as well as the procedural semantics of the combined program resulting from the modules.

Information Extraction with HMMs and Shrinkage Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a powerful probabilistic tool for modeling time series data, and have been applied with success to many language-related tasks such as part of speech tagging, speech recognition, text segmentation and topic detection. This paper describes the application of HMMs to another language related task|information extraction|the problem of locating textual sub-segments that answer a particular information need. In our work, the HMM state transition probabilities and word emission probabilities are learned from labeled training data. As in many machine learning problems, however, the lack of su√Ücient labeled training data hinders the reliability of the model. The key contribution of this paper is the use of a statistical technique called \shrinkage" that signi cantly improves parameter estimation of the HMM emission probabilities in the face of sparse training data.

A Simple Heuristic Based Genetic Algorithm for the Maximum Clique Problem This paper proposes a novel heuristic based genetic algorithm  (HGA) for the maximum clique problem, which consists of the combination of a simple genetic algorithm and a naive heuristic algorithm. The heuristic based genetic algorithm is tested on the so-called DIMACS benchmark graphs, with up to 4000 nodes and up to 5506380 edges, consisting of randomly generated graphs with known maximum clique and of graphs derived from various practical applications. The performance of HGA on these graphs is very satisfactory both in terms of solution quality and running time. Despite its simplicity, HGA dramatically improves on all previous approaches based on genetic algorithms we are aware of, and yields results comparable to those of more involved heuristic algorithms based on local search. This provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness of heuristic based genetic algorithms as a search technique for solving the maximum clique problem, which is competitive with respect to other (variants...

Flexibly Instructable Agents This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a exible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this exibility, however, the agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of exible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation speci ed in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks. 1.

The Use of Classifiers in Sequential Inference We study the problem of combining the outcomes of several different  classifiers in a way that provides a coherent inference that satisfies some  constraints. In particular, we develop two general approaches for an important  subproblem - identifying phrase structure. The first is a Markovian  approach that extends standard HMMs to allow the use of a rich observation  structure and of general classifiers to model state-observation  dependencies. The second is an extension of constraint satisfaction formalisms.  We develop efficient combination algorithms under both models  and study them experimentally in the context of shallow parsing.  1 Introduction  In many situations it is necessary to make decisions that depend on the outcomes of several different classifiers in a way that provides a coherent inference that satisfies some constraints - the sequential nature of the data or other domain specific constraints.

A Scalable, Distributed Middleware Service Architecture to Support Mobile Internet Applications Middleware layers placed between user clients and application servers have been used to perform a variety of functions. In previous work we have used middleware to perform a new capability, application session handoff, using a single Middleware Server to provide all functionality. However, to improve the scalability of our architecture, we have designed an efficient distributed Middleware Service layer that properly maintains application session handoff semantics while being able to service a large number of clients. We show that this service layer improves the scalability of general clientto -application server interaction as well as the specific case of application session handoff. We detail protocols involved in performing handoff and analyse an implementation of the architecture that supports the use of a real medical teaching tool. From experimental results it can be seen that our Middleware Service effectively provides scalability as a response to increased workload.  1.

Generic Schema Matching with Cupid Schema matching is a critical step in many applications,  such as XML message mapping, data warehouse  loading, and schema integration. In this paper, we  investigate algorithms for generic schema matching,  outside of any particular data model or application. We  first present a taxonomy for past solutions, showing  that a rich range of techniques is available. We then  propose a new algorithm, Cupid, that discovers mappings  between schema elements based on their names,  data types, constraints, and schema structure, using a  broader set of techniques than past approaches. Some  of our innovations are the integrated use of linguistic  and structural matching, context-dependent matching  of shared types, and a bias toward leaf structure where  much of the schema content resides. After describing  our algorithm, we present experimental results that  compare Cupid to two other schema matching systems.

Defining and Combining Symmetric and Asymmetric Similarity Measures . In this paper, we present a framework for the definition of similarity measures using lattice-valued functions. We show their strengths (particularly for combining similarity measures). Then we investigate a particular instantiation of the framework, in which sets are used both to represent objects and to denote degrees of similarity. The paper concludes by suggesting some generalisations of the findings. 1 Introduction  There are many different ways of computing the similarity of object representations. These include:  -- the feature-based approach, in which objects are represented by sets of features, and similarity is based on feature commonality and difference (e.g. [13]);  -- the geometric approach, in which objects are represented by points in an n-  dimensional space (usually specified by sets of pairs of attributes and atomic values), and similarity is based on the inverse of the distance between objects in the space (e.g. [12]); and  -- the structural approach, which uses gr...

Optimal Design of Neural Nets Using Hybrid Algorithms Selection of the topology of a network and correct parameters for the  learning algorithm is a tedious task for designing an optimal Artificial Neural  Network (ANN), which is smaller, faster and with a better generalization  performance. Genetic algorithm (GA) is an adaptive search technique based on  the principles and mechanisms of natural selection and survival of the fittest  from natural evolution. Simulated annealing (SA) is a global optimization  algorithm that can process cost functions possessing quite arbitrary degrees of  nonlinearities, discontinuities and stochasticity but statistically assuring a  optimal solution. In this paper we explain how a hybrid algorithm integrating  the desirable aspects of GA and SA can be applied for the optimal design of an  ANN. This paper is more concerned with the understanding of current  theoretical developments of Evolutionary Artificial Neural Networks (EANNs)  using GAs and other heuristic procedures and how the proposed hybrid and  other heuristic procedures can be combined to produce an optimal ANN.

Similar to widgets, phidgets abstract and package input and output devices: they hide implementation and construction details, they expose functionality through a well-defined API, and they have an (optional) on-screen interactive interface for displaying and controlling device state. Unlike widgets, phidgets also require: a connection manager to track how devices appear on-line; a way to link a software phidget with its physical counterpart; and a simulation mode to allow the programmer to develop, debug and test a physical interface even when no physical device is present. Our evaluation shows that everyday programmers using phidgets can rapidly develop physical interfaces.

Evaluating Top-k Queries over Web-Accessible Databases A query to a web search engine usually consists of a list of keywords, to which the search engine responds with the best or ‚Äútop ‚Äù k pages for the query. This top-k query model is prevalent over multimedia collections in general, but also over plain relational data for certain applications. For example, consider a relation with information on available restaurants, including their location, price range for one diner, and overall food rating. A user who queries such a relation might simply specify the user‚Äôs location and target price range, and expect in return the best 10 restaurants in terms of some combination of proximity to the user, closeness of match to the target price range, and overall food rating. Processing top-k queries efficiently is challenging for a number of reasons. One critical such reason is that, in many web applications, the relation attributes might not be available other than through external web-accessible form interfaces, which we will have to query repeatedly for a potentially large set of candidate objects. In this article, we study how to process top-k queries efficiently in this setting, where the attributes for which users specify target values might be handled by external, autonomous sources with a variety of access interfaces. We present a sequential algorithm for processing such queries, but observe that any sequential top-k query processing strategy is bound to require unnecessarily long query processing times, since web accesses exhibit high and variable latency. Fortunately, web sources can be probed in parallel, and each source can typically process concurrent requests, although sources may impose some restrictions on the type and number of probes that they are willing to accept. We adapt our sequential query processing technique and introduce an efficient algorithm that maximizes source-access parallelism to minimize query response time, while satisfying source-access constraints.

Theseus: Categorization by Context Introduction The traditional approach to document categorization is categorization by content, since information for categorizing a document is extracted from the document itself. In a hypertext environment like the Web, the structure of documents and the link topology can be exploited to perform what we call categorization by context [Attardi 98]: the context surrounding a link in an HTML document is used for categorizing the document referred by the link. Categorization by context is capable of dealing also with multimedia material, since it does not rely on the ability to analyze the content of documents. Categorization by context leverages on the categorization activity implicitly performed when someone places or refers to a document on the Web. By focusing the analysis to the documents used by a group of people, one can build a catalogue tuned to the need of that group. Categorization by context is based on the following assumptions: 1

Concept Network: A Structure for Context Sensitive Document Representation In this paper we propose a directed acyclic graphical structure called concept network  (CNW) for context sensitive document representation for use in information filtering.  Nodes of CNW represent concepts and links represent the relationships between  the concepts. A concept can either be a phrase or a topic of discourse, or a mode of  discourse. An important feature of the CNW based scheme (CNWBS) is context filters  [Murthy and Keerthi, 1999] which are employed on the links of the graph to enable context  sensitive analysis and representation of documents. Context filters are intended to  filter the noise in the inputs of the concepts based on the context of appearance of their  inputs. The CNWBS automatically finds the paragraphs related to all concepts in the  document. It also provides good comprehensibility in representation; allows sharing of  CNW among a group of users; and, reduces the credit-assignment problem during its construction.  This representation scheme is used for...

Multimodal Interactions with Agents in Virtual Worlds Introduction  World Wide Web allows interactions and transactions through Web pages using speech and language, either by inanimate or live agents, image interpretation and generation, and, of course the more traditional ways of presenting explicitly predefined information of text, tables, figures, pictures, audio, animation and video. In a task- or domain-oriented way of interaction current technology allows the recognition and interpretation of rather natural speech and language in dialogues. However, rather than the current two-dimensional web-pages, many interesting parts of the Web will become three-dimensional, allowing the building of virtual worlds inhabited by user and task agents, with which the user can interact using different types of modalities, including speech and language interpretation and generation. Agents can work on behalf of users, hence, human computer interaction will make use of `indirect management', rather than interacting through direct manipulation of data

A Logic of BDI Agents with Procedural Knowledge In this paper, we present a new logic for specifying the behaviour of multi-agent systems. In this logic, agents are viewed as BDI systems, in that their state is characterised in terms of beliefs, desires, and intentions: the semantics of the BDI component of the logic are based on the wellknown system of Rao and Georgeff. In addition, agents have available to them a library of plans, representing their `know-how': procedural knowledge about how to achieve their intentions. These plans are, in effect, programs, that specify how a group of agents can work in parallel to achieve certain ends. The logic provides a rich set of constructs for describing the structure and execution of plans. Some properties of the logic are investigated, (in particular, those relating to plans), and some comments on future work are presented. 1 Introduction  There is currently much international interest in computer systems that go under the banner of intelligent agents [17].

Partial Answers for Unavailable Data Sources Abstract. Many heterogeneous database system products and prototypes exist today; they will soon be deployed in a wide variety of environments. Most existing systems suffer from an Achilles ‚Äô heel: they ungracefully fail in presence of unavailable data sources. If some data sources are unavailable when accessed, these systems either silently ignore them or generate an error. This behavior is improper in environments where there is a non-negligible probability that data sources cannot be accessed (e.g., Internet). In case some data sources cannot be accessed when processing a query, the complete answer to this query cannot be computed; some work can however be done with the data sources that are available. In this paper, we propose a novel approach where, in presence of unavailable data sources, the answer to a query is a partial answer. A partial answer is a representation of the work that has been done in case the complete answer to a query cannot be computed, and of the work that remains to be done in order to obtain this complete answer. The use of a partial answer is twofold. First, it contains an incremental query that allows to obtain the complete answer without redoing the work that has already been done. Second, the application program can extract information from a partial answer through the use of a secondary query, which we call a parachute query. In this paper, we present a framework for partial answers and we propose three algorithms for the evaluation of queries in presence of unavailable sources, the construction of incremental queries and the evaluation of parachute queries. 1

The goal of ARC is to compile resource lists similar to those provided by Yahoo! or Infoseek. The fundamental difference is that these services construct lists either manually or through a combination of human and automated effort, while ARC operates fully automatically. We describe the evaluation of ARC, Yahoo!, and Infoseek resource lists by a panel of human users. This evaluation suggests that the resources found by ARC frequently fare almost as well as, and sometimes better than, lists of resources that are manually compiled or classified into a topic. We also provide examples of ARC resource lists for the reader to examine.

Efficiently Supporting Temporal Granularities Abstract√êGranularity is an integral feature of temporal data. For instance, a person's age is commonly given to the granularity of years and the time of their next airline flight to the granularity of minutes. A granularity creates a discrete image, in terms of granules,of a (possibly continuous) time-line. We present a formal model for granularity in temporal operations that is integrated with temporal indeterminacy, or ¬™don't know when¬∫ information. We also minimally extend the syntax and semantics of SQL-92 to support mixed granularities. This support rests on two operations, scale and cast, that move times between granularities, e.g., from days to months. We demonstrate that our solution is practical by showing how granularities can be specified in a modular fashion, and by outlining a time- and space-efficient implementation. The implementation uses several optimization strategies to mitigate the expense of accommodating multiple granularities.

Towards a Comprehensive Topic Hierarchy for News To date, a comprehensive, Yahoo-like hierarchy of topics has yet to be offered for the domain of news. The Yahoo approach of managing such a hierarchy --- hiring editorial staff to read documents and correctly assign them to topics --- is simply not practical in the domain of news. Far too many stories are written and made available online everyday.  While many Machine Learning methods exist for organising documents into topics, these methods typically require a large number of labelled training examples before performing accurately. When managing a large and ever-changing topic hierarchy, it is unlikely that there would be enough time to provide many examples per topic. For this reason, it would be useful to identify extra information within the domain of news that could be harnessed to minimise the number of labelled examples required to achieve reasonable accuracy.  To this end, the notion of a semi-labelled document is introduced. These documents, which are partially labelled by th...

Jacob project - Documentation The Jacob software system has been built as part of the Jacob project, which is a pilot project of the Virtual Reality Valley Twente initiative. The Jacob project investigates the application of virtual reality techniques and involves the design and construction of an animated agent in a 3-dimensional virtual environment. The project focuses on software engineering aspects, multimodal interaction, and the use of agent technology. In the current version of the Jacob system, an agent called Jacob teaches the user the Towers of Hanoi game; interaction takes place through natural language and manipulations of objects in the virtual environment. The purpose of this report is to provide information needed for further development of the Jacob system. It describes a number of technical details, including the file and directory structure, the software architecture, the event handling mechanism, and the integration of the dialogue management system.  3  Table of Contents 1 Introduction ...........

Learning Nonlinear Dynamical Systems using an EM Algorithm The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative procedure for maximum likelihood parameter estimation from data sets with missing or hidden variables[2]. It has been applied to system identification in linear stochastic state-space models, where the state variables are hidden from the observer and both the state and the parameters of the model have to be estimated simultaneously [9]. We present a generalization of the EM algorithm for parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamical systems. The "expectation" step makes use of Extended Kalman Smoothing to estimate the state, while the "maximization" step re-estimates the parameters using these uncertain state estimates. In general, the nonlinear maximization step is difficult because it requires integrating out the uncertainty in the states. However, if Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) approximators are used to model the nonlinearities, the integrals become tractable and the maximization step can be solved via systems of linear equations.

Experiences with Selecting Search Engines using Meta-Search Search engines are among the most useful and high profile resources on the Internet. The problem of finding information on the Internet has been replaced with the problem of knowing where search engines are, what they are designed to retrieve and how to use them. This paper describes and evaluates SavvySearch, a meta-search engine designed to intelligently select and interface with multiple remote search engines. The primary meta-search issue examined is the importance of carefully selecting and ranking remote search engines for user queries. We studied the efficacy of SavvySearch's incrementally acquired meta-index approach to selecting search engines by analyzing the effect of time and experience on performance. We also compared the meta-index approach to the simpler categorical approach and showed how much experience is required to surpass the simple scheme.  1 Introduction  Search engines are powerful tools for assisting the otherwise unmanageable task of navigating the rapidly ex...

A Contract Decommitment Protocol for Automated Negotiation in Time Variant Environments Negotiation is a fundamental mechanism in distributed multi-agent systems. Since negotiation is a time-spending process, in many scenarios agents have to take into account the passage of time and to react to uncertain events. The possibility to decommit from a contract is considered a powerful technique to manage this aspect. This paper considers interactions among self-interested and autonomous agent, each with their own utility function, and focuses on incomplete information. We define a negotiation model based on asynchronous message passing in which the negotiation doesn't end when an agreement is reached but when the consequences of the contract have happened -- i.e. the action is done. In this model the agent utility functions are time dependent. We present an extension of the contract net protocol that implements the model.

Selective Sampling With Redundant Views Selective sampling, a form of active learning, reduces  the cost of labeling training data by asking  only for the labels of the most informative unlabeled  examples. We introduce a novel approach  to selective sampling which we call co-testing. Cotesting  can be applied to problems with redundant  views (i.e., problems with multiple disjoint sets of  attributes that can be used for learning). We analyze  the most general algorithm in the co-testing  family, naive co-testing, which can be used with  virtually any type of learner. Naive co-testing  simply selects at random an example on which the  existing views disagree. We applied our algorithm  to a variety of domains, including three real-world  problems: wrapper induction, Web page classification,  and discourse trees parsing. The empirical  results show that besides reducing the number of  labeled examples, naive co-testing may also boost  the classification accuracy.

A First-Order Approach to Unsupervised Learning . This paper deals with learning first-order logic rules from data lacking an explicit classification predicate. Consequently, the learned rules are not restricted to predicate definitions as in supervised Inductive Logic Programming. First-order logic offers the ability to deal with structured, multi-relational knowledge. Possible applications include first-order knowledge discovery, induction of integrity constraints in databases, multiple predicate learning, and learning mixed theories of predicate definitions and integrity constraints. One of the contributions of our work is a heuristic measure of confirmation, trading off satisfaction and novelty of the rule. The approach has been implemented in the Tertius system. The system performs an optimal best-first search, finding the k most confirmed hypotheses. It can be tuned to many different domains by setting its parameters, and it can deal either with individual-based representations as in propositional learning or with general logi...

Domain-Specific Knowledge Acquisition For Conceptual Sentence Analysis  The availability of on-line corpora is rapidly changing the field of natural language processing (NLP) from one dominated by theoretical models of often very specific linguistic phenomena to one guided by computational models that simultaneously account for a wide variety of phenomena that occur in real-world text. Thus far, among the best-performing and most robust systems for reading and summarizing large amounts of real-world text are knowledge-based natural language systems. These systems rely heavily on domain-specific, handcrafted knowledge to handle the myriad syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic ambiguities that pervade virtually all aspects of sentence analysis.

Advanced Interaction in Context . Mobile information appliances are increasingly used in numerous  different situations and locations, setting new requirements to their interaction  methods. When the user's situation, place or activity changes, the functionality  of the device should adapt to these changes. In this work we propose a layered  real-time architecture for this kind of context-aware adaptation based on  redundant collections of low-level sensors. Two kinds of sensors are  distinguished: physical and logical sensors, which give cues from environment  parameters and host information. A prototype board that consists of eight  sensors was built for experimentation. The contexts are derived from cues using  real-time recognition software, which was constructed after experiments with  Kohonen's Self-Organizing Maps and its variants.

tieu00boosting
Boosting Image Retrieval We present an approach for image retrieval using a very large number of highly selective features and efficient online learning. Our approach is predicated on the assumption that each image is generated by a sparse set of visual "causes" and that images which are visually similar share causes. We propose a mechanism for computing a very large number of highly selective features which capture some aspects of this causal structure (in our implementation there are over 45,000 highly selective features). At query time a user selects a few example images, and a technique known as "boosting" is used to learn a classification function in this feature space. By construction, the boosting procedure learns a simple classifier which only relies on 20 of the features. As a result a very large database of images can be scanned rapidly, perhaps a million images per second. Finally we will describe a set of experiments performed using our retrieval system on a database of 3000 images. 1. Introductio...

An Efficient Boosting Algorithm for Combining Preferences We study the problem of learning to accurately rank a set of objects by combining a given collection  of ranking or preference functions. This problem of combining preferences arises in several  applications, such as that of combining the results of different search engines, or the "collaborativefiltering  " problem of ranking movies for a user based on the movie rankings provided by other  users. In this work, we begin by presenting a formal framework for this general problem. We then  describe and analyze an efficient algorithm called RankBoost for combining preferences based on  the boosting approach to machine learning. We give theoretical results describing the algorithm's  behavior both on the training data, and on new test data not seen during training. We also describe  an efficient implementation of the algorithm for a particular restricted but common case. We next  discuss two experiments we carried out to assess the performance of RankBoost. In the first experiment,  we used the algorithm to combine different web search strategies, each of which is a query  expansion for a given domain. The second experiment is a collaborative-filtering task for making  movie recommendations.

Application of Moving Objects and Spatiotemporal Reasoning In order to predict future variations of moving objects which general attributes, locations, and regions of  spatial objects are changed over time, spatiotemporal data, domain knowledge, and spatiotemporal operations  are required to process together with temporal and spatial attributes of data. However, conventional researches  on temporal and spatial reasoning cannot be applied directly to the inference using moving objects, because they  have been studied separately on temporal or spatial attribute of data. Therefore, in this paper, we not only define  spatial objects in time domain but also propose a new type of moving objects and spatiotemporal reasoning  model that has the capability of operation and inference for moving objects. The proposed model is made up  of spatiotemporal database, GIS tool, and inference engine for application of spatiotemporal reasoning using  moving objects and they execute operations and inferences for moving objects. Finally, to show the applicability  of the proposed model, a proper domain is established for the battlefield analysis system to support commander's  decision making in the army operational situation and it is experimented with this domain.

Context Filters for Document-Based Information Filtering In this paper we propose a keyPhrase-sense disambiguation methodology called "context filters" for use in keyPhrase based information filtering systems. A context filter finds whether an input keyPhrase has occurred in the required context. Context filters consider various factors of ambiguity. Some of these factors are special to information filtering and they are handled in a structured fashion. The proposed context filters are very comprehensibile. Context filters consider varieties of contexts which are not considered in existing word-sense disambiguation methods but these are all needed for information filtering. The ideas on context filters that we report in this paper form important elements of an Instructible Information Filtering Agent that we are developing. 1.

Sangam: Modeling Transformations For Integrating Now and Tomorrow Today many application engineers struggle to not only publish their relational, object or ascii file data on the Web but to also integrate information from diverse sources, often inventing and reinventing a suite of hard-wired integration tools. A model management system that supports the specification and manipulation of not only data models and schemata, but also mappings between the different models in a generic manner has the promise of solving these issues. However, support for modeling and managing such mappings as objects remains an unsolved challenge. In our work, we propose a powerful middleware tool that successfully tackles this challenge. For this, we propose a graph-theoretic framework that allows users to explicitly model mappings between different data models as well as re-structuring within one data model. Our map metamodel is based on a set of re-usable mapping constructs that can in principle be applied on any data model described in our framework. In our work, we have tested these operators for XML and relational model mappings. Using the description of maps at the model level, mappings between specific application schemas and transformations of associated application data can be automated by our framework. Our framework guarantees the correctness of the map, of the generated transformation code, of the output data model, and of the generated application schemas, based on the correctness criteria for the map metamodel. In this paper, we also introduce the model management system    that we are developing to realize our proposed map modeling theory. With  ! we show not only the feasibility of our approach but also demonstrate the re-usability and the ease of end-to-end development of modeling strategies. To further illustrate our ide...

Pruning Classifiers in a Distributed Meta-Learning System JAM is a powerful and portable agent-based distributed data mining system that employs meta-learning techniques to integrate a number of independent classifiers (concepts) derived in parallel from independent and (possibly) inherently distributed databases. Although metalearning promotes scalability and accuracy in a simple and straightforward manner, brute force meta-learning techniques can result in large, inefficient and some times inaccurate meta-classifier hierarchies. In this paper we explore several techniques for evaluating classifiers and we demonstrate that meta-learning combined with certain pruning methods can achieve similar or even better performance results in a much more cost effective manner.

Behavior Coordination Mechanisms - State-of-the-art In behavior-based robotics the control of a robot is shared between a set of purposive perception-action units, called behaviors. Based on selective sensory information, each behavior produces immediate reactions to control the robot with respect to a particular objective, i.e., a narrow aspect of the robot's overall task such as obstacle avoidance or wall following. Behaviors with di erent and possibly incommensurable objectives may produce con icting actions that are seemingly irreconcilable. Thus a major issue in the design of behavior-based control systems is the formulation of e ective mechanisms for coordination of the behaviors' activities into strategies for rational and coherent behavior. This is known as the action selection problem (also refereed to as the behavior coordination problem) and is the primary focus of this overview paper. Numerous action selection mechanisms have been proposed over the last decade and the main objective of this document istogive a qualitative overview of these approaches. 2 1

Backtracking Algorithms for Disjunctions of Temporal Constraints We extend the framework of simple temporal problems studied originally by Dechter, Meiri and Pearl to consider constraints of the form x1 \Gamma y1  r1  : : :  xn \Gamma  yn  rn , where x1 : : : xn ; y1 : : : yn are variables ranging over the real numbers, r1 : : : rn are real constants, and n  1. We have implemented four progressively more efficient algorithms for the consistency checking problem for this class of temporal constraints. We have partially ordered those algorithms according to the number of visited search nodes and the number of performed consistency checks. Finally, we have carried out a series of experimental results on the location of the hard region. The results show that hard problems occur at a critical value of the ratio of disjunctions to variables. This value is between 6 and 7. Introduction  Reasoning with temporal constraints has been a hot research topic for the last fifteen years. The importance of this problem has been demonstrated in many areas of artifici...

Detecting Intrusions Using System Calls: Alternative Data Models Intrusion detection systems rely on a wide variety of observable data to distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate activities. In this paper we study one such observable---sequences of system calls into the kernel of an operating system. Using system-call data sets generated by several different programs, each consisting both of normal and intrusive behavior, we compare the ability of different data-modeling methods to represent normal behavior accurately and to recognize intrusions. We compare the following methods: simple enumeration of observed sequences, methods based on relative frequencies of different sequences, a data mining technique, and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). All of the methods perform adequately, with HMMs giving the best overall results. We discuss the factors affecting the performance of each method, and conclude that for this particular problem, weaker methods than HMMs are likely sufficient.  1 Introduction  In 1996, Forrest and others introduced a simple in...

MOCSYN: Multiobjective Core-Based Single-Chip System Synthesis In this paper, we present a system synthesis algorithm, called MOCSYN, which partitions and schedules embedded system specifications to intellectual property cores in an integrated circuit. Given a system specification consisting of multiple periodic task graphs as well as a database of core and integrated circuit characteristics, MOCSYN synthesizes real-time heterogeneous single-chip hardware-software architectures using an adaptive multiobjective genetic algorithm that is designed to escape local minima. The use of multiobjective optimization allows a single system synthesis run to produce multiple designs which trade off different architectural features. Integrated circuit price, power consumption, and area are optimized under hard real-time constraints. MOCSYN differs from previous work by considering problems unique to single-chip systems.

Stylistic Experiments For Information Retrieval . A discussion on various experiments to utilize stylistic variation among texts for information retrieval purposes. 1. Stylistics  Texts vary in many ways. Authors make choices when they write a text: they decide how to organize the material they have planned to introduce; they make choices between synonyms and syntactic constructions; they choose an intended audience for the text. Authors will make these choices in various ways and for various reasons: based on personal preferences, on their view of the reader, and on what they know and like about other similar texts.  A style is a consistent and distinguishable tendency to make some of these linguistic choices. Style is, on a surface level, very obviously detectable as the choice between items in a vocabulary, between types of syntactical constructions, between the various ways a text can be woven from the material it is made of. It is the information carried in a text when compared to other texts, or in a sense compared to language...

Reasoning over Conceptual Schemas and Queries in Temporal Databases This paper introduces a new logical formalism,  intended for temporal conceptual modelling,  as a natural combination of the wellknown  description logic DLR and pointbased  linear temporal logic with Since and  Until. The expressive power of the resulting   DLRUS logic is illustrated by providing  a systematic formalisation of the most important  temporal entity-relationship data models  appeared in the literature. We define  a query language (where queries are nonrecursive  Datalog programs and atoms are  complex DLRUS expressions) and investigate  the problem of checking query containment  under the constraints defined by  DLRUS conceptual schemas, as well as the  problems of schema satisfiability and logical  implication. Although it is shown that reasoning  in full DLRUS is undecidable, we  identify the decidable (in a sense, maximal)  fragment DLR  US  by allowing applications  of temporal operators to formulas and entities  only (but not to relation expressions). We obtain  the following hierarchy of complexity results:  (a) reasoning in DLR US with atomic  formulas is EXPTIME-complete, (b) satisfiability  and logical implication of arbitrary  DLR US formulas is EXPSPACE-complete,  and (c) the problem of checking query containment  of non-recursive Datalog queries under   DLR US constraints is decidable in 2EXPTIME.

Indexing Moving Points We propose three indexing schemes for storing a set S of N points in the plane, each moving  along a linear trajectory, so that a query of the following form can be answered quickly: Given  a rectangle R and a real value t q , report all K points of S that lie inside R at time t q . We  first present an indexing structure that, for any given constant " ? 0, uses O(N=B) disk blocks,  where B is the block size, and answers a query in O((N=B)  1=2+"  + K=B) I/Os. It can also  report all the points of S that lie inside R during a given time interval. A point can be inserted  or deleted, or the trajectory of a point can be changed, in O(log  2  B N) I/Os. Next, we present a  general approach that improves the query time if the queries arrive in chronological order, by  allowing the index to evolve over time. We obtain a tradeoff between the query time and the  number of times the index needs to be updated as the points move. We also describe an indexing  scheme in which the number of I/Os required to answer a query depends monotonically on the  difference between t q and the current time. Finally, we develop an efficient indexing scheme to  answer approximate nearest-neighbor queries among moving points.

An Investigation of Machine Learning Based Prediction Systems Traditionally, researchers have used either o‚Ç¨-the-shelf models such as COCOMO, or developed local models using statistical techniques such as stepwise regression, to obtain software e‚Ç¨ort estimates. More recently, attention has turned to a variety of machine learning methods such as arti¬Æcial neural networks (ANNs), case-based reasoning (CBR) and rule induction (RI). This paper outlines some comparative research into the use of these three machine learning methods to build software e‚Ç¨ort prediction systems. We brie¬Øy describe each method and then apply the techniques to a dataset of 81 software projects derived from a Canadian software house in the late 1980s. We compare the prediction systems in terms of three factors: accuracy, explanatory value and con¬Ægurability. We show that ANN methods have superior accuracy and that RI methods are least accurate. However, this view is somewhat counteracted by problems with explanatory value and con¬Ægurability. For example, we found that considerable e‚Ç¨ort was required to con¬Ægure the ANN and that this compared very unfavourably with the other techniques, particularly CBR and least squares regression (LSR). We suggest that further work be carried out, both to further explore interaction between the enduser

Evolving Materialized Views in Data Warehouse A data warehouse contains multiple views accessed by queries. One of the most important decisions in designing a data warehouse is the selection of materialized views for the purpose of efficiently implementing decision making. The search space for the selection of materialized views is exponentially large, therefore, heuristics have been used to search a small fraction of the space to get a near optimal solution. In this paper, we explore the use of a genetic algorithm for the selection of materialized views based on multiple global processing plans for many queries. Our experimental studies indicate that the genetic algorithm delivers better solutions than some heuristics. 1 Introduction  A Data Warehouse (DW) is a repository of integrated information available for querying and analysis.

Using Decision Tree Confidence Factors for Multiagent Control . Although Decision Trees are widely used for classification tasks, they are typically not used for agent control. This paper presents a novel technique for agent control in a complex multiagent domain based on the confidence factors provided by the C4.5 Decision Tree algorithm. Using Robotic Soccer as an example of such a domain, this paper incorporates a previously-trained Decision Tree into a full multiagent behavior that is capable of controlling agents throughout an entire game. Along with using Decision Trees for control, this behavior also makes use of the ability to reason about action-execution time to eliminate options that would not have adequate time to be executed successfully. This multiagent behavior represents a bridge between low-level and high-level learning in the Layered Learning paradigm. The newly created behavior is tested empirically in game situations. 1 Introduction  Multiagent Systems is the subfield of AI that aims to provide both principles for construction...

In particular, we introduce an optimization  scheme which has several steps and assures a convergence to a useful solution.  During training a determination whether a Gaussian unit should be removed is applied.  This results in a final architecture with much smaller number of units. The  proposed global constrained optimization does not lead to overfitting which happens  when the RBF width becomes too small, this is achieved by a regularization mechanism.  Classification and regression results are demonstrated on various benchmark data  sets and compared with several variants of RBF networks.

Levels of Control and Closure in Complex Semiotic Systems It is natural to advance closures as "atomic" processes of universal evolution, and to analyze  this concept specifically. While real complex systems like organisms and complex mechanisms  cannot exist at either extreme of complete closure or lack of closure, nevertheless we should  consider the properties of closures in general: the introduction of boundaries; a corresponding  stability; the establishment of system autonomy and identity; and thereby the introduction of  emergent new systems of potentially new types. Our focus should move from simple physical  closure of common objects and classical self-organizing systems to semiotically closed systems  which maintain cyclic relations of perception, interpretation, decision, and action with their  environments. Thus issues arise concerning the use and interpretation of symbols, representations,  and/or internal models (whether explicit or implicit) by the system; and the syntactic,  semantic, and pragmatic relations among the sign tok...

Agents advanced features for negotiation in Electronic Commerce and Virtual Organisations formation process Electronic Commerce technology has changed the way traditional business is being done. Transactions' complexity is increased due both to the huge amount of available information and also to the environment dynamics. Moreover, Electronic Commerce has enabled the arising of new economical structures, as it is the case of Virtual Organisations.  Our research aims at providing flexible and general-purpose systems for intelligent negotiation, both for Electronic Commerce and Virtual Organisation formation.  This paper proposes an Electronic Market architecture implemented through a Multi-Agent system. This architecture includes both a specific market agent which plays the role of market coordinator, as well as agents representing the individual business partners with their own goals and strategies. We also include a sophisticated negotiation protocol through multi-criteria and distributed constraint formalisms. An online, continuous reinforcement learning algorithm has been designed to enab...

A Data Model and Algebra for Probabilistic Complex Values . We present a probabilistic data model for complex values. More precisely, we introduce  probabilistic complex value relations, which combine the concept of probabilistic relations with  the idea of complex values in a uniform framework. We elaborate a model-theoretic definition of  probabilistic combination strategies, which has a rigorous foundation on probability theory. We  then define an algebra for querying database instances, which comprises the operations of selection,  projection, renaming, join, Cartesian product, union, intersection, and difference. We prove that  our data model and algebra for probabilistic complex values generalizes the classical relational data  model and algebra. Moreover, we show that under certain assumptions, all our algebraic operations  are tractable. We finally show that most of the query equivalences of classical relational algebra carry  over to our algebra on probabilistic complex value relations. Hence, query optimization techniques  for class...

Highly-Available Firewall Service using Virtual Redirectors This paper introduces the dependable decentralised system architecture developed by the PHDS group. It describes the virtual redirector utilised by this architecture and how a decentralised network layer firewall application is implemented on it. Dependability of the design is achieved through the use of fault-tolerant protocols. The virtual redirector is implemented by a dynamic hashing algorithm, which uses load information and the fault/working status of nodes in the system. The focus of this paper is the implementation of a testbed which is used to compare the performance and availability of the decentralised firewall against a monolithic firewall with equivalent functionality.

The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine In this paper, we present Google, a prototype of a large-scale search engine which makes heavy use of the structure present in hypertext. Google is designed to crawl and index the Web efficiently and produce much more satisfying search results than existing systems. The prototype with a full text and hyperlink database of at least 24 million pages is available at http://google.stanford.edu/  To engineer a search engine is a challenging task. Search engines index tens to hundreds of millions of web pages involving a comparable number of distinct terms. They answer tens of millions of queries every day. Despite the importance of large-scale search engines on the web, very little academic research has been done on them. Furthermore, due to rapid advance in technology and web proliferation, creating a web search engine today is very different from three years ago. This paper provides an in-depth description of our large-scale web search engine -- the first such detailed public description we know of to date.  Apart from the problems of scaling traditional search techniques to data of this magnitude, there are new technical challenges involved with using the additional information present in hypertext to produce better search results. This paper addresses this question of how to build a practical large-scale system which can exploit the additional information present in hypertext. Also we look at the problem of how to effectively deal with uncontrolled hypertext collections where anyone can publish anything they want.

Quantum Treemaps and Bubblemaps for a Zoomable Image Browser This paper describes two algorithms for laying out groups of objects in a 2D space-filling manner. Quantum Treemaps are a variation on existing treemap algorithms that are designed for laying out images or other objects of indivisible (quantum) size. They build on the Ordered Treemap algorithm, but guarantees that every generated rectangle will have a width and height that are an integral multiple of an input object size. Bubblemaps also fill space with groups of quantum-sized objects, but generate nonrectangular blobs, and utilize space more efficiently.  Both algorithms have been applied to PhotoMesa, an application that supports browsing of large numbers of images. PhotoMesa uses a Zoomable User Interface with a simple interaction designed for novices and family use.

Dynamic Pipeline Scheduling for Improving Interactive Query Performance Interactive query performance is becoming an  important criterion for online systems where  delivering query results in a timely fashion  is critical. Pipelined execution is a promising  query execution style that can produce  the initial portion of the result early and in  a continuous fashion. In this paper we propose  techniques for delivering results faster in  a pipelined query plan. We distinguish between  two cases. For cases where the tuples  in the query result are of the same importance  we propose a dynamic rate-based  pipeline scheduling policy that produces more  results during the early stages of query execution.

Automatic Reclustering of Objects in Very Large Databases for High Energy Physics In the very large object database systems planned for some future particle physics experiments, typical physics analysis jobs will traverse millions of read-only objects, many more objects than fit in the database cache. Thus, a good clustering of objects on disk is highly critical to database performance. We present the implementation and performance measurements of a prototype reclustering mechanism which was developed to optimise I/O performance under the changing access patterns in a high energy physics database. Reclustering is done automatically and on-line. The methods used by our prototype differ greatly from those commonly found in proposed general-purpose reclustering systems. By exploiting some special characteristics of the access patterns of physics analysis jobs, the prototype manages to keep database I/O throughput close to the optimum throughput of raw sequential disk access.

Implementation and Performance Analysis of Incremental Equations for Nested Relations View materialization is an important way of improving the  performance of query processing. When an update occurs to  the source data from which a materialized view is derived, the  materialized view has to be updated so that it is consistent  with the source data. This update process is called view maintenance.  The incremental method of view maintenance, which  computes the new view using the old view and the update to  the source data, is widely preferred to full view recomputation  when the update is small in size. The small update size  becomes an important concept for measuring the cheap performance  of the incremental methods. In this paper, we investigate  what is the limit of the small update size, which we call  size limit for the incremental maintenance. When the size of  an update exceeds the limit, the incremental maintenance is no  longer cheaper than the view recomputation. The investigation  is based on incremental equations for operators in the nested  relational model...

A Framework for Designing and Implementing the User Interface of a Geographic Digital Library . Geographic data are useful for a large set of applications, such as urban planning and environmental control. These data are, however, very expensive to acquire and maintain. Moreover, their use is often restricted due to a lack of dissemination mechanisms. Digital libraries are a good approach for increasing data availability and therefore reducing costs, since they provide e#cient storage and access to large volumes of data. One major drawback to this approach is that it creates the necessity of providing facilities for a large and heterogeneous community of users to search and interact with these geographic libraries. We present a solution to this problem, based on a framework that allows the design and construction of customizable user interfaces for applications based on Geographic Digital Libraries (GDL). This framework relies on two main concepts: a geographic user interface architecture and a geographic digital library model.  Key words: Digital libraries -- User interfaces -...

The approach is based on a visual specification method for temporally changing spatial situations. This extends existing concepts for visual spatial query languages, which are only capable of querying static spatial situations. We outline a preliminary user interface that supports the specification on an intuitive and easily manageable level, and we describe the design of the underlying visual language. The visual notation can be used directly as a visual query interface to spatio-temporal databases, or it can provide predicate specifications that can be integrated into textual query languages leading to heterogeneous languages.

Approximate Statistical Tests for Comparing Supervised Classification Learning Algorithms This paper reviews five approximate statistical tests for determining whether one learning algorithm out-performs another on a particular learning task. These tests are compared experimentally to determine their probability of incorrectly detecting a difference when no difference exists (type I error). Two widely-used statistical tests are shown to have high probability of Type I error in certain situations and should never be used. These tests are (a) a test for the difference of two proportions and (b) a paired-differences t test based on taking several random train/test splits. A third test, a paired-differences t test based on 10-fold cross-validation, exhibits somewhat elevated probability of Type I error. A fourth test, McNemar's test, is shown to have low Type I error. The fifth test is a new test, 5x2cv, based on 5 iterations of 2-fold cross-validation. Experiments show that this test also has acceptable Type I error.

Facilitating Message Exchange though Middle Agents To utilize services provided by other agents, a requesting agent needs to locate and communicate with these service providers. Specifically, in order to interoperate with the providers, the requesting agent should know: 1) the service provider's interface; 2) the ontology that defines concepts used by the provider; and 3) the agent communication language (ACL) the agent uses so that it can parse and understand the communication. Currently deployed Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) encode the interface description and the ontology within a service provider's capability description (or advertisement) that is registered with a Middle Agent; however, this assumes a common ACL between communicating agents. We demonstrate how agents can communicate with each other using a template-based shallow parsing approach to constructing and decomposing messages, thus relaxing assumptions on the ACLs and message formats used.

Efficient Bulk Operations on Dynamic R-trees  In recent years there has been an upsurge of interest in spatial databases. A major issue is how to manipulate efficiently massive amounts of spatial data stored on disk in multidimensional spatial indexes (data structures). Construction of spatial indexes (bulk loading) has been studied intensively in the database community. The continuous arrival of massive amounts of new data makes it important to update existing indexes (bulk updating) efficiently. In this paper we present a simple, yet efficient, technique for performing bulk update and query operations on multidimensional indexes. We present our technique in terms of the so-called R-tree and its variants, as they have emerged as practically efficient indexing methods for spatial data. Our method uses ideas from the buffer tree lazy buffering technique and fully utilizes the available internal memory and the page size of the operating system. We give a theoretical analysis of our technique, showing that it is efficient both in terms of I/O communication, disk storage, and internal computation time. We also present the results of an extensive set of experiments showing that in practice our approach performs better than the previously best known bulk update methods with respect to update time, and that it produces a better quality index in terms of query performance. One important novel feature of our technique is that in most cases it allows us to perform a batch of updates and queries simultaneously. To be able to do so is essential in environments where queries have to be answered even while the index is being updated and reorganized.

Characterizing A Media-Enhanced Classroom Server Media-enhanced classrooms are changing the way we teach and learn. Servers for such applications  differ from a typical web server in the nature and geographic spread of the user community and the type  of information accessed from the server. This paper compares the workload of the Classroom 2000 server,  a media-enhanced classroom server, with that of a typical web server. We find several similarities and  differences between the two workloads. One of the most striking differences is that the inter-reference times  for files accessed more than once from the Classroom 2000 server are not independent, as opposed to those  of a web server.  We show that the user interface presented by the Classroom 2000 server affects server workload. We  find that client-side caching improves over time. Finally, in addition to accessing lecture material for their  current courses, students also access archieved material from previous quarters.  1 Introduction  Recent improvements in computational power...

Integrating Sounds and Motions in Virtual Environments Sounds are often the result of motions of virtual objects in a virtual environment. Therefore, sounds and the motions that caused them should be treated in an integrated way. When sounds and motions do not have the proper correspondence, the resultant confusion can lessen the effects of each. In this paper, we present an integrated system for modeling, synchronizing, and rendering sounds for virtual environments. The key idea of the system is the use of a functional representation of sounds, called timbre trees. This representation is used to model sounds that are parameterizable. These parameters can then be mapped to the parameters associated with the motions of objects in the environment. This mapping allows the correspondence of motions and sounds in the environment. Representing arbitrary sounds using timbre trees is a difficult process that we do not address in this paper. We describe approaches for creating some timbre trees including the use of genetic algorithms. Rendering the...

Digital Libraries: A Generic Classification and Evaluation Scheme Evaluation of digital libraries (DLs) is essential for further  development in this area. Whereas previous approaches were restricted to  certain facets of the problem, we argue that evaluation of DLs should be  based on a broad view of the subject area. For this purpose, we develop  a new description scheme using four major dimensions: data/collection,  system/technology, users, and usage. For each of these dimensions, we  describe the major attributes. Using this scheme, existing DL test beds  can be characterised. For this purpose, we have performed a survey by  means of a questionnaire, which is now continued by setting up a DL  meta-library.

A Survey of Factory Control Algorithms which Can be Implemented in a Multi-Agent Heterarchy: Dispatching, Scheduling, and Pull This paper has not seriously addressed the question of what new algorithms are inspired by the multi-agent heterarchical paradigm, except in two cases. The Market-Driven Contract Net uses a new form of forward / backward scheduling called `cost-based forward / backwards continuum scheduling' which was inspired by the common agent concept of bidding. Also, Duffie's current work on developing agent-based deterministic simulation would be a new form of deterministic simulation as it attempts to automate the human interaction normally required for successful implementation of such systems. But in general we still have an open question of what new algorithms heterarchical agent architectures imply and what would be the performance of these new algorithms. Because a multi-agent heterarchy is a distributed computing paradigm, it would be worthwhile to investigate the communications overhead of these algorithms. Such evaluations are not generally reported. Such research would assure that not only can these algorithms be implemented in a multi-agent heterarchy, but that their implementation does not require excessive communications overhead. 6.

Maximum Entropy Markov Models for Information Extraction and Segmentation Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are a powerful  probabilistic tool for modeling sequential data,  and have been applied with success to many  text-related tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging,  text segmentation and information extraction. In  these cases, the observations are usually modeled  as multinomial distributions over a discrete  vocabulary, and the HMM parameters are set  to maximize the likelihood of the observations.  This paper presents a new Markovian sequence  model, closely related to HMMs, that allows observations  to be represented as arbitrary overlapping  features (such as word, capitalization, formatting,  part-of-speech), and defines the conditional  probability of state sequences given observation  sequences. It does this by using the  maximum entropy framework to fit a set of exponential  models that represent the probability of a  state given an observation and the previous state.  We present positive experimental results on the  segmentation of FAQ's.  1. Introdu...

Shock Graphs and Shape Matching We have been developing a theory for the generic representation of 2-D shape, where structural descriptions are derived from the shocks (singularities) of a curve evolution process, acting on bounding contours. We now apply the theory to the problem of shape matching. The shocks are organized into a directed, acyclic shock graph, and complexity is managed by attending to the most significant (central) shape components first. The space of all such graphs is highly structured and can be characterized by the rules of a shock graph grammar. The grammar permits a reduction of a shock graph to a unique rooted shock tree. We introduce a novel tree matching algorithm which finds the best set of corresponding nodes between two shock trees in polynomial time. Using a diverse database of shapes, we demonstrate our system's performance under articulation, occlusion, and changes in viewpoint.

A Comparative Study of Version Management Schemes for XML Documents The problem of managing multiple versions for XML documents and semistructured data is of significant  interest in many DB applications and web-related services. Traditional document version control  schemes, such as RCS, suffer from the following two problems. At the logical level, they conceal the  structure of the documents by modeling them as sequences of text lines, and storing a document's evolution  as a line-edit script. At the physical level, they can incur in severe storage or processing costs  because of their inability to trade-off storage with computation. To solve these problems, we propose  version management strategies that preserve the structure of the original document, and apply and extend  DB techniques to minimize storage and processing costs. Therefore, we propose and compare three  schemes for XML version management, namely, the Usefulness-Based Copy Control, the Multiversion  B-Tree, and the Partially Persistent List Method. A common characteristic of these schemes is that  they cluster data using the notion of page usefulness, which by selectively copying current information  from obsolete pages provides for fast version reconstruction with minimal storage overhead. The cost  and performance of these version management schemes are evaluated and compared through extensive  analysis and experimentation.

FeedbackBypass: A New Approach to Interactive Similarity Query Processing In recent years, several methods have been  proposed for implementing interactive similarity  queries on multimedia databases. Common to all  these methods is the idea to exploit user feedback  in order to progressively adjust the query parameters  and to eventually converge to an "optimal" parameter  setting. However, all these methods also  share the drawback to "forget" user preferences  across multiple query sessions, thus requiring the  feedback loop to be restarted for every new query,  i.e. using default parameter values. Not only is  this proceeding frustrating from the user's point  of view but it also constitutes a significant waste  of system resources.  In this paper we present FeedbackBypass, a new  approach to interactive similarity query processing.  It complements the role of relevance feedback  engines by storing and maintaining the query  parameters determined with feedback loops over  time, using a wavelet-based data structure (the  Simplex Tree). For each query, a favorable set of  query parameters can be determined and used to  either "bypass" the feedback loop completely for  already-seen queries, or to start the search process  from a near-optimal configuration.  FeedbackBypass can be combined well with  all state-of-the-art relevance feedback techniques  working in high-dimensional vector spaces. Its  storage requirements scale linearly with the dimensionality  of the query space, thus making even  sophisticated query spaces amenable.

Making Context Explicit in Communicating Objects INTRODUCTION  One can speak about context only with reference to something (no definition of context out of context): the context of an object, the context of interaction, the context of a problem solving, etc. However, only the context of interaction between agents seems of interest because it is in this context that other contexts are referenced or evolve. For example, if an object, as a telephone, could provide you the context in which the called person is (free, in meeting, phone on voice recorder), you could balance your wish to establish your communication versus the availability of the called person.  Several domains have already elaborated their own working definition of context. In human-machine interaction, a context is a set of information that could be used to define and interpret a situation in which interact agents. In the context-aware applications community, the context is composed of a set of information for characterizing the situation in which interact humans, applic

Artificial Agents and Logic Programming . Artificial agents represent a new paradigm in software engineering and Artificial Intelligence. As complex software-controlled systems they are capable of flexible autonomous behavior in dynamic and unpredictable environments. Over the past few years, researchers in computer science have begun to recognise that the technology of artificial agents provides the key to solving many problems in distributed computing and intelligent control, for which traditional software engineering techniques offer no solution. The field of logic programming includes many important concepts, such as declarativity, unification, meta-logic programming, and deduction rules, from which the new technology of multiagent systems can benefit. 1 Introduction Although the idea of agent systems is intuitively appealing, and there are a number of implemented systems that claim to realize this popular idea, the basic concepts underlying these systems are often not well-understood, and no attempt is made to define t...

Fusion via a Linear Combination of Scores . We present a thorough analysis of the capabilities of the linear combination (LC) model for fusion of information retrieval systems. The LC model combines the results lists of multiple IR systems by scoring each document using a weighted sum of the scores from each of the component systems. We first present both empirical and analytical justification for the hypotheses that such a model should only be used when the systems involved have high performance, a large overlap of relevant documents, and a small overlap of nonrelevant documents. The empirical approach allows us to very accurately predict the performance of a combined system. We also derive a formula for a theoretically optimal weighting scheme for combining 2 systems. We introduce d -- the difference between the average score on relevant documents and the average score on nonrelevant documents -- as a performance measure which not only allows mathematical reasoning about system performance, but also allows the selection of w...

Incremental Reinforcement Learning for designing Multi-Agent Systems Designing individual agents so that, when put together, they reach a given global goal is not an easy task. One solution to automatically build such large Multi-Agent Systems is to use decentralized learning: each agent learns by itself its own behavior. To that purpose, Reinforcement Learning methods are very attractive as they do not require a solution of the problem to be known before hand. Nevertheless, many hard points need to be solved for such a learning process to be viable. Among others, the credit assignement problem, combinatorial explosion and local perception of the world seem the most crucial and prevent optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose a framework based on a gradual learning of harder and harder tasks until the desired global behavior is reached. The applicability of our paradigm is tested on computer experiments where many agents have to coordinate to reach a global goal. Our results show that incremental learning leads to better performances than more classical techniques. We then discuss several improvements which could lead to even better performances.

ISocRob - Intelligent Society of Robots Abstract. The SocRob project was born as a challenge for multidisciplinary research on broad and generic approaches for the design of a cooperative robot society, involving Control, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence researchers. A case study on Robotic Soccer played by a team of 3 robots has started two years ago and was first tested last year during RoboCup98. This experience has clearly revealed that the robotic soccer environment is a sufficiently rich, complex and dynamic testbed to study new methodologies both on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. Therefore, the SocRob team is currently working on the SocRob project improvements and intends to compete at the World Cup of Robotic Soccer, RoboCup99, held in Stockholm, Sweden, in the middle-size league. In this paper the basic aspects of last year implementation as well as the improvements made meanwhile are briefly recalled and presented. Naturally, a special emphasis is given here to the novel solutions proposed for this year implementation, the results obtained and the expected future developments. 1

Although numerical gures vary, overall trends cited by the sources are consistent and point to exponential growth in the past and in the coming decade. As such, it is not surprising that about 85% of Internet users surveyed claim to be using search engines and search services to nd speci c information of interest. The same surveys show, however, that users are not satis ed with the performance of the current generation of search engines; the slow speed of retrieval, communication delays, and poor quality of retrieved results (e.g., noise and broken links) are commonly cited problems.

Reflective Metalogical Frameworks In computer science we speak of implementing a logic; this is done in a programming language, such as Lisp, called here the implementation language. We also reason about the logic, as in understanding how to search for proofs; these arguments are expressed in the metalanguage and conducted in the metalogic of the object language  being implemented. We also reason about the implementation itself, say to know it is correct; this is done in a programming logic. How do all these logics relate? This paper considers that question and more. We show that by taking the view that the metalogic is primary, these other parts are related in standard ways. The metalogic should be suitably rich so that the object logic can be presented as an abstract data type, and it must be suitably computational (or constructive) so that an instance of that type is an implementation. The data type abstractly encodes all that is relevant for metareasoning, i.e., not only the term constructing functions but also the...

We will demonstrate applications of dual augmentation in supporting distributed communities through a home (the Regency) and a specific appliance (CyberFridge), both of which serve as a communications link between physical and virtual worlds. Three specific types of communication are supported: direct (supporting real-time user-to-user interaction), indirect (interaction mediated by devices such as games, a refrigerator, etc), and peripheral (supporting awareness of subtle information). Keywords: Augmented reality, augmented virtuality, home, ubiquitous computing 1 Introduction Physical barriers such as time and distance have traditionally stood in the way of successfully building communities which are not located in a single geogr...

Grouper: A Dynamic Clustering Interface to Web Search Results Users of Web search engines are often forced to sift through the long ordered list of document "snippets" returned by the engines. The IR community has explored document clustering as an alternative method of organizing retrieval results, but clustering has yet to be deployed on most major search engines. The NorthernLight search engine organizes its output into "custom folders" based on pre-computed document labels, but does not reveal how the folders are generated or how well they correspond to users' interests.  In this paper, we introduce Grouper -- an interface to the results of the HuskySearch meta-search engine, which dynamically groups the search results into clusters labeled by phrases extracted from the snippets. In addition, we report on the first empirical comparison of user Web search behavior on a standard ranked-list presentation versus a clustered presentation. By analyzing HuskySearch logs, we are able to demonstrate substantial differences in the number of documents f...

Let's Talk! Socially Intelligent Agents for Language Conversation Training Abstract ‚Äî This paper promotes socially intelligent animated agents for the pedagogical task of English conversation training for native speakers of Japanese. Since student-agent conversations are realized as role-playing interactions, strong requirements are imposed on the agents ‚Äô affective and social abilities. As a novel feature, social role awareness is introduced to animated conversational agents, that are by now strong affective reasoners, but otherwise often lack the social competence observed with humans. In particular, humans may easily adjust their behavior depending on their respective role in a social setting, whereas their synthetic pendants tend to be driven mostly by emotions and personality. Our main contribution is the incorporation of a ‚Äòsocial filter program ‚Äô to mental models of animated agents. This program may qualify an agent‚Äôs expression of its emotional state by the social context, thereby enhancing the agent‚Äôs believability as a conversational partner. Our implemented system is web-based and demonstrates socially aware animated agents in a virtual coffee shop environment. An experiment with our conversation system shows that users consider socially aware agents as more natural than agents that violate conventional practices.

Task-Oriented Dialogs with Animated Agents in Virtual Reality We are working towards animated agents that can carry on tutorial, task-oriented dialogs with human students. The agent's objective is to help students learn to perform physical, procedural tasks, such as operating and maintaining equipment. Although most research on such dialogs has focused on verbal communication, nonverbal communication can play many important roles as well. To allow a wide variety of interactions, the student and our agent cohabit a threedimensional, interactive, simulated mock-up of the student's work environment. The agent, Steve, can generate and recognize speech, demonstrate actions, use gaze and gestures, answer questions, adapt domain procedures to unexpected events, and remember past actions. This paper focuses on Steve's methods for generating multi-modal behavior, contrasting our work with prior work in task-oriented dialogs, multimodal explanation generation, and animated conversational characters.

Least-Squares Temporal Difference Learning TD() is a popular family of algorithms for approximate policy evaluation in large MDPs. TD() works by incrementally updating the value function after each observed transition. It has two major drawbacks: it makes inefficient use of data, and it requires the user to manually tune a stepsize schedule for good performance. For the case of linear value function approximations and = 0, the Least-Squares TD (LSTD) algorithm of Bradtke and Barto (Bradtke and Barto, 1996) eliminates all stepsize parameters and improves data efficiency. This paper extends Bradtke and Barto's work in three significant ways. First, it presents a simpler derivation of the LSTD algorithm. Second, it generalizes from = 0 to arbitrary values of ; at the extreme of = 1, the resulting algorithm is shown to be a practical formulation of supervised linear regression. Third, it presents a novel, intuitive interpretation of LSTD as a model-based reinforcement learning technique.

Static management of integrity in object-oriented databases: Design and implementation Abstract. In this paper, we propose an efficient technique to statically manage integrity constraints in object-oriented database programming languages. We place ourselves in the context of a simplified database programming language, close to O2, in which we assume that updates are undertaken by means of methods. An important issue when dealing with constraints is that of efficiency. A nave management of such constraints can cause a severe floundering of the overall system. Our basic assumption is that the run-time checking of constraints is too costly to be undertaken systematically. Therefore, methods that are always safe with respect to integrity constraints should be proven so at compile time. The run-time checks should only concern the remaining methods. To that purpose, we propose a new approach, based on the use of predicate transformers combined with automatic theorem proving techniques, to prove the invariance of integrity constraints under complex methods. We then describe the current implementation of our prototype, and report some experiments that have been performed with it on non trivial examples. The counterpart of the problem of program verification is that of program correction. Static analysis techniques can also be applied to solve that problem. We present a systematic approach to undertake the automatic correction of potentially unsafe methods. However, the advantages of the latter technique are not as clear as those of program verification. We will therefore discuss some arguments for and against the use of method correction. 1

Efficient and Cost-effective Techniques for Browsing and Indexing Large Video Databases We present in this paper a fully automatic content-based approach to organizing and indexing video data. Our methodology involves three steps:  ffl Step 1: We segment each video into shots using a Camera-Tracking technique. This process also extracts the feature vector for each shot, which consists of two statistical variances V ar  BA  and V ar  OA  . These values capture how much things are changing in the background and foreground areas of the video shot.  ffl Step 2: For each video, We apply a fully automatic method to build a browsing hierarchy using the shots identified in Step 1.  ffl Step 3: Using the V ar  BA  and V ar  OA  values obtained in Step 1, we build an index table to support a variance-based video similarity model. That is, video scenes/shots are retrieved based on given values of V ar  BA  and V ar  OA  .  The above three inter-related techniques offer an integrated framework for modeling, browsing, and searching large video databases. Our experimental results indic...

Dynamic Agent Population in Agent-Based Distance Vector Routing The Intelligent mobile agent paradigm can be applied to a wide variety of intrinsically parallel and distributed applications. Network routing is one such application that can be mapped to an agent-based approach. The performance of any agent-based system will depend on its agent population. Although a lot of research has been conducted on agent-based systems, little consideration has been given to the importance of agent population in dynamic networks. A large number of constituent agents can increase the resource overhead of the system, thereby impeding the overall performance of the network.

Broadcasting Consistent Data to Read-Only Transactions from Mobile Clients In this paper, we study the data inconsistency problem in data broadcast to mobile transactions. While data items in a mobile computing system are being broadcast, update transactions may install new values for the data items. If the executions of update transactions and broadcast of data items are interleaved without any control, the transactions generated by mobile clients, called mobile transactions, may observe inconsistent data values. In this paper, we propose a new protocol, called Update-First with Order (UFO), for concurrency control between read-only mobile transactions and update transactions. We show that although the protocol is simple, all the schedules are serializable when the UFO protocol is applied. Furthermore, the new protocol possesses many desirable properties for mobile computing systems such as the mobile transactions do not need to set any lock before they read a data item from the "air" and the protocol can be applied to different broadcast algorithms. Its performance has been investigated with extensive simulation experiment. The results show that the protocol can maximize the freshness of the data items provided to mobile transactions and the broadcast overhead is not heavy especially when the arrival rate of the update  transactions is not very high.

Intelligent agents in virtual enterprises Decreasing innovation cycles, changing market situations as well as growing specialisation in individual market segments demand new ways of economic thinking, increasingly forcing enterprises into cooperations, sometimes even with direct competitors. Presently discussed and designated as the corporate and cooperation model of the future is the so-called virtual enterprise. In this paper, we advocate the use of intelligent agents as a useful metaphor and as a software engineering methodology for the design and the operation of virtual enterprises. We focus on how agents can support the cooperative process of setting up virtual enterprises through the Internet by performing tasks such as presentation, information retrieval and extraction, and the participation in auctions in electronic markets. This paper does not describe completed research; it rather offers a perspective of the high potential of agent-based technology for one of tomorrow's key industrial areas by presenting the main objectives of the new research project AVE

Computing the Entropy of User Navigation in the Web Navigation through the web, colloquially known as ‚Äúsurfing‚Äù, is one of the main activities of users during web interaction. When users follow a navigation trail they often tend to get disoriented in terms of the goals of their original query and thus the discovery of typical user trails could be useful in providing navigation assistance. Herein we give a theoretical underpinning of user navigation in terms of the entropy of an underlying Markov chain modelling the web topology. We present a novel method for online incremental computation of the entropy and a large deviation result regarding the length of a trail to realise the said entropy. We provide an error analysis for our estimation of the entropy in terms of the divergence between the empirical and actual probabilities. We then indicate applications of our algorithm in the area of web data mining. Finally, we present an extension of our technique to higher-order Markov chains by a suitable reduction of a higher-order Markov chain model to a first-order one. Key words.

On Building Flexible Agents . This paper focuses on the challenge of building technical  agents that act exibly in modern computing and information environments.  It is argued that existing agent architectures tend to inherently  limit an agent's exibility because they imply a discrete social and cognitive  behavior space. A generic constraint-centered architectural framework  is proposed that aims at enabling agents to act in a continuous  behavior space and thus to achieve higher exibility.  1 Introduction  Modern computing platforms and information environments are becoming more and more distributed, large, open, dynamic, and heterogeneous. Computers are no longer stand-alone systems, but have become tightly connected both with each other and their users. The increasing technological complexity of such platforms and environments goes together with an increasing complexity of their potential applications. This development has led to a rapidly growing research and application interest in agents as a powerful ...

Learning Maps for Indoor Mobile Robot Navigation Autonomous robots must be able to learn and maintain models of their environments. Research on mobile robot navigation has produced two major paradigms for mapping indoor environments: grid-based and topological. While grid-based methods produce accurate metric maps, their complexity often prohibits efficient planning and problem solving in large-scale indoor environments. Topological maps, on the other hand, can be used much more efficiently, yet accurate and consistent topological maps are often difficult to learn and maintain in large-scale environments, particularly if momentary sensor data is highly ambiguous. This paper describes an approach that integrates both paradigms: grid-based and topological. Grid-based maps are learned using artificial neural networks and naive Bayesian integration. Topological maps are generated on top of the grid-based maps, by partitioning the latter into coherent regions. By combining both paradigms, the approach presented here gains advantages from both worlds: accuracy/consistency and efficiency. The paper gives results for autonomous exploration, mapping and operation of a mobile robot in populated multi-room environments.

Maintaining Unstructured Case Bases  With the dramatic proliferation of case based reasoning systems in commercial applications, many case bases are now becoming legacy systems. They represent a significant portion of an organization's assets, but they are large and difficult to maintain. One of the contributing factors is that these case bases are often large and yet unstructured; they are represented in natural language text. Adding to the complexity is the fact that the case bases are often authored and updated by different people from a variety ofknowledge sources, making it highly likely for a case base to contain redundant and inconsistent knowledge. In this paper, we present methods and a system for maintaining large and unstructured case bases. We focus on two difficult problems in case-base maintenance: redundancy and inconsistency detection. These two problems are particularly pervasive when one deals with an unstructured case base. We will discuss both algorithms and a system for solving these problems. As the ability tocontain the knowledge acquisition problem is of paramount importance, our methods allow one to express relevant domain expertise for detecting both redundancy and inconsistency naturally and effortlessly. Empirical evaluations of the system prove the effectiveness of the methods in several large domains.

Maintaining Transitive Closure of Graphs in SQL It is common knowledge that relational calculus and even SQL are not expressive enough to express recursive queries such as the transitive closure. In a real database system, one can overcome this problem by storing a graph together with its transitive closure and maintaining the latter whenever updates to the former occur. This leads to the concept of an incremental evaluation system, or IES. Much is already known about the theory of IES but very little has been translated into practice. The purpose of this paper is to ll in this gap by providing a gentle introduction to and an overview of some recent theoretical results on IES. The introduction is through the translation into SQL of three interesting positive maintenance results that have practical importance { the maintenance of the transitive closure of acyclic graphs, of undirected graphs, and of arbitrary directed graphs. Interestingly, these examples also allow ustoshow the relationship between power and cost in the incremental maintenance of database queries. 1

We will describe the design philosophy behind the filter flow nature of Kaleidoquery and present each of the language's constructs, giving examples and relating them to OQL. The Kaleidoquery language is described independent of any implementation details, but a brief description of a 3D interface currently under construction for Kaleidoquery is presented. The queries in this implementation of the language are translated into OQL and then passed to the object database O 2 for evaluation.

A Description Logic with Transitive and Inverse Roles and Role Hierarchies transitive roles play an important r√¥le in the adequate representation of aggregated objects: they allow these objects to be described by referring to their parts without specifying a level of decomposition. In [Horrocks & Gough, 1997], the Description Logic (DL) ALCH R + is presented, which extends ALC with transitive roles and a role hierarchy. It is argued in [Sattler, 1998] that ALCH R + is well-suited to the representation of aggregated objects in applications that require various part-whole relations to be distinguished, some of which are transitive. For example, a medical knowledge base could contain the following entries defining two different parts of the brain, namely the gyrus and the cerebellum. In contrast to a gyrus, a cerebellum is an integral organ and, furthermore, a functional component of the brain. Hence the role is component (which is a non-transitive sub-role of is part) is used to describe the relation between the brain and the cerebellum: is component ‚äë is part gyrus:= (‚àÄconsists.brain mass)  ‚äì (‚àÉis part.brain) cerebellum:= organ ‚äì (‚àÉis component.brain) However, ALCH R + does not allow the simultaneous description of parts by means of the whole to which they belong and of wholes by means of their constituent parts: one or other is possible, but not both. To overcome this limitation, we present the DL ALCHI R + which extends ALCH R + with inverse (converse) roles, allowing, for example, the use of has part as well as is part. 1 Using ALCHIR +, we can define a tumorous brain as: tumorous brain:= brain ‚äì (tumorous ‚äî (‚àÉhas part.tumorous)) Part of this work was carried out while being a guest at IRST,

Mobile Agents in Distributed Information Retrieval A mobile agent is an executing program that can migrate during execution from machine to machine in a heterogeneous network. On each machine, the agent interacts with stationary service agents and other resources to accomplish its task. Mobile agents are particularly attractive in distributed informationretrieval applications. By moving to the location of an information resource, the agent can search the resource locally, eliminating the transfer of intermediate results across the network and reducing end-toend latency. In this chapter, we rst discuss the strengths of mobile agents, and argue that although none of these strengths are unique to mobile agents, no competing technique shares all of them. Next, after surveying several representative mobile-agent systems, we examine one speci c information-retrieval application, searching distributed collections of technical reports, and consider how mobile agents can be used to implement this application e ciently and easily. Then we spend the bulk of the chapter describing two planning services that allow mobile agents to deal with dynamic network environments and information resources: (1) planning algorithms that let an agent choose the best migration path through the network, given its current task and the current network conditions, and (2) planning algorithms that tell an agent howto observe achanging set of documents in a way that detects changes as soon as possible while minimizing overhead. Finally, we consider the types of errors that can occur when information from multiple sources is merged and ltered, and argue that the structure of a mobile-agent application determines the extent to which these errors a ect the nal result. 1

A critical problem with information agents, particularly  those gathering and integrating information  from Web sources is a high query response time. This  is because the data needed to answer user queries is  present across several differentWeb sources (and in  several pages within a source) and retrieving,extracting  and integrating the data is time consuming. Weaddress  this problem by materializing useful classes of information  and defining them as auxiliary data sources  for the information agent. The key challenge here is to  identify the contentandschema of the classes of information  that would be useful to materialize. We present  an algorithm that identifies such classes by analyzing  patterns in user queries. We describe an implementation  of our approach and experiments in progress. We  also discuss other important problems that we will address  in optimizing information agents.

Quality-Based Learning We introduce a methodology for automating the maintenance of domain-specific taxonomies based on natural language text understanding. A given ontology is incrementally updated as new concepts are acquired from real-world texts. The acquisition process is centered around the linguistic and conceptual "quality" of various forms of evidence underlying the generation and refinement of concept hypotheses. On the basis of the quality of evidence, concept hypotheses are ranked according to credibility and the most credible ones are selected for assimilation into the domain knowledge base.

Probe, Count, and Classify: Categorizing Hidden-Web Databases The contents of many valuable web-accessible databases are only accessible through search interfaces and are hence invisible to traditional web "crawlers." Recent studies have estimated the size of this "hidden web" to be 500 billion pages, while the size of the "crawlable" web is only an estimated two billion pages. Recently, commercial web sites have started to manually organize web-accessible databases into Yahoo!-like hierarchical classification schemes. In this paper, we introduce a method for automating this classification process by using a small number of query probes. To classify a database, our algorithm does not retrieve or inspect any documents or pages from the database, but rather just exploits the number of matches that each query probe generates at the database in question. We have conducted an extensive experimental evaluation of our technique over collections of real documents, including over one hundred web-accessible databases. Our experiments show that our system has low overhead and achieves high classification accuracy across a variety of databases.  1.

Running Across the Reality Gap: Octopod Locomotion Evolved in a Minimal Simulation . This paper describes experiments in which neural network control architectures were evolved in minimal simulation for an octopod robot. The robot is around 30cm long and has 4 infra red sensors that point ahead and to the side, various bumpers and whiskers, and ten ambient light sensors positioned strategically around the body. Each of the robot's eight legs is controlled by two servo motors, one for movement in the horizontal plane, and one for movement in the vertical plane, which means that the robots motors have a total of sixteen degrees of freedom. The aim of the experiments was to evolve neural network control architectures that would allow the robot to wander around its environment avoiding objects using its infra-red sensors and backing away from objects that it hits with its bumpers. This is a hard behaviour to evolve when one considers that in order to achieve any sort of coherent movement the controller has to control not just one or two motors in a coordinated fashion bu...

It uses  a visual hand tracker to extract 3D hand configuration data from a visual motion  sequence, and a classifier that recognises the changes of these 3D kinematic data as  a sign. This paper presents the HMU classifier that uses an adaptive fuzzy inference  engine for sign recognition. Fuzzy set theory allows the system to express the sign  knowledge in natural and imprecise descriptions. The HMU classifier has an  adaptive engine that trains the system to be adaptive to the errors caused by the  tracker or the motion variations exhibited amongst the signers.

Will We Have a Wet Summer? Soft Computing Models for Long-term Rainfall Forecasting Long-term rainfall prediction is very important to countries thriving on agro-based economy. In general, climate and rainfall are highly non-linear phenomena in nature giving rise to what is known as "butterfly effect". The parameters that are required to predict the rainfall are enormously complex and subtle so that uncertainty in a prediction using all these parameters is enormous even for a short period. Soft computing is an innovative approach to construct computationally intelligent systems that are supposed to possess humanlike expertise within a specific domain, adapt themselves and learn to do better in changing environments, and explain how they make decisions. Unlike conventional artificial intelligence techniques the guiding principle of soft computing is to exploit tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, robustness, partial truth to achieve tractability, and better rapport with reality (Zadeh 1998). In this paper, we analysed 87 years of rainfall data in Kerala state, the southern part of Indian Peninsula situated at latitude-longitude pairs (8029 ' N - 76057 ' E). We attempted to train 5 soft computing based prediction models with 40 years of rainfall data. For performance evaluation, network predicted outputs were compared with the actual rainfall data. Simulation results reveal that soft computing techniques are promising and efficient.

Classification on Pairwise Proximity Data We investigate the problem of learning a classification task on data represented in terms of their pairwise proximities. This representation does not refer to an explicit feature representation of the data items and is thus more general than the standard approach of using Euclidean feature vectors, from which pairwise proximities can always be calculated. Our first approach is based on a combined linear embedding and classification procedure resulting in an extension of the Optimal Hyperplane algorithm to pseudo-Euclidean data. As an alternative we present another approach based on a linear threshold model in the proximity values themselves, which is optimized using Structural Risk Minimization. We show that prior knowledge about the problem can be incorporated by the choice of distance measures and examine different metrics w.r.t. their generalization. Finally, the algorithms are successfully applied to protein structure data and to data from the cat's cerebral cortex. They show bette...

In the literature, Ravi Kumar et al.

The trawling approach extracts a small group of pages that form a CBG, which is a signature of a potential community.

Variorum: A Multimedia-Based Program Documentation System Conventional software documentation systems are mostly based on textutal descriptions that explain or annotate the program's source code. Typically they also support interactive browsing of high-level control flows, and name-based searching of program primitives such as variable declarations and function definitions. Because these systems rely solely on texts, it is difficult for program authors to describe overall algorithm structures and detailed implementation considerations of the programs in an interactive and flexible fashion.

Rotating Virtual Objects with Real Handles Times for virtual object rotations reported in the literature are of the order of ten seconds or more and this is far longer than it takes to manually orient a "real" object, such as a cup. This is a report of a series of experiments designed to investigate the reasons for this difference and to help design interfaces for object manipulation. The results suggest that two major factors are important. Having the hand physically in the same location as the virtual object being manipulated is one. The other is based on whether the object is being rotated to a new, randomly determined orientation, or is always rotated to the same position. Making the object held in the hand have the same physical shape as the object being visually manipulated was not found to be a significant factor.

Exploring auction-based leveled-commitment contracting - Part III: Vickrey-type auctioning A key problem addressed in the area of multiagent systems is the automated  assignment of multiple tasks to executing agents. The automation  of multiagent task assignment requires that the individual agents (i) use  a common protocol that prescribes how they have to interact in order to  come to an agreement and (ii) fix their final agreement in a contract that  specifies the commitments resulting from the assignment on which they  agreed. This report describes a novel approach to automated task assignment  in multiagent systems that is based on an auction-based protocol  and on leveled commitment contracting. This approach is applicable in a  broad range of realistic scenarios in which knowledge-intensive negotiation  among agents is not feasible and in which future environmental changes  may require agents to breach their contracts.  1 Introduction  The area of multiagent systems (e.g., [5, 8, 16]), which is concerned with systems composed of technical entities called agents that in...

Architecture of a Metasearch Engine that Supports User Information Needs When a query is submitted to a metasearch engine, decisions are made with respect to the underlying search engines to be used, what modifications will be made to the query, and how to score the results. These decisions are typically made by considering only the user's keyword query, neglecting the larger information need. Users with specific needs, such as "research papers" or "homepages," are not able to express these needs in a way that affects the decisions made by the metasearch engine. In this paper, we describe a metasearch engine architecture that considers the user's information need for each decision. Users with different needs, but the same keyword query, may search different sub-search engines, have different modifications made to their query, and have results ordered differently. Our architecture combines several powerful approaches together in a single general purpose metasearch engine.  1 Introduction  Current metasearch engines make several decisions on behalf of the use...

Prediction with Local Patterns using Cross-Entropy Sets of local patterns in the forms of rules and co-occurrence counts are produced by many data mining methods such as association rule algorithms. While such patterns can yield useful insights it is not obvious how to synthesize local sparse information into a coherent global predictive model. We study the use of a cross-entropy approach to combining local patterns. Each local pattern is viewed as a constraint on an appropriate high-order joint distribution of interest. Typically, a set of patterns returned by a data mining algorithm under-constrains the high-order model. The cross-entropy criterion is used to select a specific distribution in this constrained family relative to a prior. We review the iterative-scaling algorithm which is an iterative technique for finding a joint distribution given constraints. We then illustrate the application of this method to two specific problems. The first problem is combining information about frequent itemsets. We show that the cross-entropy a...

A Cognitive Bias Approach to Feature Selection and Weighting for Case-Based Learners . Research in psychology, psycholinguistics, and cognitive science has discovered and examined numerous psychological constraints on human information processing. Short term memory limitations, a focus of attention bias, and a preference for the use of temporally recent information are three examples. This paper shows that psychological constraints such as these can be used e#ectively as domain-independent sources of bias to guide feature set selection and weighting for case-based learning algorithms.  We first show that cognitive biases can be automatically and explicitly encoded into the baseline instance representation: each bias modifies the representation by changing features, deleting features, or modifying feature weights. Next, we investigate the related problems of cognitive bias selection and cognitive bias interaction for the feature weighting approach. In particular, we compare two cross-validation algorithms for bias selection that make di#erent assumptions about the indep...

Selection of Behavioral Parameters: Integration of Discontinuous Switching via Case-Based Reasoning with Continuous Adaptation via Learning Momentum This paper studies the effects of the integration of two learning algorithms, Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Learning Momentum (LM), for the selection of behavioral parameters in real-time for robotic navigational tasks. Use of CBR methodology in the selection of behavioral parameters has already shown significant improvement in robot performance [3, 6, 7, 14] as measured by mission completion time and success rate. It has also made unnecessary the manual configuration of behavioral parameters from a user. However, the choice of the library of CBR cases does affect the robot's performance, and choosing the right library sometimes is a difficult task especially when working with a real robot. In contrast, Learning Momentum does not depend on any prior information such as cases and searches for the &quot;right &quot; parameters in real-time. This results in high mission success rates and requires no manual configuration of parameters, but it shows no improvement in mission completion time [2]. This work combines the two approaches so that CBR discontinuously switches behavioral parameters based on given cases whereas LM uses these parameters as a starting point for the real-time search for the &quot;right&quot; parameters. The integrated system was extensively evaluated on both simulated and physical robots. The tests showed that on simulated robots the integrated system performed as well as the CBR only system and outperformed the LM only system, whereas on real robots it significantly outperformed both CBR only and LM only systems.

Query Unnesting in Object-Oriented Databases There is already a sizable body of proposals on OODB query optimization. One of the most challenging problems in this area is query unnesting, where the embedded query can take any form, including aggregation and universal quantification. Although there is already a number of proposed techniques for query unnesting, most of these techniques are applicable to only few cases. We believe that the lack of a general and simple solution to the query unnesting problem is due to the lack of a uniform algebra that treats all operations (including aggregation and quantification) in the same way. This paper presents a new query unnesting algorithm that generalizes many unnesting techniques proposed recently in the literature. Our system is capable of removing  any form of query nesting using a very simple and efficient algorithm. The simplicity of the system is due to the use of the monoid comprehension calculus as an intermediate form for OODB queries. The monoid comprehension calculus treats op...

Abstractions and Infrastructures for the Design and Development of Mobile Agent Organizations Internet applications can take advantage of a paradigm based on  autonomous and mobile agents. However, suitable abstractions  and infrastructures are required for the effective engineering of  such applications. In this paper, we argue that a conceptual  framework for context-dependent coordination, supported by an  infrastructure based on programmable media, can promote a  modular and easy to manage approach to the design and  development of mobile agent applications in terms of  computational organizations. The MARS coordination  infrastructure is presented as an implementation of a  coordination infrastructure promoting context-dependent  coordination. A case study in the area of workflow management is  introduced to clarify the concepts presented.

On Using Regression for Range Data Fusion In the paper, we consider an occupancy-based approach for range data fusion, as it is used in mobile robotics. We identify two major problems of this approach. The first problem deals with the combination rule which in many cases assumes the independence of range data, contrary to the usual situation. The second problem concerns the redundancy of stored and processed data, which results from using the grid representation of the occupancy function and which is the main obstacle to building 3D occupancy world models. We propose a solution to these problems by proposing a new range data fusion technique based on regression. This technique uses the evidence theory in assigning occupancy values, which we argue is advantageous for fusion, and builds the occupancy function by fitting the sample data provided by a sensor with a piecewise linear function. Having developed a general framework for our approach, we apply it to building 3D world models from visual range data, where 3D world models ...

VOODOO: A Visual Object-Oriented Database Language for ODMG OQL This paper presents a simple and effective visual language to express ODMG OQL queries. The  language is expressive enough to allow most types of query nesting, aggregation, universal and existential  quantifications, group-by, and sorting, and at the same time is uniform and very simple to learn and  use. Our visual language is strongly typed in the sense that queries constructed in our system are always  type-correct. In addition, there is sufficient type information displayed by the system that guides every  stage of the query construction. The main difference between our language and other related visual query  languages is that we use only one generic visual construct, called a template, instead of inventing a new  one for each OQL syntactic feature.  1 Introduction  Query and data visualizations are key components of many commercial relational database systems, such as Microsoft Access and Paradox.

A Parameter-Less Genetic Algorithm From the user's point of view, setting the parameters of a genetic algorithm (GA) is far from a trivial task. Moreover, the user is typically not interested in population sizes, crossover probabilities, selection rates, and other GA technicalities. He is just interested in solving a problem, and what he would really like to do, is to hand-in the problem to a blackbox algorithm, and simply press a start button. This paper explores the development of a GA that fulfills this requirement. It has no parameters whatsoever. The development of the algorithm takes into account several aspects of the theory of GAs, including previous research works on population sizing, the schema theorem, building block mixing, and genetic drift.

Document Categorization and Query Generation on the World Wide Web Using WebACE We present WebACE, an agent for exploring and categorizing documents on the World Wide Web based on a user profile. The heart of the agent is an unsupervised categorization of a set of documents, combined with a process for generating new queries that is used to search for new related documents and for filtering the resulting documents to extract the ones most closely related to the starting set. The document categories are not given a priori. We present the overall architecture and describe two novel algorithms which provide significant improvement over Hierarchical Agglomeration Clustering and AutoClass algorithms and form the basis for the query generation and search component of the agent. We report on the results of our experiments comparing these new algorithms with more traditional clustering algorithms and we show that our algorithms are fast and scalable. y  Authors are listed alphabetically.  1 Introduction  The World Wide Web is a vast resource of information and services t...

Improving Performance Of Case-Based Classification Using Context-Based Relevance Classification involves associating instances with particular classes by maximizing intra-class similarities and minimizing inter-class similarities. Thus, the way similarity among instances is measured is crucial for the success of the system. In case-based reasoning, it is assumed that similar problems have similar solutions. The case-based approach to classification is founded on retrieving cases from the case base that are similar to a given problem, and associating the problem with the class containing the most similar cases. Similarity-based retrieval tools can advantageously be used in building flexible retrieval and classification systems. Case-based classification uses previously classified instances to label unknown instances with proper classes. Classification accuracy is affected by the retrieval process -- the more relevant the instances used for classification, the greater the accuracy. The paper presents a novel approach to case-based classification. The algorithm is bas...

Query Formulation from High-level Concepts for Relational Databases A new query formulation system based on a semantic graph model is presented. The graph provides a semantic model for the data in the database with userdefined relationships. The query formulator allows users to specify their requests and constraints in highlevel concepts. The query candidates are formulated based on the user input by a graph search algorithm and ranked according to a probabilistic information measure. English-like query descriptions can also be provided for users to resolve ambiguity when multiple queries are formulated from a user input. For complex queries, we introduce an incremental approach, which assists users to achieve a complex query goal by formulating a series of simple queries. A prototype system with a multimodal interface using the high-level query formulation techniques has been implemented on top of a cooperative database system (CoBase) at UCLA.  1 Introduction  Many database applications require users to formulate ad-hoc queries instead of invocation ...

A Hybrid Model For Sharing Information Between Fuzzy, Uncertain And Default Reasoning Models In Multi-Agent Systems This paper develops a hybrid model which provides a unified framework for the fol-  lowing four kinds of reasoning: 1) Zadeh's fuzzy approximate reasoning; 2) truthqualification  uncertain reasoning with respect to fuzzy propositions; 3) fuzzy default  reasoning (proposed, in this paper, as an extension of Reiter's default reasoning); and 4)  truth-qualification uncertain default reasoning associated with fuzzy statements (developed  in this paper to enrich fuzzy default reasoning with uncertain information). Our  hybrid model has the following characteristics: 1) basic uncertainty is estimated in terms  of words or phrases in natural language and basic propositions are fuzzy; 2) uncertainty,  linguistically expressed, can be handled in default reasoning; and 3) the four kinds of rea-  soning models mentioned above and their combination models will be the special cases of  our hybrid model. Moreover, our model allows the reasoning to be performed in the case  in which the information is fuzzy, uncertain and partial. More importantly, the problems  of sharing the information among heterogeneous fuzzy, uncertain and default reasoning  models can be solved efficiently by using our model. Given this, our framework can be  used as a basis for information sharing and exchange in knowledge-based multi-agent  systems for practical applications such as automated group negotiations.

An Evolutionary Approach to Materialized Views Selection in a Data Warehouse Environment A data warehouse contains multiple views accessed by queries. One of the most important decisions in designing a data warehouse is selecting views to materialize for the purpose of eciently supporting decision making. The search space for possible materialized views is exponentially large. Therefore heuristics have been used to search for a near optimal solution. In this paper, we explore the use of an evolutionary algorithm for materialized view selection based on multiple global processing plans for queries. We apply a hybrid evolutionary algorithm to solve three related problems. The rst is to optimize queries. The second is to choose the best global processing plan from multiple global processing plans. The third is to select materialized views from a given global processing plan. Our experiment shows that the hybrid evolutionary algorithm delivers better performance than either the evolutionary algorithm or heuristics used alone in terms of the minimal query and maintenance cost and the evaluation cost to obtain the minimal cost.

In-Context Information Management through Adaptive Collaboration of Intelligent Agents Although the number and availability of electronic information sources are increasing, current information technology requires manual manipulation and userspecification of all details. Once accessed, information must be filtered in the context of the user's task. Current systems lack the ability to get contextual information or use it to automate filtering. At Carnegie Mellon University, we have been engaged in the RETSINA project, which aims to develop a reusable multiagent software infrastructure that allows heterogeneous agents on the Internet, possibly developed by different designers, to collaborate with each other to manage information in the context of user-specified tasks. In this chapter, we will provide a brief overview of the whole system and then focus on its capability for in-context information management.

Places to stay on the move: Software architectures for mobile user interfaces Architectural design has an important effect on usability, most notably on temporal properties. This paper investigates software architecture options for mobile user-interfaces, in particular those for collaborative systems. One of the new features of mobile systems as compared with fixed networks is the connection point to the physical network, the point of presence (PoP), which forms an additional location for code and data. This allows architectures that bring computation closer to the users hence reducing feedback and feedthrough delays. A consequence of using PoPs is that code and data have to be mobile within the network leading to potential security problems.

A Framework for Automated Construction and Transformation of Case-Based Reasoning Systems Case Based Reasoning systems have gained immense popularity over the recent  years as problem-solving tools. Most case based reasoning systems, however, are developed  essentially from scratch using proprietary systems and applications on a limited  number of platforms.

Agent Factory: Generative Migration of Mobile Agents in Heterogeneous Environments In most of today's agent systems migration of agents requires homogeneity in the programming language and/or agent platform in which an agent has been designed. In this paper an approach is presented with which heterogeneity is possible: agents can migrate between non-identical platforms, and need not be written in the same language. Instead of migrating the "code" (including data and state) of an agent, a blueprint of an agent's functionality is transferred. An agent factory generates new code on the basis of this blueprint. This approach of generative mobility not only has implications for interoperability but also for security, as discussed in this paper.

View-based Query Processing and Constraint Satisfaction View-based query processing requires to answer a query posed to a database only on the basis of the information on a set of views, which are again queries over the same database. This problem is relevant in many aspects of database management, and has been addressed by means of two basic approaches, namely, query rewriting and query answering. In the former approach, one tries to compute a rewriting of the query in terms of the views, whereas in the latter, one aims at directly answering the query based on the view extensions. We study view-based query processing for the case of regular-path queries, which are the basic querying mechanisms for the emergent field of semistructured data. Based on recent results, we first show that a rewriting is in general a co-NP function wrt to the size of view extensions. Hence, the problem arises of characterizing which instances of the problem admit a rewriting that is PTIME. A second contribution of the work is to establish a tight connection between view-based query answering and constraint-satisfaction problems, which allows us to show that the above characterization is going to be difficult. As a third contribution of our work, we present two methods for computing PTIME rewritings of specific forms. The first method, which is based on the established connection with constraint-satisfaction problems, gives us rewritings expressed in Datalog with a fixed number of variables. The second method, based on automata-theoretic techniques, gives us rewritings that are formulated as unions of conjunctive regular-path queries with a fixed number of variables.

Practical Reasoning with Procedural Knowledge (A Logic of BDI Agents with Know-How) . In this paper, we present a new logic for specifying the behaviour of  multi-agent systems. In this logic, agents are viewed as BDI systems, in that their  state is characterised in terms of beliefs, desires, and intentions: the semantics  of the BDI component of the logic are based on the well-known system of Rao  and Georgeff. In addition, agents have available to them a library of plans, representing  their `know-how': procedural knowledge about how to achieve their intentions.  These plans are, in effect, programs, that specify how a group of agents  can work in parallel to achieve certain ends. The logic provides a rich set of constructs  for describing the structure and execution of plans. Some properties of the  logic are investigated, (in particular, those relating to plans), and some comments  on future work are presented.  1 Introduction  There is currently much international interest in computer systems that go under the banner of intelligent agents [16].

On the Integration of IR and Databases : Integration of information retrieval (IR) in database management  systems (DBMSs) has proven di#cult. Previous attempts to integration su#ered  from inherent performance problems, or lacked desirable separation between  logical and physical data models. To overcome these problems, we discuss a  database approach based on structural object-orientation. We implement IR  techniques using extensions in an object algebra called MOA. MOA has been  implemented on top of the database backend Monet, a state-of-the-art highperformance  database kernel with a binary relational interface. Our prototype  implementation of the inference network retrieval model using MOA and Monet  demonstrates the feasibility of this approach.

A Comparison of Mobile Agent and Client-Server Paradigms for Information Retrieval Tasks in Virtual Enterprises In next-generation enterprises it will become increasingly important to retrieve information efficiently and rapidly from widely dispersed sites in a virtual enterprise, and the number of users who wish to do using wireless and portable devices will increase significantly. This paper considers the use of mobile agent technology rather than traditional clientserver computing for information retrieval by mobile and wireless users in a virtual enterprise. We argue that to be successful mobile agent platforms must coexist with, and be presented to the applications programmer sideby -side with, traditional client-server middleware like CORBA and DCOM, and we sketch a middleware architecture for doing so. We then develop an analytical model that examines the claimed performance benefits of mobile agents over client-server computing for a mobile information retrieval scenario. Our evaluation of the model shows that mobile agents are not always better than client-server calls in terms of average response times; they are only beneficial if the space overhead of the mobile agent code is not too large or if the wireless link connecting the mobile user to the fixed servers of the virtual enterprise is error-prone.

Cryptographic Protocols for Secure Second-Price Auctions In recent years auctions have become more and more important in the  field of multiagent systems as useful mechanisms for resource allocation, task  assignment and last but not least electronic commerce. In many cases the Vickrey  (second-price sealed-bid) auction is used as a protocol that prescribes how the  individual agents have to interact in order to come to an agreement. The main  reasons for choosing the Vickrey auction are the existence of a dominant strategy  equilibrium, the low bandwidth and time consumption due to just one round  of bidding and the (theoretical) privacy of bids. This paper specifies properties  that are needed to ensure the accurate and secret execution of Vickrey auctions  and provides a classification of different forms of collusion. We approach the two  major security concerns of the Vickrey auction: the vulnerability to a lying auctioneer  and the reluctance of bidders to reveal their private valuations. We then  propose a novel technique that allows to securely perform second-price auctions.  This is achieved using the announcement of encrypted binary bidding lists on a  blackboard. Top-down, bottom-up and binary search techniques are used to interactively  find the second highest bid step by step without revealing unnecessary  information.  1

Version Space Algebra and its Application to Programming by Demonstration Machine learning research has been very  successful at producing powerful, broadlyapplicable  classification learners. However,  many practical learning problems do not fit  the classification framework well, and as a  result the initial phase of suitably formulating  the problem and incorporating the relevant  domain knowledge can be very di#cult  and typically consumes the majority of the  project time. Here we propose a framework  to systematize and speed this process, based  on the notion of version space algebra.

Concurrency in Prolog Using Threads and a Shared Database Concurrency in Logic Programming has received much attention in the past. One problem with many proposals, when applied to Prolog, is that they involve large modifications to the standard implementations, and/or the communication and synchronization facilities provided do not fit as naturally within the language model as we feel is possible. In this paper we propose a new mechanism for implementing synchronization and communication for concurrency, based on atomic accesses to designated facts in the (shared) database. We argue that this model is comparatively easy to implement and harmonizes better than previous proposals within the Prolog control model and standard set of built-ins. We show how in the proposed model it is easy to express classical concurrency algorithms and to subsume other mechanisms such as Linda, variable-based communication, or classical parallelism-oriented primitives. We also report on an implementation of the model and provide performance and resource consumption data. 1

Handling Temporal Grouping and Pattern-Matching Queries in a Temporal Object Model This paper presents a language for expressing temporal pattern-matching queries, and a set of temporal grouping operators for structuring histories following calendar-based criteria. Pattern-matching queries are shown to be useful for reasoning about successive events in time while temporal grouping may be either used to aggregate data along the time dimension or to display histories. The combination of these capabilities allows to express complex queries involving succession in time and calendar-based conditions simultaneously. These operators are embedded into the TEMPOS temporal data model and their use is illustrated through examples taken from a geographical application. The proposal has been validated by a prototype on top of the O 2 DBMS.  Keywords: temporal databases, temporal object model, temporal query language, pattern-matching queries, temporal grouping, calendar, granularity, O 2 .  1 Introduction  In most modern DBMS, time is one of the primitive datatypes provided for d...

Clustering Categorical Data: An Approach Based on Dynamical Systems We describe a novel approach for clustering collections of sets, and its application to the analysis and mining of categorical data. By "categorical data," we mean tables with fields that cannot be naturally ordered by a metric --- e.g., the names of producers of automobiles, or the names of products offered by a manufacturer. Our approach is based on an iterative method for assigning and propagating weights on the categorical values in a table; this facilitates a type of similarity measure arising from the cooccurrence of values in the dataset. Our techniques can be studied analytically in terms of certain types of non-linear dynamical systems. We discuss experiments on a variety of tables of synthetic and real data; we find that our iterative methods converge quickly to prominently correlated values of various categorical fields. 1 Introduction  Much of the data in databases is categorical: fields in tables whose attributes cannot naturally be ordered as numerical values can.

Effective Resource Discovery on the World Wide Web this paper, we present USEwebNET, a resource discovery tool built on top of traditional search engines. USEwebNET registers each user's interests and repeatedly queries several search engines for URLs matching a user's registered interests. USEwebNET keeps track of which URLs have been visited by each user. Thus, when a user invokes USEwebNET, (s)he is presented only with new or "unvisited" URLs. We view USEwebNET as a value-added service on top of existing search engines and information providers, which helps users effectively find "what's new" in the rapidly evolving web of our world.

Accelerated Focused Crawling through Online Relevance Feedback The organization of HTML into a tag tree structure, which is rendered by browsers as roughly rectangular regions with embedded text and HREF links, greatly helps surfers locate and click on links that best satisfy their information need. Can an automatic program emulate this human behavior and thereby learn to predict the relevance of an unseen HREF target page w.r.t. an information need, based on information limited to the HREF source page? Such a capability would be of great interest in focused crawling and resource discovery, because it can fine-tune the priority of unvisited URLs in the crawl frontier, and reduce the number of irrelevant pages which are fetched and discarded.

X-Klaim and Klava: Programming Mobile Code Highly distributed networks have now become a common infrastructure for a new kind of wide-area distributed applications whose key design principle is network awareness, namely the ability to deal with dynamic changes of the network environment. Network-aware computing has called for new programming languages that exploit the mobility paradigm as the basic interaction mechanism. In this paper we present the Klaim (Kernel Language for Agent Interaction and Mobility) framework for programming mobile code applications, namely the X-Klaim programming language and the Java-based run-time system Klava. In particular, we illustrate how Klava handles mobile code. Finally, an example is shown that is implemented using this framework.

Support Vector Machines for Face Authentication The paper studies Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in the context of face  authentication. Our study supports the hypothesis that the SVM approach  is able to extract the relevant discriminatory information from the training  data. We believe this is the main reason for its superior performance over  benchmark methods. When the representation space already captures and  emphasises the discriminatory information content as in the case of Fisherfaces,  SVMs loose their superiority. SVMs can also cope with illumination  changes, provided these are adequately represented in the training data.  However, on data which has been sanitised by feature extraction (Fisherfaces)  and/or normalisation, SVMs can get over-trained, resulting in the loss of the  ability to generalise. SVMs involve many parameters and can employ different  kernels. This makes the optimisation space rather extensive, without the  guarantee that it has been fully explored to find the best solution.  1 Introduction  Verificat...

An Architecture for Building Multi-Device Thin-Client Web User Interfaces We describe a new approach to providing adaptable thin client  interfaces for web-based information systems. Developers specify web-based  interfaces using a high-level mark-up language based on the logical structure of  the user interface. At run-time this single interface description is used to  automatically provide an interface for multiple web devices e.g. desk-top  HTML and mobile WML-based systems, as well as highlight, hide or disable  interface elements depending on the current user and user task. Our approach  allows developers to much more easily construct and maintain adaptable webbased  user interfaces than other current approaches.

Genetic Programming and Multi-Agent Layered Learning by Reinforcements We present an adaptation of the standard genetic program (GP) to hierarchically decomposable, multi-agent learning problems. To break down a problem that requires cooperation of multiple agents, we use the team objective function to derive a simpler, intermediate objective function for pairs of cooperating agents. We apply GP to optimize first for the intermediate, then for the team objective function, using the final population from the earlier GP as the initial seed population for the next. This layered learning approach facilitates the discovery of primitive behaviors that can be reused and adapted towards complex objectives based on a shared team goal.

Managing Periodically Updated Data in Relational Databases: A Stochastic Modeling Approach Recent trends in information management involve the periodic transcription  of data onto secondary devices in a networked environment, and the proper  scheduling of these transcriptions is critical for efficient data management. To assist  in the scheduling process, we are interested in modeling data obsolescence, that is,  the reduction of consistency over time between a relation and its replica. The modeling  is based on techniques from the field of stochastic processes, and provides several  stochastic models for content evolution in the base relations of a database, taking  referential integrity constraints into account. These models are general enough to  accommodate most of the common scenarios in databases, including batch insertions  and life spans both with and without memory. As an initial "proof of concept" of the  applicability of our approach, we validate the insertion portion of our model framework  via experiments with real data feeds. We also discuss a set of transcription  protocols which make use of the proposed stochastic model.

On the Integration of Technologies for Capturing and Navigating Knowledge With Ontology-Driven Services Nowadays, many distinct communities are researching on technologies for knowledge capturing, modelling, and navigation. Moreover,  advances in Internet technology makes it possible to perform most of these tasks on heterogeneous and distributed environments such as the Web. These advances though, have raise the need for knowledge services to accommodate the ever increasing number of Web users. To provide such a service one needs to combine key technologies for different aspects of knowledge management: capturing, modelling, navigating. This should be tightly integrated with the intended service. We describe such an integration effort in this paper. Our domain is a Web-based news repository and we aimed to provide personalised ontology-driven services on the top of it. We used knowledge capturing technologies to populate the underlying ontologies, knowledge modelling techniques to provide reasoning capabilities for the ontology-driven service, and navigating technologies to overlay Web-pages with the ontology-driven service.

An Event-Driven Sensor Architecture for Low Power Wearables In this paper we define a software architecture for low power wearable computers. The architecture is event driven, and is designed so that application programs have access to sensor data without the need for polling. The software architecture is designed to allow for an underlying hardware architecture that can achieve maximal power efficiency by switching off parts of the hardware that are known not to be required.  INTRODUCTION  Wearable Computing places particular demands on software. It is characterised by having to accommodate a potentially large number of input devices which are simultaneously providing contextual data; a need to minimise processor activity to reduce battery consumption [1]; and the requirement for simplicity to aid debugging applications which may be used in adverse conditions.  As a result of our experiences with software which had none of the above features, we have developed an eventdriven sensor architecture and used it successfully for several applications...

Overview of Datalog Extensions with Tuples and Sets Datalog (with negation) is the most powerful query language for relational database with a well-defined declarative semantics based on the work in logic programming. However, Datalog only allows inexpressive flat structures and cannot directly support complex values such as nested tuples and sets common in novel database applications. For these reasons, Datalog has been extended in the past several years to incorporate tuple and set constructors. In this paper, we examine four different Datalog extensions: LDL, COL, Hilog and Relationlog. 1 Introduction  Databases and logic programming are two independently developed areas in computer science. Database technology has evolved in order to effectively and efficiently organize, manage and maintain large volumes of ever increasingly complex data reliably in various memory devices.

Composition of Services with Mobile Code Mobile code is slowly gaining acceptance but it is still not clear where it is really useful. If not used judiciously it may incur greater complexity of programming and degradation of performances. The goal of this paper is to show that mobile code is particularly well suited as a glue for the composition of immobile services, where flexibility and extensibility are necessary. To support our claim we describe two services and one application that have been programmed with mobile code in the context of active networking. We study the impact on the flexibility, complexity and performances of the resulting systems. We observe positive effects on flexibility and complexity and acceptable performance penalties.  1. Introduction  The main idea of active networking is to make mobile code a core functionality of the network. Traditionally network elements like routers only transport packets and do not try to decode or modify the enclosed payload. In an Active Network, the nodes can perform cus...

This paper rst briey presents the Cooperative Multi-robot Observation of Multiple Moving Targets (CMOMMT) application as a rich domain for studying the issues of multi-robot learning of new behaviors. We discuss the results of our handgenerated algorithm for CMOMMT, and then describe our research in generating multi-robot learning techniques for the CMOMMT application, comparing the results to the hand-generated solutions. Our results show that, while the learning approach performs better than random, naive approaches, much room still remains to match the results obtained from the hand-generated approach. The ultimate goal of this research is to develop techniques for multi-robot learning and adaptation that will generalize to cooperative robot applications in many domains, thus facilitating the practical use of multi-robot teams in a wid...

On Wrapping Query Languages and Efficient XML Integration Modern applications/portals, e-commerce, digital libraries, etc.) require integrated access to various information sources (from traditional RDBMS to semistructured Web repositories), fast deployment and low maintenance cost in a rapidly evolving environment. Because of its flexibility, there is an increasing interest in using XML as a middleware model for such applications. XML enables fast wrapping and declarative integration. However, query processing in XML-based integration systems is still penalized by the lack of an algebra with adequate optimization properties and the difficulty to understand source query capabilities. In this paper, we propose an algebraic approach to support efficient query evaluation in XML integration systems. We define a general purpose algebra suitable for semistructured or XML query languages. We showhow this algebra can be used, with appropriate type information, to also wrap more structured query languages such as OQL or SQL. Finally,we develop new optimizat...

XML Conceptual Modeling using UML . The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is increasingly finding  acceptance as a standard for storing and exchanging structured and  semi-structured information. With its expressive power, XML enables a  great variety of applications relying on such structures - notably product  catalogs, digital libraries, and electronic data interchange (EDI). As  the data schema, an XML Document Type Definition (DTD) is a means  by which documents and objects can be structured. Currently, there is  no suitable way to model DTDs conceptually. Our approach is to model  DTDs and thus classes of documents on the basis of UML (Unified Modeling  Language). We consider UML to be the connecting link between  software engineering and document design, i.e., it is possible to design  object-oriented software together with the necessary XML structures. For  this reason, we describe how to transform the static part of UML, i.e.  class diagrams, into XML DTDs. The major challenge for the transformation  is to defi...

Initialization of Iterative Refinement Clustering Algorithms Iterative refinement clustering algorithms (e.g. K-Means, EM) converge to one of numerous local minima. It is known that they are especially sensitive to initial conditions. We present a procedure for computing a refined starting condition from a given initial one that is based on an efficient technique for estimating the modes of a distribution. The refined initial  starting condition leads to convergence to "better" local minima. The procedure is applicable to a wide class of clustering algorithms for both discrete and continuous data. We demonstrate the application of this method to the Expectation Maximization (EM) clustering algorithm and show that refined initial points indeed lead to improved solutions. Refinement run time is considerably lower than the time required to cluster the full database. The method is scalable and can be coupled with a scalable clustering algorithm to address the large-scale clustering in data mining.  1 Background  Clustering has been formulated in var...

Reliable Communication for Highly Mobile Agents . The provision of a reliable communication infrastructure for mobile agents is still an open research issue. The challenge to reliability we address in this work does not come from the possibility of faults, but rather from the mere presence of mobility, which complicates the problem of ensuring the delivery of information even in a fault-free network. For instance, the asynchronous nature of message passing and agent migration may cause situations where messages forever chase a mobile agent that moves frequently from one host to another. Current solutions rely on conventional technologies that either do not provide a solution for the aforementioned problem, because they were not designed with mobility in mind, or enforce continuous connectivity with the message source, which in many cases defeats the very purpose of using mobile agents.  In this paper, we propose an algorithm that guarantees delivery to highly mobile agents using a technique similar to a distributed snapshot. A numbe...

Recommending Web Documents Based on User Preferences Making recommendations requires treating users as individuals. In this paper, we describe a metasearch engine available at NEC Research Institute that allows individual search strategies to be used. Each search strategy consists of a different set of sources, different query modification rules and a personalized ordering policy. We combine these three features with a dynamic interface that allows users to see the "current best" recommendations displayed at all times, and allows results to be displayed immediately upon retrieval. We present several examples where a single query produces different results, ordered based on different factors, accomplished without the use of training, or a local database.

Towards a Distributed, Environment-Centered Agent Framework . This paper will discuss the internal architecture for an agent framework  called DECAF (Distributed Environment Centered Agent Framework).

Corpus-Based Stemming using Co-occurrence of Word Variants Stemming is used in many information retrieval (IR) systems to reduce variant word forms  to common roots. It is one of the simplest applications of natural language processing to IR,  and one of the most effective in terms of user acceptance and consistent, though small, retrieval  improvements. Current stemming techniques do not, however, reflect the language use in specific  corpora and this can lead to occasional serious retrieval failures.

Probabilistic Models for Unified Collaborative and Content-Based Recommendation in Sparse-Data Environments Recommender systems leverage product and  community information to target products to  consumers. Researchers have developed collaborative  recommenders, content-based recommenders,  and a few hybrid systems. We propose  a unified probabilistic framework for merging  collaborative and content-based recommendations.  We extend Hofmann's (1999) aspect  model to incorporate three-way co-occurrence  data among users, items, and item content. The  relative influence of collaboration data versus  content data is not imposed as an exogenous parameter,  but rather emerges naturally from the  given data sources. However, global probabilistic  models coupled with standard EM learning algorithms  tend to drastically overfit in the sparsedata  situations typical of recommendation applications.  We show that secondary content information  can often be used to overcome sparsity.  Experiments on data from the ResearchIndex  library of Computer Science publications  show that appropriate mixture models incorporating  secondary data produce significantly better  quality recommenders than k-nearest neighbors  (k-NN). Global probabilistic models also allow  more general inferences than local methods like  k-NN.

Representing and Querying Changes in Semistructured Data Semistructured data may be irregular and incomplete and does not necessarily conform to a fixed schema. As with structured data, it is often desirable to maintain a history of changes to data, and to query over both the data and the changes. Representing and querying changes in semistructured data is more difficult than in structured data due to the irregularity and lack of schema. We present a model for representing changes in semistructured data and a language for querying over these changes. We discuss implementation strategies for our model and query language. We also describe the design and implementation of a "query subscription service" that permits standing queries over changes in semistructured information sources. 1 Introduction  Semistructured data is data that has some structure, but it may be irregular and incomplete and does not necessarily conform to a fixed schema (e.g, HTML documents).

Navigational Plans For Data Integration We consider the problem of building data integration systems when the data sources are webs of data, rather than sets of relations. Previous approaches to modeling data sources are inappropriate in this context because they do not capture the relationships between linked data and the need to navigate through paths in the data source in order to obtain the data. We describe a language for modeling data sources in this new context. We show that our language has the required expressive power, and that minor extensions to it would make query answering intractable. We provide a sound and complete algorithm for reformulating a user query into a query over the data sources, and we show how to create query execution plans that both query and navigate the data sources.

Heterogeneity in the Coevolved Behaviors of Mobile Robots: The Emergence of Specialists Many mobile robot tasks can be most efficiently  solved when a group of robots is utilized. The type  of organization, and the level of coordination and  communication within a team of robots affects the  type of tasks that can be solved. This paper examines  the tradeoff of homogeneity versus heterogeneity  in the control systems by allowing a team of  robots to coevolve their high-level controllers given  different levels of difficulty of the task. Our hypothesis  is that simply increasing the difficulty of a task  is not enough to induce a team of robots to create  specialists. The key factor is not difficulty per se,  but the number of skill sets necessary to successfully  solve the task. As the number of skills needed  increases, the more beneficial and necessary heterogeneity  becomes. We demonstrate this in the  task domain of herding, where one or more robots  must herd another robot into a confined space.  1

Coordinating Mutually Exclusive Resources using GPGP Hospital Patient Scheduling is an inherently distributed problem because of the way real hospitals are organized. As medical procedures have become more complex, and their associated tests and treatments have become interrelated, the current ad hoc patient scheduling solutions have been observed to break down. We propose a multi-agent solution using the Generalized Partial Global Planning (GPGP) approach that preserves the existing human organization and authority structures, while providing better system-level performance (increased hospital unit throughput and decreased patient stay time). To do this, we extend GPGP with a new coordination mechanism to handle mutually exclusive resource relationships. Like the other GPGP mechanisms, the new mechanism can be applied to any problem with the appropriate resource relationship. We evaluate this new mechanism in the context of the hospital patient scheduling problem, and examine the effect of increasing interrelations between tasks performed...

Learning Motor Skills By Imitation: A Biologically Inspired Robotic Model. This article presents a biologically inspired model for motor skills imitation. The model is composed of modules whose functinalities are inspired by corresponding brain regions responsible for the control of movement in primates. These modules are high-level abstractions of the spinal cord, the primary and premotor cortexes (M1 and PM), the cerebellum, and the temporal cortex. Each module is modeled at a connectionist level. Neurons in PM respond both to visual observation of movements and to corresponding motor commands produced by the cerebellum. As such, they give an abstract representation of mirror neurons. Learning of new combinations of movements is done in PM and in the cerebellum. Premotor cortexes and cerebellum are modeled by the DRAMA neural architecture which allows learning of times series and of spatio-temporal invariance in multimodal inputs. The model is implemented in a mechanical simulation of two humanoid avatars, the imitator and the imitatee. Three types of sequences learning are presented: (1) learning of repetitive patterns of arm and leg movements; (2) learning of oscillatory movements of shoulders and elbows, using video data of a human demonstration; 3) learning of precise movements of the extremities for grasp and reach

Decomposition of Database Classes under Path Functional Dependencies and Onto Constraints Based on F-logic, we specify an advanced data model with object-oriented and  logic-oriented features that substantially extend the relational approach. For this  model we exhibit and study the counterpart to the well-known decomposition of  a relation scheme according to a nontrivial nonkey functional dependency. For  decomposing a class of a database schema the transformation of pivoting is used.  Pivoting separates apart some attributes of the class into a newly generated class.  This new class is declared to be a subclass of the result class of the so-called pivot  attribute. Moreover the pivot attribute provides the link between the original class  and the new subclass.

A Reference Model for Situation-Aware Assistance As computers are becoming more and more ubiquitous, moving from the desktop into the infrastructure of our everyday life, they begin to influence the way we interact with this environment -- the (physical) entities that we operate upon in order to achieve our daily goals. The most important aspect of future human-computer interaction therefore is the way, computers support us in efficiently managing our personal environment. Conventionally, human-computer interaction looks at a process, where only two partners are involved: the human and the computer. However, looking at the computer as a mediator between the user and his environment, we have to acknowledge a more complex communication process. This paper proposes a reference model that identifies the fundamental components which are involved in human-computer-environment interaction.

Cyberoos2000: Experiments with Emergent Tactical Behaviour this paper is that, rather than defining situated or tactical reasoning ad hoc, it is desirable to categorise agents according to their functionality and reactions to the environment, and identify corresponding classes of action theories and agent architectures. Then, the reasoning exhibited by agents of a certain type (and validated by particular action theories) can be declared to be situated, tactical, strategic, social and so on. In other words, the principal target is a systematic description of increasing levels of agent reasoning abilities. The results reported in [8, 9, 10] demonstrated that this is achievable at the situated level. Preliminary results on the systematic models for basic tactical behaviour were obtained as well [11]. This work intends to use this framework in experimenting with emergent tactical teamwork; and thus build up empirical results and intuition necessary to advance the systematic methodology towards collaborative goal-oriented agents.

Using Decision Trees to Improve Case-Based Learning This paper shows that decision trees can be used to improve the performance of casebased learning (CBL) systems. We introduce a performance task for machine learning systems called semi-flexible prediction that lies between the classification task performed by decision tree algorithms and the flexible prediction task performed by conceptual clustering systems. In semi-flexible prediction, learning should improve prediction of a specific set of features known a priori rather than a single known feature (as in classification) or an arbitrary set of features (as in conceptual clustering). We describe one such task from natural language processing and present experiments that compare solutions to the problem using decision trees, CBL, and a hybrid approach that combines the two. In the hybrid approach, decision trees are used to specify the features to be included in k-nearest neighbor case retrieval.

A formal framework is introduced for the analysis and specification of models for trust evolution and trust update.

The agent might for example trust that the statements made by another agent are true. The agent might trust the commitment of another agent with respect to a certain (joint) goal. The agent might trust that another agent is capable of performing certain tasks. The agent might trust itself to be able to perform some tasks. The agent might trust that the current state of affairs will lead to a state of affairs that is agreeable to its own intentions, goals, commitments, or desires.

Comparing Statistical and Content-Based Techniques for Answer Validation on the Web Answer Validation is an emerging topic in Question Answering, where open  domain systems are often required to rank huge amounts of candidate answers. We  present a novel approach to answer validation based on the intuition that the amount  of implicit knowledge which connects an answer to a question can be estimated by  exploiting the redundancy of Web information. Two techniques are considered in this  paper: a statistical approach, which uses the Web to obtain a large amount of pages,  and a content-based approach, which analyses text snippets retrieved by the search  engine. Both the approaches do not require to download the documents. Experiments  carried out on the TREC-2001 judged-answer collection show that a combination of  the two approaches achieves a high level of performance (i.e. about 88% success rate).

Personalized Web-Document Filtering Using Reinforcement Learning Abstract- Document filtering is increasingly deployed in Web environments to reduce information overload of users. We formulate online information filtering as a reinforcement learning problem, i.e. TD(0). The goal is to learn user profiles that best represent his information needs and thus maximize the expected value of user relevance feedback. A method is then presented that acquires reinforcement signals automatically by estimating user‚Äôs implicit feedback from direct observations of browsing behaviors. This ‚Äúlearning by observation ‚Äù approach is contrasted with conventional relevance feedback methods which require explicit user feedbacks. Field tests have been performed which involved 10 users reading a total of 18,750 HTML documents during 45 days. Compared to the existing document filtering techniques, the proposed learning method showed superior performance in information quality and adaptation speed to user preferences in online filtering. 1

Market Clearability Market mechanisms play a central role in AI as a  coordination tool in multiagent systems and as an  application area for algorithm design. Mechanisms  where buyers are directly cleared with sellers, and  thus do not require an external liquidity provider,  are highly desirable for electronic marketplaces for  several reasons. In this paper we study the inherent  complexity of, and design algorithms for, clearing  auctions and reverse auctions with multiple indistinguishable  units for sale. We consider settings  where bidders express their preferences via  price-quantity curves, and settings where the bids  are price-quantity pairs. We show that markets  with piecewise linear supply/demand curves and  non-discriminatory pricing can always be cleared  in polynomial time. Surprisingly, if discriminatory  pricing is used to clear the market, the problem  becomes NP-Complete (even for step function  curves). If the price-quantity curves are all  linear, then, in most variants, the problem admits  a poly-time solution even for discriminatory pricing.  When bidders express their preferences with  price-quantity pairs, the problem is NP-Complete,  but solvable in pseudo-polynomial time. With free  disposal, the problem admits a poly-time approximation  scheme, but no such approximation scheme  is possible without free disposal.

Image Recognition and Neuronal Networks: Intelligent Systems for the Improvement of Imaging Information this paper we have concentrated on describing issues related to the development and use of artificial neural network-based intelligent systems for medical image interpretation. Research in intelligent systems to-date remains centred on technological issues and is mostly application driven. However, previous research and experience suggests that the successful implementation of computerised systems (e.g., [34] [35]), and decision support systems in particular (e.g., [36]), in the area of healthcare relies on the successful integration of the technology with the organisational and social context within which it is applied. Therefore, the successful implementation of intelligent medical image interpretation systems 9 should not only rely on their technical feasibility and effectiveness but also on organisational and social aspects that may rise from their applications, as clinical information is acquired, processed, used and exchanged between professionals. All these issues are critical in healthcare applications because they ultimately reflect on the quality of care provided.

Improving Multi-class Text Classification with Naive Bayes The Problem: There are billions of text documents available in electronic form. More and more are becoming available every day. The Web itself contains over a billion documents. Millions of people send e-mail every day. Academic publications and journals are becoming available inelectronicform. Thesecollections and many others represent a massive amount of information that is easily accessible. However, seeking value in this huge collection requires organization. Many web sites offer a hierarchically-organized view of the Web. E-mail clients offer a systems for filtering e-mail. Numerous academic communities have a Web site that allows searching on papers and shows an organization of papers. However, organizing documents by hand or creating rules for filtering is painstaking and labor-intensive. This can be greatly aided by automated classifier systems. The accuracy of such systems determines their usefulness. We propose to use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in conjunction with Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) to improve the state-of-the-art in text classification. Motivation & Previous Work: In 1998, Joachims published results on a set of binary text classification experiments using the SVM [4]. The SVM yielded lower error than many other classification techniques. Yang followed later with experiments of her own on the same data set [5]. She used improved versions of Naive Bayes (NB) and kNN but still found that the SVM performed at least as well as all other classifiers she tried. She also found that the linear SVM performed as well as polynomial and RBF versions. Both papers used the SVM for binary text classification,

An Autonomous Spacecraft Agent Prototype . This paper describes the New Millennium Remote Agent (NMRA) architecture for autonomous spacecraft control systems. The architecture supports challenging requirements of the autonomous spacecraft domain not usually addressed in mobile robot architectures, including highly reliable autonomous operations over extended time periods in the presence of tight resource constraints, hard deadlines, limited observability, and concurrent activity. A hybrid architecture, NMRA integrates traditional real-time monitoring and control with heterogeneous components for constraint-based planning and scheduling, robust multi-threaded execution, and model-based diagnosis and reconfiguration. Novel features of this integrated architecture include support for robust closed-loop generation and execution of concurrent temporal plans and a hybrid procedural/deductive executive. We implemented a prototype autonomous spacecraft agent within the architecture and successfully demonstrated the prototype in the c...

The Conceptual Basis for Mediation Services Mediator modules comprise a layer of intelligent middleware services in information systems, linking data resources and application programs. Earlier programs that led to the concept of mediation were either constructed to support specific applications or provided extended services from databases. Intelligent mediators are being built now by careful domain knowledge acquisition and hand crafting the required code. In this paper we present the conceptual underpinning for automating the mediation process. Automation does not extend to fully automatic code generation, since additional knowledge is necessary to provide added value. The generation concept is based on the extraction of a hierarchical domain model out of the general network representing the available resources. Associated with the method are domain ontologies. Ontologies list the terms used by the models, and document their relationships. These terms provide the semantic foundation needed to perform the generation. This paper...

Mixed-Initiative Interaction spect of effective multiagent collaboration to solve problems or perform tasks. In our minimal human-computer configuration, such tasks could include systems designed to interact with a user to design a kitchen, find the best airfare, coordinate an emergency relief mission, or teach the user how to use new equipment. Mixed-initiative  refers to a flexible interaction strategy, where each agent can contribute to the task what it does best. Furthermore, in the most general cases, the agents' roles are not determined in advance, but opportunistically negotiated between them as the problem is being solved. At any one time, one agent might have the initiative---controlling the interaction---while the other works to assist it, contributing to the interaction as required. At other times, the roles are reversed, and at other times again the agents might be working independently, assisting each other only when specifically asked. The agents dynamically adapt their interaction st

Extracting Structures of HTML Documents Using a High-Level Stack Machine Information on the Web, which are conglomeration of heterogeneous data such as texts, images and audio clips, are often accessed through documents written according to the HTML specification [7]. According to the HTML specification, HTML documents are semistructured in nature. We propose a high-level stack machine (HSM) which accesses an HTML document through its URL and constructs a semistructured data graph (SDG) of the document. The SDG of an HTML document H precisely captures the structure of the semistructured data embedded in H based on the dependency relationship [11] among the data objects in H . HSM is configurable to accommodate a user's interest with respect to the HTML elements in H to be considered during the construction process of the SDG of H .  1 Introduction  During the early days of the World-Wide Web (WWW or Web), users heavily relied on the mouse-button-click navigation method through hyperlinks provided by Web browsers to retrieve information of interest and soon ...

A Comparison of Prediction Accuracy, Complexity, and Training Time of Thirty-three Old and New Classification Algorithms Twenty-two decision tree, nine statistical, and two neural network algorithms are compared on thirty-two datasets in terms of classification accuracy, training time, and (in the case of trees) number of leaves. Classification accuracy is measured by mean error rate and mean rank of error rate. Both criteria place a statistical, spline-based, algorithm called POLYCLASS at the top, although it is not statistically significantly different from twenty other algorithms. Another statistical algorithm, logistic regression, is second and third with respect to the two accuracy criteria. The most accurate decision tree algorithm is QUEST with linear splits, which ranks fourth and fifth, respectively. Although spline-based statistical algorithms tend to have good accuracy, they also require relatively long training times. POLYCLASS, for example, is third last in terms of median training time. It often requires hours of training compared to seconds for other algorithms. The QUEST and logistic re...

Recognizing User's Context from Wearable Sensors: Baseline System INTRODUCTION We describe a baseline system for training and classifying natural situations. It is a baseline system because it will provide the reference implementation of the context classifier against which we can compare more sophisticated machine learning techniques. It should be understood that this system is a precursor to a system for understanding all types of observable context not just location. We are less interested in obtaining high precision and recall rates than we are in obtaining appropriate model structures for doing higher order tasks like clustering and prediction on a user's life activities. II. BACKGROUND There has been some excellent work on recognizing various kinds of user situations via wearable sensors.

Using Events for the Scalable Federation of Heterogeneous Components The thesis of this paper is that, using our eventbased development principles, components that were not designed to interoperate, can be made to work together quickly and easily. The only requirement is that each component must be made event-based by adding an interface for registering interest in events and an interface for injecting actions. A component notifies an event to a distributed client if the parameters of an event, internal to the component, match the parameters of a particular registration. Heterogeneous components can be federated using event-based rules; rules can respond to events from any component by injecting actions into any other component. We show that the event paradigm is scalable by illustrating how event-based components can be located worldwide, using a federation of event brokers. Additionally, we illustrate with 3 event-based systems we have developed: a component-based multimedia system, a multi-user virtual worlds system and an augmented reality system for mobile users. Finally, we show how the event paradigm is also scalable enough to allow event federation of entire systems, not just single components. We illustrate by showing how we have federated the operation of the 3 featured eventbased systems. This enables, for example, real-world mobile users to appear as avatars in the appropriate locations in the VR world, and for these avatars to move in response to actual user movements.

Conditional random  fields offer several advantages over hidden  Markov models and stochastic grammars  for such tasks, including the ability to relax  strong independence assumptions made in those  models. Conditional random fields also avoid  a fundamental limitation of maximum entropy  Markov models (MEMMs) and other discriminative  Markov models based on directed graphical  models, which can be biased towards states  with few successor states. We present iterative  parameter estimation algorithms for conditional  random fields and compare the performance of  the resulting models to HMMs and MEMMs on  synthetic data.  1.

Thus plausible behaviors can be produced rather easily. However,  for real world applications they must satisfy some requirements  concerning verification, validation and reproducibility. Using a standard  framework for designing a multi-agent model one can gain further advantages  like fast learnability, wide understandability and possible transfer.

An Evaluation of Statistical Approaches to Text Categorization Abstract. This paper focuses on a comparative evaluation of a wide-range of text categorization methods, including previously published results on the Reuters corpus and new results of additional experiments. A controlled study using three classifiers, kNN, LLSF and WORD, was conducted to examine the impact of configuration variations in five versions of Reuters on the observed performance of classifiers. Analysis and empirical evidence suggest that the evaluation results on some versions of Reuters were significantly affected by the inclusion of a large portion of unlabelled documents, mading those results difficult to interpret and leading to considerable confusions in the literature. Using the results evaluated on the other versions of Reuters which exclude the unlabelled documents, the performance of twelve methods are compared directly or indirectly. For indirect compararions, kNN, LLSF and WORD were used as baselines, since they were evaluated on all versions of Reuters that exclude the unlabelled documents. As a global observation, kNN, LLSF and a neural network method had the best performance; except for a Naive Bayes approach, the other learning algorithms also performed relatively well.

Simulated Annealing Algorithms For Continuous Global Optimization INTRODUCTION  In this paper we consider Simulated Annealing algorithms (SA in what follows) applied to continuous global optimization problems, i.e. problems with the following form  f  = min  x2X  f(x); (1.1) where X ` !  n  is a continuous domain, often assumed to be compact, which, combined with the continuity or lower semicontinuity of f , guarantees the existence of the minimum value f  . SA algorithms are based on an analogy with a physical phenomenon: while at high temperatures the molecules in a liquid move freely, if the temperature is slowly decreased the thermal mobility of the molecules is lost and they form a pure crystal which also corresponds to a state of minimum energy. If the temperature is decreased too quickly (the so called quenching) a liquid metal rather ends up in a polycrystalline or amorphous state with

Alarms: An implementation of motivated agency . Autonomous agents in the real world must be capable of asynchronous goal generation. However, one consequence of this ability is that the agent may generate a substantial number of goals, but only a small number of these will be relevant at any one time. Therefore, there is a need for tractable mechanisms to manage a changing and potentially large number of goals. This paper presents both a framework for the design of agents that have the capability to generate and manage their own top level goals, "motivated agency", and an implementation of part of this agent architecture, "alarms". The alarm-processing machinery serves to focus the attention of an agent on a limited number of the most salient goals regardless of the number of possible goals that the agent can pursue or their distribution in time. In this way, a resource-bounded autonomous agent can employ modern planning methods to greater effect. 1 Introduction  If an autonomous agent is required to interact with an environment t...

Forms/3: A First-Order Visual Language to Explore the Boundaries of the Spreadsheet Paradigm Although detractors of functional programming sometimes claim that functional programming is too difficult or counterintuitive for most programmers to understand and use, evidence to the contrary can be found by looking at the popularity of spreadsheets. The spreadsheet paradigm, a first-order subset of the functional programming paradigm, has found wide acceptance among both programmers and end users. Still, there are many limitations with most spreadsheet systems.  In this paper, we discuss language features that eliminate several of these limitations without deviating from the first-order, declarative evaluation model. The language used to illustrate these features is a research language called Forms/3. Using Forms/3, we show that procedural abstraction, data abstraction, and graphics output can be supported in the spreadsheet paradigm. We show that, with the addition of a simple model of time, animated output and GUI I/O also become viable. To demonstrate generality, we also presen...

Is Paper Safer? The Role of Paper Flight Strips in Air Traffic Control Air traffic control is a complex, safety-critical activity, with well-established and successful work practices. Yet many attempts to automate the existing system have failed because controllers remain attached to a key work artifact: the paper flight strip. This article describes a four-month intensive study of a team of Paris en route controllers in order to understand their use of paper flight strips. The article also describes a comparison study of eight different control rooms in France and the Netherlands. Our observations have convinced us that we do not know enough to simply get rid of paper strips, nor can we easily replace the physical interaction between controllers and paper strips.  These observations highlight the benefits of strips, including qualities difficult to quantify and replicate in new computer systems. Current thinking offers two basic alternatives: maintaining the existing strips without computer support and bearing the financial cost of limiting the air traff...

A Probabilistic Formulation for Hausdorff Matching Matching images based on a Hausdorff measure has become popular for computer vision applications. However, no probabilistic model has been used in these applications. This limits the formal treatment of several issues, such as feature uncertainties and prior knowledge. In this paper, we develop a probabilistic formulation of image matching in terms of maximum likelihood estimation that generalizes a version of Hausdorff matching. This formulation yields several benefits with respect to previous Hausdorff matching formulations. In addition, we show that the optimal model position in a discretized pose space can be located efficiently in this formation and we apply these techniques to a mobile robot self-localization problem. 1 Introduction  The use of variants of the Hausdorff distance has recently become popular for image matching applications (see, for example, [6, 9, 11, 16, 18, 19]). While these methods have been largely successful, they have lacked a probabilistic formulation of th...

Learning Similarity for Texture Image Retrieval A novel algorithm is proposed to learn pattern similarities for texture image retrieval. Similar patterns in different texture classes  are grouped into a cluster in the feature space. Each cluster is isolated from others by an enclosed boundary, which is represented by several  support vectors and their weights obtained from a statistical learning  algorithm called support vector machine (SVM). The signed distance of  a pattern to the boundary is used to measure its similarity. Furthermore,  the patterns of different classes within each cluster are separated  by several sub-boundaries, which are also learned by the SVMs. The  signed distances of the similar patterns to a particular sub-boundary  associated with the query image are used for ranking these patterns.  Experimental results on the Brodatz texture database indicate that the  new method performs significantly better than the traditional Euclidean  distance based approach.

On the Expressivity and Complexity of Temporal Conceptual Modelling The contribution of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it introduces T DLR, a novel temporal  logic for temporal conceptual modelling, motivated as the obvious generalisation of the successful DLR  Description Logic. Tight decidability and complexity results are proved for T DLR and the monodic  fragment of it (T DLR ). Moreover, the decidability of conjunctive query containment under T DLR  constraints is proved. On the other hand, the paper provides a formal semantic characterisation of all  the important temporal conceptual modelling constructs (for valid time representation) as found in the  literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic formalisation of the constructs present  in most temporal conceptual modelling systems. This systematic characterisation as T DLR theories is an  evidence of the adequacy of the T DLR temporal Description Logic for temporal conceptual modelling.  1 Introduction  In this paper the novel T DLR temporal logic is introduced...

Abduction with Negation as Failure for Active and Reactive Rules . Recent work has suggested abductive logic programming as a  suitable formalism to represent active databases and intelligent agents. In  particular, abducibles in abductive logic programs can be used to represent  actions, and integrity constaints in abductive logic programs can be  used to represent active rules of the kind encountered in active databases  and reactive rules incorporating reactive behaviour in agents. One would  expect that, in this approach, abductive proof procedures could provide  the engine underlying active database management systems and the behaviour  of agents. We analyse existing abductive proof procedures and  argue that they are inadequate in handling these applications. The inadequacy  is due to the inappropriate treatment of negative literals in  integrity constraints. We propose a new abductive proof procedure and  give examples of how this proof procedure can be used to achieve active  behaviour in (deductive) databases and reactivity in agents. Final...

Distributional Clustering of Words for Text Classification This paper applies Distributional Clustering (Pereira  et al. 1993) to document classification. The approach clusters words into groups based on the distribution of class labels associated with each word. Thus, unlike some other unsupervised dimensionality-reduction techniques, such as Latent Semantic Indexing, we are able to compress the feature space much more aggressively, while still maintaining high document classification accuracy. Experimental results obtained on three real-world data sets show that we can reduce the feature dimensionality by three orders of magnitude and lose only 2% accuracy---significantly better than Latent Semantic Indexing (Deerwester et al. 1990), class-based clustering (Brown et al. 1992), feature selection by mutual information (Yang and Pederson 1997), or Markovblanket -based feature selection (Koller and Sahami 1996). We also show that less aggressive clustering sometimes results in improved classification accuracy over classification without clusteri...

Text Classification by Bootstrapping with Keywords, EM and Shrinkage When applying text classification to complex tasks, it is tedious and expensive to hand-label the large amounts of training data necessary for good performance. This paper presents an alternative approach to text classification that requires no labeled documents; instead, it uses a small set of keywords per class, a class hierarchy and a large quantity of easilyobtained unlabeled documents. The keywords are used to assign approximate labels to the unlabeled documents by termmatching. These preliminary labels become the starting point for a bootstrapping process that learns a naive Bayes classifier using Expectation-Maximization and hierarchical shrinkage. When classifying a complex data set of computer science research papers into a 70-leaf topic hierarchy, the keywords alone provide 45% accuracy. The classifier learned by bootstrapping reaches 66% accuracy, a level close to human agreement on this task. 1 Introduction  When provided with enough labeled training examples, a variety of ...

It also provides a framework for the research on algorithms and methods for contentbased retrieval of images. A novel technique introduced in this paper facilitates automatic combination of the responses from multiple TS-SOMs and their hierarchical levels. The system tries to adapt to the user's preferences in selecting which images resemble each other in the particular sense the user is interested of.

Adapting the Locales Framework for Heuristic Evaluation of Groupware Heuristic evaluation is a rapid, cheap and effective way for identifying usability problems in single user systems. However, current heuristics do not provide guidance for discovering problems specific to groupware usability. In this paper, we take the Locales Framework and restate it as heuristics appropriate for evaluating groupware. These are: 1) Provide locales; 2) Provide awareness within locales; 3) Allow individual views; 4) Allow people to manage and stay aware of their evolving interactions; and 5) Provide a way to organize and relate locales to one another. To see if these new heuristics are useful in practice, we used them to inspect the interface of Teamwave Workplace, a commercial groupware product. We were successful in identifying the strengths of Teamwave as well as both major and minor interface problems.

If we can utilize such information  for the interaction between the human and the city, it can enhance the  value and the function of the city. In this paper we introduce the research  project "Mobile Info Search" in which we study the method of integrating  heterogeneous information in a location-oriented way for providing it in  a handy form with mobile computing. We have a prototype of Mobile  Info Search at http://www.kokono.net/, a location-based "search engine".  Local information such as yellow pages, maps, and relevant Web pages  at any location of Japan are provided with a simple interface. From the  analysis of test services, we will discuss the user issues and information  source issues; What kind of local information is welcomed? What can  we learn from collected documents? Through the experience of handling  various contents related to the real-world, we describe the potential of  the Internet information for the digital city efforts.  1

Point-based Temporal Extensions of SQL and their Efficient Implementation . This chapter introduces a new approach to temporal extensions of SQL. The main difference from most of the current proposals is the use single time points, rather than intervals or various other complexvalues for references to time, while still achieving efficient query evaluation. The proposed language, SQL/TP, extends the syntax of SQL/92 to handle temporal data in a natural way: it adds a single data type to represent a linearly ordered universe of time instants. The semantics of the new language naturally extends the standard SQL semantics and eliminates or fixes many of the problems connected with defining a precise semantics to temporal query languages based on explicit interval-valued temporal attributes. The efficient query evaluation procedure is based on a compilation technique that translates SQL/TP queries to SQL/92. Therefore existing off-shelf database systems can be used as back-ends for implementations based on this approach to manage temporal data. 1 Why another temp...

Integration of Spatial Join Algorithms for Joining Multiple Inputs Several techniques that compute the join between two spatial datasets have been proposed during the last decade. Among these methods, some consider existing indices for the joined inputs, while others treat datasets with no index, thus providing solutions for the case where at least one input comes as an intermediate result of another database operator. In this paper we analyze previous work on spatial joins and propose a novel algorithm, called slot index spatial join (SISJ), that efficiently computes the spatial join between two inputs, only one of which is indexed by an R-tree. Going one step further, we show how SISJ and other spatial join algorithms can be implemented as operators in a database environment that joins more than two spatial inputs. We study the differences between relational and spatial multi-way joins, and propose a dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes the execution of complex spatial queries.

Tracking Facial Features Using Gabor Wavelet Networks . This work presents a new method for automatic facial feature tracking in video sequences. In this method, a discrete face template is represented as a linear combination of continuous 2D odd-Gabor wavelet functions. The weights and 2D parameters (position, scale and orientation) of each wavelet are determined optimally so that the maximum of image information is preserved for a given number of wavelets. We have used this representation to achieve effective facial feature tracking that is robust to homogeneous illumination changes and affine deformations of the face image. Moreover, the tracking approach considers the overall geometry of the face, being robust to facial feature deformations such as eye blinking and smile. The number of wavelets in the representation may be chosen with respect to the available computational resources, even allowing real-time processing. 1

Relevance Feedback and Personalization: A Language Modeling Perspective Many approaches to personalization involve learning short-term and long-term user models. The user models provide context for queries and other interactions with the information system. In this paper, we discuss how language models can be used to represent context and support context-based techniques such as relevance feedback and query disambiguation.  1. Overview  From some perspectives, personalization has been studied in information retrieval for some time. If the goal of personalization is to improve the effectiveness of information access by adapting to individual users' needs, then techniques such as relevance feedback and filtering would certainly be considered to support personalization. There has also been considerable research done, mostly in the 1980s, on user modeling for information retrieval. This research had essentially the same goal as current research on personalization, which is to build a model of a user's interests and preferences over time. Filtering systems, too...

What can Partitioning do for your Data Warehouses and Data Marts? Efficient query processing is a critical requirement for data warehousing systems as decision support  applications often require minimum response times to answer complex, ad-hoc queries having aggregations,  multi-ways joins over vast repositories of data. This can be achieved by fragmenting warehouse  data. The data fragmentation concept in the context of distributed databases aims to reduce query  execution time and facilitates the parallel execution of queries. In this paper, we propose a methodology  for applying the fragmentation technique in a Data Warehouse (DW) star schema to reduce the total  query execution cost. We present an algorithm for fragmenting the tables of a star schema. During  the fragmentation process, we observe that the choice of the dimension tables used in fragmenting the  fact table plays an important role on overall performance. Therefore, we develop a greedy algorithm in  selecting "best" dimension tables. We propose an analytical cost model for executing a set of OLAP  queries on a fragmented star schema. Finally, we conduct some experiments to evaluate the utility of  fragmentation for efficiently executing OLAP queries.

Learning to Recognize Objects A learning account for the problem of object recognition is developed within the PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) model of learnability. The proposed approach makes no assumptions on the distribution of the observed objects, but quantifies success relative to its past experience. Most importantly, the success of learning an object representation is naturally tied to the ability to represent it as a function of some intermediate representations extracted from the image. We evaluate this approach in a large scale experimental study in which the SNoW learning architecture is used to learn representations for the 100 objects in the Columbia Object Image Database (COIL-100). The SNoW-based method is shown to outperform other methods in terms of recognition rates; its performance degrades gracefully when the training data contains fewer views and in the presence of occlusion noise.

Learning Lateral Interactions for Feature Binding and Sensory Segmentation We present a new approach to the supervised learning of lateral interactions  for the competitive layer model (CLM) dynamic feature binding  architecture. The method is based on consistency conditions, which were  recently shown to characterize the attractor states of this linear threshold  recurrent network. For a given set of training examples the learning problem  is formulated as a convex quadratic optimization problem in the lateral  interaction weights. An efficient dimension reduction of the learning  problem can be achieved by using a linear superposition of basis interactions.  We show the successful application of the method to a medical  image segmentation problem of fluorescence microscope cell images.  1

Automated Derivation of Complex Agent Architectures from Analysis Specifications . Multiagent systems have been touted as a way to meet the need for  distributed software systems that must operate in dynamic and complex  environments. However, in order for multiagent systems to be effective, they  must be reliable and robust. Engineering multiagent systems is a non-trivial  task, providing ample opportunity for even experts to make mistakes. Formal  transformation systems can provide automated support for synthesizing  multiagent systems, which can greatly improve their correctness and reliability.

Coordinating Adaptations in Open Service Architectures An Open Service Architecture (OSA) is a software structure that makes an open set of information services available to an open set of users. The World Wide Web constitutes the most outstanding example of an OSA as of today. An important feature of an OSA is personalization, i.e. adapting the user interface, functionality, and information of services to its users. However, designers of such a feature are facing many problems, perhaps the biggest one being coordination. If services fail to coordinate how they adapt to users, chances are that the whole point of performing the adaptation, i.e. helping the user, is lost.  In this thesis, I lay out a framework for describing and reasoning about adaptive systems in Open Service Architectures, with a special emphasis on coordination. This framework is mainly meant for analysis and design, but some of the ideas presented are also suitable as metaphors for implementations.

Compression of Inverted Indexes For Fast Query Evaluation Compression reduces both the size of indexes and the time needed to evaluate queries. In this paper, we revisit the compression of inverted lists of document postings that store the position and frequency of indexed terms, considering two approaches to improving retrieval efficiency: better implementation and better choice of integer compression schemes. First, we propose several simple optimisations to well-known integer compression schemes, and show experimentally that these lead to significant reductions in time. Second, we explore the impact of choice of compression scheme on retrieval efficiency. In experiments on large collections of data, we show two surprising results: use of simple byte-aligned codes halves the query evaluation time compared to the most compact Golomb-Rice bitwise compression schemes; and, even when an index fits entirely in memory, byte-aligned codes result in faster query evaluation than does an uncompressed index, emphasising that the cost of transferring data from memory to the CPU cache is less for an appropriately compressed index than for an uncompressed index. Moreover, byte-aligned schemes have only a modest space overhead: the most compact schemes result in indexes that are around 10 % of the size of the collection, while a byte-aligned scheme is around 13%. We conclude that fast byte-aligned codes should be used to store integers in inverted lists.

Such systems are typically extremely complex and it is often useful to be able to simulate an agent-based system to learn more about its behaviour or investigate the implications of alternative architectures. In this paper, we discuss the application of distributed discrete-event simulation techniques to the simulation of multi-agent systems. We identify the efficient distribution of the agents' environment as a key problem in the simulation of agent-based systems, and present an approach to the decomposition of the environment which facilitates load balancing.

A Replicable Web-Based Negotiation Server For E-Commerce This paper describes our ongoing R&D effort in developing a replicable, Web-based negotiation server to conduct bargaining-type negotiations between clients (i.e., buyers and sellers) in e-commerce. Multiple copies of this server can be paired with existing Web-servers to provide negotiation capabilities. Each client can select a trusted negotiation server to represent his/her interests. Web-based GUI tools are used by clients in a build-time registration process to specify the requirements, constraints, negotiation strategic rules, and preference scoring methods related to the buying or selling of a product. The registration information is used by the negotiation servers to conduct negotiations automatically on behalf of the clients. In this paper, we present the architecture of the negotiation server and the framework for automated negotiations, and describe a number of communication primitives, which make up the negotiation protocol. We have developed a constraint satisfaction processor (CSP) to evaluate a negotiation proposal against the registered constraints. An Event-Trigger-Rule (ETR) server manages events and triggers the execution of strategic rules, which may relax constraints, notify clients, or perform other operations. Strategic rules can be added and modified at run-time to deal with the dynamic nature of negotiations. A cost-benefit analysis performs quantitative analysis of alternative negotiation conditions. We have implemented a prototype system to demonstrate automated negotiations among buyers and suppliers in a supply chain management system.

Topical Locality in the Web Most web pages are linked to others with related content. This idea, combined with another that says that text in, and possibly around, HTML anchors describe the pages to which they point, is the foundation for a usable WorldWide Web. In this paper, we examine to what extent these ideas hold by empirically testing whether topical locality mirrors spatial locality of pages on the Web. In particular, we find that the likelihood of linked pages having similar textual content to be high; the similarity of sibling pages increases when the links from the parent are close together; titles, descriptions, and anchor text represent at least part of the target page; and that anchor text may be a useful discriminator among unseen child pages. These results show the foundations necessary for the success of many web systems, including search engines, focused crawlers, linkage analyzers, and intelligent web agents.

The Interoperability Problem: Bringing together Mobile Agents and Agent Communication Languages Interoperability is a central issue for both the mobile agents community and the wider agents community. Unfortunately, the interoperability concerns are different between the two communities. As a result, inter-agent communication is an issue that has been addressed in a limited manner by the mobile agents community. Agent communication languages (ACLs) have been developed as tools with the capacity to integrate disparate sources of information and support interoperability but have achieved limited use by mobile agents. We investigate the origins of the differences of perspective on agent-to-agent communication, examine the reasons for the relative lack of interest in ACLs by mobile agents researchers and explore the integration of ACLs into mobile agents frameworks.

Side Constraints and Non-Price Attributes in Markets In most real-world (electronic) marketplaces, there  are other considerations besides maximizing immediate  economic value. We present a sound way  of taking such considerations into account via side  constraints and non-price attributes. Side constraints  have a significant impact on the complexity  of market clearing. Budget constraints, a limit on  the number of winners, and XOR-constraints make  even noncombinatorial markets ##-complete to  clear. The latter two make markets ##-complete  to clear even if bids can be accepted partially. This  is surprising since, as we show, even combinatorial  markets with a host of very similar side constraints  can be cleared in polytime. An extreme equality  constraint makes combinatorial markets polytime  clearable even if bids have to be accepted entirely  or not at all. Finally, we present a way to  take into account additional attributes using a bid  re-weighting scheme, and prove that it does not  change the complexity of clearing. All of the results  hold for auctions as well as exchanges, with  and without free disposal.  1

One-way Functions are Essential for Single-Server Private Information Retrieval Private Information Retrieval (PIR) protocols allow a user to read information from a database without revealing to the server storing the database which information he has read. Kushilevitz and Ostrovsky [23] construct, based on the quadratic residuosity assumption, a single-server PIR protocol with small communication complexity. Cachin, Micali, and Stadler [5] present a single-server PIR protocol with a smaller communication complexity, based on the (new) \Phihiding assumption. A major question, addressed in the present work, is what assumption is the minimal assumption necessary for the construction of single-server private information retrieval protocols with small communication complexity. We prove that if there is a (0-error) PIR protocol in which the server sends less than n bits then one-way functions exist (where n is the number of bits in the database). That is, even saving one bit compared to the naive protocol, in which the entire database is sent, already requires one-way...

A Social-Psychological Model for Synthetic Actors In the Virtual Theater project, we provide synthetic actors that portray fictive characters by improvising their behavior in a multimedia environment. Actors are either autonomous or avatars directed by users. Their improvisation is based on the directions they receive and the context. Directions can take different forms: high-level scenarios, user commands, and personality changes in the character portrayed. In this paper, we look at this last form of direction. We propose a social-psychological model, in which we can define personality traits that depend on the values of moods and attitudes. We show how such a model can be exploited by synthetic actors to produce performances that are theatrically interesting, believable, and diverse.

MIRROR: A State-Conscious Concurrency Control Protocol for Replicated Real-Time Databases Data replication is one of the main techniques by which database systems can hope to meet the stringent temporal constraints of current time-critical applications, especially Web-based directory and electronic commerce services. A pre-requisite for realizing the benefits of replication, however, is the development of high-performance concurrency control mechanisms. We present in this paper MIRROR (Managing Isolation in Replicated Realtime Object Repositories), a concurrency control protocol specifically designed for firm-deadline applications operating on replicated real-time databases. MIRROR augments the optimistic two-phase locking (O2PL) algorithm developed for non real-time databases with a novel and simple to implement state-based conflict resolution mechanism to fine-tune real-time performance. Using a detailed simulation model, we compare MIR-ROR‚Äôs performance against the real-time versions of a representative set of classical protocols for a range of transaction workloads and system configurations. Our performance studies show that (a) the relative performance characteristics of replica concurrency control algorithms in the real-time environment could be significantly different from their performance in a traditional (non-real-time) database system, (b) MIRROR provides the best performance in both fully and partially replicated environments for real-time applications with low to moderate update frequencies, and (c) MIRROR‚Äôs conflict resolution mechanism works almost as well as more sophisticated (and difficult to implement) strategies.

Computing Geographical Scopes of Web Resources Many information resources on the web are relevant primarily to limited geographical communities. For instance, web sites containing information on restaurants, theaters, and apartment rentals are relevant primarily to web users in geographical proximity to these locations. In contrast, other information resources are relevant to a broader geographical community. For instance, an on-line newspaper may be relevant to users across the United States. Unfortunately, most current web search engines largely ignore the geographical scope of web resources. In this paper, we introduce techniques for automatically computing the geographical scope of web resources, based on the textual content of the resources, as well as on the geographical distribution of hyperlinks to them. We report an extensive experimental evaluation of our strategies using real web data. Finally, we describe a geographically-aware search engine that we have built using our techniques for determining the geographical scope of web resources. 1

In an attempt to find methods that support navigation within virtual space, this paper describes an investigation of cinematography conventions.

Evaluation of Access Structures for Discretely Moving Points Several applications require management of data which is spatially dynamic, e.g., tracking of battle ships or moving cells in a blood sample. The capability of handling the temporal aspect, i.e., the history of such type of data, is also important. This paper presents and evaluates three temporal extensions of the R-tree, the 3D R-tree, the 2+3 R-tree and the HR-tree, which are capable of indexing spatiotemporal data. Our experiments focus on discretely moving points (i.e., points standing at a specific location for a time period and then moving "instantaneously", and so on and so forth). We explore several parameters, e.g., initial spatial distribution, spatial query area and temporal query length.

CREAM - Creating relational metadata with a component-based, ontology-driven annotation framework Richly interlinked, machine-understandable data constitutes the basis for  the Semantic Web. Annotating web documents is one of the major techniques for creating  metadata on the Web. However, annotation tools so far are restricted in their  capabilities of providing richly interlinked and truely machine-understandable data.  They basically allow the user to annotate with plain text according to a template structure,  such as Dublin Core. We here present CREAM (Creating RElational, Annotationbased  Metadata), a framework for an annotation environment that allows to construct  relational metadata, i.e. metadata that comprises class instances and relationship instances.  These instances are not based on a fix structure, but on a domain ontology.

Models for Information Integration: Turning Local-as-View Into Global-as-View There are basically two approaches for designing a data integration system. In the global-as-view approach, one defines the concepts in the global schema as views over the sources, whereas in the local-as-view approach, one characterizes the sources as views over the global schema. The goal of this paper is to verify whether we can transform a data integration system built with the local-as-view approach into a system following the global-as-view approach. We study the problem in a setting where the global schema is expressed in the relational model with inclusion dependencies, and the queries used in the integration systems (both the queries on the global schema, and the views in the mapping) are expressed in the language of conjunctive queries. The result we present is that such a transformation exists: we can always transform a local-as-view system into a global-as-view system such that, for each query, the set of answers to the query wrt the former is the same as the set of answers wrt the latter.

An Evolutionary Algorithm Using Multivariate Discretization for Decision Rule Induction We describe EDRL-MD, an evolutionary algorithm-based  system, for learning decision rules from databases. The main novelty of  our approach lies in dealing with continuous - valued attributes. Most of  decision rule learners use univariate discretization methods, which search  for threshold values for one attribute at the same time. In contrast to  them, EDRL-MD simultaneously searches for threshold values for all  continuous-valued attributes, when inducing decision rules. We call this  approach multivariate discretization. Since multivariate discretization is  able to capture interdependencies between attributes it may improve  the accuracy of obtained rules. The evolutionary algorithm uses problem  specific operators and variable-length chromosomes, which allows it to  search for complete rulesets rather than single rules. The preliminary  results of the experiments on some real-life datasets are presented.

MuTACLP: A language for temporal reasoning with multiple theories In this paper we introduce MuTACLP, a knowledge representation language which provides facilities for modeling and handling temporal information, together with some basic operators for combining different temporal knowledge bases. The proposed approach stems from two separate lines of research: the general studies on meta-level operators on logic programs introduced by Brogi et al. [6, 8] and Temporal Annotated Constraint Logic Programming (TACLP) de ned by Fr√ºhwirth [14]. In MuTACLP atoms are annotated with temporal information which are managed via a constraint theory, as in TACLP. Mechanisms for structuring programs and combining separate knowledge bases are provided through meta-level operators. The language is given two different and equivalent semantics, a top-down semantics which exploits meta-logic, and a bottom-up semantics based on an immediate consequence operator.

Beyond Eigenfaces: Probabilistic Matching for Face Recognition We propose a novel technique for direct visual matching of images for the purposes of face recognition and database search. Specifically, we argue in favor of a probabilistic measure of similarity, in contrast to simpler methods which are based on standard L2 norms (e.g., template matching) or subspace-restricted norms (e.g., eigenspace matching). The proposed similarity measure is based on a Bayesian analysis of image differences: we model two mutually exclusive classes of variation between two facial images: intra-personal (variations in appearance of the same individual, due to different expressions or lighting) and extra-personal (variations in appearance due to a difference in identity). The high-dimensional probability density functions for each respective class are then obtained from training data using an eigenspace density estimation technique and subsequently used to compute a similarity measure based on the a posteriori probability of membership in the intrapersonal class,...

Quasi-Stable Semantics of Logic Programs this paper, we introduce a new semantic theory for logic programs. We choose the Well-Founded Semantics (WFS) [23] as our starting point because it has many desirable features. For any logic program there exists a unique well-founded partial model which can be defined in a constructive way. WFS naturally extends the semantics for a large class of logic programs, including stratified and locally stratified programs (see [17] and [23]). Despite its merits, it can be argued that the WFS is too "sceptical". For many programs it gives the empty set as their intended meaning. It is thus silent on all atoms though it may be reasonable to expect that something should be concluded from the information given. For an illustrative example, see program P 1 in section 4. There are many proposals for extending the WFS such as the generalised well-founded semantics GWFS [1], the well-founded-by-case-semantics WFSC [20], the extended well-founded semantics WFSE [11], the strong well-founded semantics WFS S [5], and the O-semantics [15]. The relationship between these semantic theories for logic programming is also studied in [6]. Here we propose another nondeterministic extension of the WFS. The other dominant semantic model for logic programs is the stable model semantics [10]. Compared with the WFS, the stable model semantics is "credulous": it derives much more information than the WFS though this is non-deterministic or "disjunctive" in the sense that there may be several stable models for a given logic program. The chief drawback of this semantics is that a stable model is not defined for all logic programs. In addition stable model semantics gives rise to anomalies in some circumstances. See the program P 3 in section 4, borrowed from [23]. A modification of the stable model seman...

Shopbots and Pricebots Shopbots are agents that automatically search the Internet to obtain information about prices and other attributes of goods and services. They herald a future in which autonomous agents profoundly influence electronic markets. In this study, a simple economic model is proposed and analyzed, which is intended to quantify some of the likely impacts of a proliferation of shopbots and other economically-motivated software agents. In addition, this paper reports on simulations of pricebots --- adaptive, pricesetting agents which firms may well implement to combat, or even take advantage of, the growing community of shopbots. This study forms part of a larger research program that aims to provide insights into the impact of agent technology on the nascent information economy.  1 Introduction  Shopbots, agents that automatically search the Internet for goods and/or services on behalf of consumers, herald a future in which autonomous agents become an essential component of nearly every facet o...

Analyzing Relational Databases Using Rough Set Based Methods One of the most important problems in KDD applications is a size of real-world databases. In practical problems data may contain millions of records in many data tables bounded by relations. On the other hand, most of theoretical works and practical applications concentrate on relatively small data sets collected in single tables. The paper proposes a new approach to the problem of analysis of relational databases. The proposed methodology woks in adaptive way: if a considered data table is not sufficient to create satisfactory set of rules, new attributes (generated by arithmetical operations or based on database relations) are added to information system.

A Variable Depth Search Algorithm for the Generalized Assignment Problem : A variable depth search procedure (abbreviated as VDS) is a generalization of the local search method, which was rst successfully applied by Lin and Kernighan to the traveling salesman problem and the graph partitioning problem. The main idea is to adaptively change the size of neighborhood so that it can eectively traverse larger search space while keeping the amount of computational time reasonable. In this paper, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on VDS for the generalized assignment problem, which is one of the representative combinatorial optimization problems known to be NP-hard. To the authors' knowledge, most of the previously proposed algorithms (with some exceptions) conduct the search within the feasible region; however, there are instances for which the search within feasible region is not advantageous because the feasible region is very small or is combinatorially complicated to search. Therefore, we allow in our algorithm to search into the infeasible region as w...

Optimizing Search by Showing Results In Context We developed and evaluated seven interfaces for integrating semantic category information with Web search results. List interfaces were based on the familiar ranked-listing of search results, sometimes augmented with a category name for each result. Category interfaces also showed page titles and/or category names, but re-organized the search results so that items in the same category were grouped together visually. Our user studies show that all Category interfaces were more effective than List interfaces even when lists were augmented with category names for each result. The best category performance was obtained when both category names and individual page titles were presented. Either alone is better than a list presentation, but both together provide the most effective means for allowing users to quickly examining search results. These results provide a better understanding of the perceptual and cognitive factors underlying the advantage of category groupings and provide some practical guidance to Web search interface designers.

Towards Hybrid Interface Specification for Virtual Environments . Many new multi-modal interaction techniques have been proposed for interaction in a virtual world. Often these techniques are of a hybrid nature combining continuous interaction, such as gestures and moving video, with discrete interaction, such as pushing buttons to select items. Unfortunately the description of the behavioural aspects of these interaction techniques found in the literature is informal and incomplete. This can make it hard to compare and evaluate their usability. This paper investigates the use of HyNet to give concise and precise specifications of hybrid interaction techniques. HyNet is an extension of high-level Petri Nets developed for specification and verification of hybrid systems, i.e. mathematical models including both continuous and discrete elements. 1 Introduction New technologies for virtual environments (VEs) have been eagerly embraced by VE users and developers. The process of diffusing this technology into a wider range of products has, i...

Autoepistemic Logic of Knowledge and Beliefs In recent years, various formalizations of non-monotonic reasoning and different semantics for normal and disjunctive logic programs have been proposed, including autoepistemic logic, circumscription, CWA, GCWA, ECWA, epistemic specifications, stable, well-founded, stationary and static semantics of normal and disjunctive logic programs. In this paper we introduce a simple non-monotonic knowledge representation framework which isomorphically contains all of the above mentioned non-monotonic formalisms and semantics as special cases and yet is significantly more expressive than each one of these formalisms considered individually. The new formalism, called the Autoepistemic Logic of Knowledge and Beliefs, AELB, is obtained by augmenting Moore's autoepistemic logic, AEL, already employing the knowledge operator , L, with an additional belief operator , B. As a result, we are able to reason not only about formulae F which are known to be true (i.e., those for which LF holds) but also abou...

Some of these algorithms have already been tested experimentally, while others are still beyond the current state-of-theart.

Feasible Formations of Multi-Agent Systems Formations of multi-agent systems, such as mobile robots, satellites. and aircraft, require individual agents to satisfy their kinematic equations while constantly maintaining inter-agent constraints. In this paper, we develop a systematic framework for studying formation feasibility of multi-agent systems. In particular, we consider undirected formations for centralized formations, and directed formations for decentralized formations. In each case, we determine differential geometric conditions that guarantee formation feasibility given the individual agent kinematics. Our framework also enables us to extract a smaller control system that describes the group kinematics while maintaining all formation constraints.

Towards Flexible Teamwork in Persistent Teams: Extended Report Teamwork is a critical capability in multi-agent environments. Many such environments mandate that the agents and agent-teams must be persistent i.e., exist over long periods of time. Agents in such persistent teams are bound together by their long-term common interests and goals. This paper focuses on flexible teamwork in such persistent teams. Unfortunately, while previous work has investigated flexible teamwork, persistent teams remain unexplored. For flexible tamwork, one promising approach that has emerged is model-based, i.e., providing agents with general models of teamwork that explicitly specify their commitments in teamwork. Such models enable agents to autonomously reason about coordination. Unfortunately, for persistent teams, such models may lead to coordination and communication actions that while locally optimal, are highly problematic for the team's long-term goals. We present a decisiontheoretic technique to enable persistent teams to overcome such limitations of the m...

Pushing the limits of ATC user interface design beyond S&M interaction: the DigiStrips experience Most designs proposed for air traffic control workstations are based on user interface designs from the early 1980s, though research in user interaction has produced innovations since then. Project Toccata federates a series of research held at CENA on new user interfaces and services for ATC. Virtuosi and DigiStrips are two prototypes developed for Toccata, which make use of touch screens and served as a basis for research on the use of graphical design techniques in user interfaces. This paper describes the lessons learnt in that experience and argues that techniques such as animation, font design, careful use of graphical design techniques can augment the possibilities of user interface design and improve the usability of systems.

Logic-Based User-Defined Aggregates for the Next Generation of Database Systems this paper, we provide logic-based foundations for the extended aggregate constructs required by advanced database applications. In particular, we focus on data mining applications and show that they require user-defined aggregates extended with early returns. Thus, we propose a simple formalization of extended user-defined aggregates using the nondeterministic construct of choice. We obtain programs that have a formal semantics based on the concept of total stable models, but are also amenable to efficient implementation. Our formalization leads to a simple syntactic characterization of user-defined aggregates that are monotone with respect to set containment. Therefore, these aggregates can be freely used in recursive programs, and the fixpoints for such programs can be computed efficiently using the standard techniques of deductive databases. We describe the many new applications of user-defined aggregates, and their implementation for the logical data language LDL++. Finally, we discuss the transfer of this technology to SQL databases. 1 Introduction

Agent UML Class Diagrams Revisited Multiagent system designers already use Agent UML in order to represent the interaction protocols [8] [2]. Agent UML is a graphical modeling language based on UML. As UML, Agent UML provides several types of representation covering the description of the system, of the components, the dynamics of the system and the deployment. Since agents and objects are not exactly the same, one can guess that the UML class diagram has to be changed for describing agents. The aim of this paper is to present how to extend Agent UML class diagrams in order to represent agents. We then compare our approach to Bauer's approach [1].

Support Vector Machine Active Learning with Applications to Text Classification . Support vector machines have met with significant success in numerous real-world learning tasks. However, like most machine learning algorithms, they are generally applied using a randomly selected training set classified in advance. In many settings, we also have the option of using pool-based active learning. Instead of using a randomly selected training set, the learner has access to a pool of unlabeled instances and can request the labels for some number of them. We introduce a new algorithm for performing active learning with support vector machines, i.e., an algorithm for choosing which instances to request next. We provide a theoretical motivation for the algorithm using the notion of a version space. We present experimental results showing that employing our active learning method can significantly reduce the need for labeled training instances in both the standard inductive and transductive settings.

Mining Soft-Matching Rules from Textual Data Text mining concerns the discovery of knowledge  from unstructured textual data. One important task  is the discovery of rules that relate specific words  and phrases. Although existing methods for this  task learn traditional logical rules, soft-matching  methods that utilize word-frequency information  generally work better for textual data.

Face Recognition Using Shape and Texture We introduce in this paper a new face coding and recognition method which employs the Enhanced FLD (Fisher Linear Discrimimant) Model (EFM) on integrated shape (vector) and texture (`shape-free' image) information. Shape encodes the feature geometry of a face while texture provides a normalized shape-free image by warping the original face image to the mean shape, i.e., the average of aligned shapes. The dimensionalities of the shape and the texture spaces are first reduced using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The corresponding but reduced shape and texture features are then integrated through a normalization procedure to form augmented features. The dimensionality reduction procedure, constrained by EFM for enhanced generalization, maintains a proper balance between the spectral energy needs of PCA for adequate representation, and the FLD discrimination requirements, that the eigenvalues of the within-class scatter matrix should not include small trailing values after the dimensionality reduction procedure as they appear in the denominator.

Direct Policy Search using Paired Statistical Tests Direct policy search is a practical way to solve reinforcement learning problems involving continuous state and action spaces. The goal becomes finding policy parameters that maximize a noisy objective function. The Pegasus method converts this stochastic optimization problem into a deterministic one, by using fixed start states and fixed random number sequences for comparing policies (Ng & Jordan, 1999). We evaluate Pegasus, and other paired comparison methods, using the mountain car problem, and a difficult pursuer-evader problem. We conclude that: (i) Paired tests can improve performance of deterministic and stochastic optimization procedures. (ii) Our proposed alternatives to Pegasus can generalize better, by using a different test statistic, or changing the scenarios during learning. (iii) Adapting the number of trials used for each policy comparison yields fast and robust learning. 1.

Towards Lifetime Maintenance of Case Base Indexes for Continual Case Based Reasoning Abstract. One of the key areas of case based reasoning is how to main-tain the domain knowledge in the face of a changing environment. During case retrieval, a key process of CBR, feature-value pairs attached to the cases are used to rank the cases for the user. Different feature-value pairs may have different importance measures in this process, often represented by feature weights attached to the cases. How to maintain the weights so that they are up to date and current is one of the key factors deter-mining the success of CBR. Our focus in this paper is on the lifetime maintenance of the feature-weights in a case base. Our task is to de-sign a CBR maintenance system that not only learns a user's preference in the selection of cases but also tracks the user's evolving preferences in the cases. Our approach is to maintain feature weighting in a dy-namic context through an integration with a learning system inspired by a back-propagation neural network. In this paper we explain the new system architecture and reasoning algorithms, contrasting our approach with the previous ones. The effectiveness of the system is demonstrated through experiments in a real world application domain. 1

Automatic Identification of Text In Digital Video Key Frames Scene and graphic text can provide important supplemental index information in video sequences. In this paper we address the problem automatically identifying text regions in digital video key frames. The text contained in video frames is typically very noisy because it is aliased and/or digitized at a much lower resolution than typical document images, making identification, extraction and recognition difficult. The proposed method is based on the use of a hybrid wavelet/neural network segmenter on a series of overlapping small windows to classify regions which contain text. To detect text over a wide range of font sizes, the method is applied to a pyramid of images and the regions identified at each level are integrated. 1.

The broadcast news audio was transcribed using a 2-pass gender-dependent HTK speech recogniser which ran at 50 times real time and gave an overall word error rate of 24.8%, the lowest in the track. The Okapi-based retrieval engine used in TREC-6 by the City/Cambridge University collaboration was supplemented by improving the stop-list, adding a bad-spelling mapper and stemmer exceptions list, adding word-pair information, integrating part-of-speech weighting on query terms and including some pre-search statistical expansion. The final system gave an average precision of 0.4817 on the reference and 0.4509 on the automatic transcription, with the R-precision being 0.4603 and 0.4330 respectively. The paper also presents results on a new set of 60 queries with assessments for the TREC-6 test document data used for development purposes, and analyses the relationship between recognition accuracy, as defined by a pre-processed term error rate, and retrieval performance for both sets of data. 1.

A General Learning Approach to Multisensor Based Control using Statistic Indices We propose a concept for integrating multiple sensors in real-time robot control. To increase the controller robustness under diverse uncertainties, the robot systematically generates series of sensor data (as robot state) while memorising the corresponding motion parameters. From the collection of (multi-) sensor trajectories, statistical indices like principal components for each sensor type can be extracted. If the sensor data are preselected as output relevant, these principal components can be used very efficiently to approximately represent the original perception scenarios. After this dimension reduction procedure, a non-linear fuzzy controller, e.g. a B-spline type, can be trained to map the subspace projection into the robot control parameters. We apply the approach to a real robot system with two arms and multiple vision and force/torque sensors. These external sensors are used simultaneously to control the robot arm performing insertion and screwing operations. The successful experiments show that the robustness as well as the precision of robot control can be enhanced by integrating multiple additional sensors using this concept. 1

Wearable Computing Meets Ubiquitous Computing: Reaping the best of both worlds This paper describes what we see as fundamental diculties in both the pure ubiquitous computing and pure wearable computing paradigms when applied to context-aware applications.

Computers Seeing People this paper, we present methods that give machines the ability to see people, interpret their actions and interact with them. We present the motivating factors behind this work, examples of how such computational methods are developed and their applications. The basic reason for providing machines the ability to see people really depends on the task we are associating with a machine. An industrial vision system aimed at extracting defects on an assembly line need not know anything about people. Similarly, a computer used for email and text writing need not see and perceive the users gestures and expressions. However, if our interest is to build intelligent machines that can work with us, support our needs and be our helpers, than it maybe required for these machines to know more about who they are supporting and helping. If our computers are to do more then support our text-based needs like writing papers, spreadsheets, and communicating via email; perhaps take on a role of being a personal assistant, then the ability to see a person is essential. Such an ability to perceive people is something that we take for granted in our everyday interactions with each other. At present our model of a machine or more specifically of a computer is something that is placed in the corner of the room. It is deaf, dumb, and blind, having no sense of the environment that it is in or of the person that is near it. We communicate with this computer using a coded sequence of tappings on a keyboard. Imagine a computer that knows that you are near it, that you are looking at it, knows who you are and what you are trying to do. Imagine a machine that can interpret a video signal based on who is in the scene and what they are doing. Such abilities in a computer are hard to imagine, unless it has...

Active Learning of Partially Hidden Markov Models We consider the task of learning hidden Markov models (HMMs) when only partially (sparsely) labeled observation sequences are available for training. This setting is motivated by the information extraction problem, where only few tokens in the training documents are given a semantic tag while most tokens are unlabeled. We first describe the partially hidden Markov model together with an algorithm for learning HMMs from partially labeled data. We then present an active learning algorithm that selects "difficult" unlabeled tokens and asks the user to label them. We study empirically by how much active learning reduces the required data labeling effort, or increases the quality of the learned model achievable with a given amount of user effort.

Continuous-based Heuristics for Graph and Tree Isomorphisms, with Application to Computer Vision We present a new (continuous) quadratic programming approach for graph- and tree-isomorphism problems which is based on an equivalent maximum clique formulation. The approach is centered around a fundamental result proved by Motzkin and Straus in the mid-1960s, and recently expanded in various ways, which allows us to formulate the maximum clique problem in terms of a standard quadratic program. The attractive feature of this formulation is that a clear one-to-one correspondence exists between the solutions of the quadratic programs and those in the original, combinatorial problems. To approximately solve the program we use the so-called "replicator" equations, a class of straightforward continuous- and discrete-time dynamical systems developed in various branches of theoretical biology. We show how, despite their inherent inability to escape from local solutions, they nevertheless provide experimental results which are competitive with those obtained using more sophisticated mean-fiel...

Building An Artificial Brain Using An FPGA Based "CAM-Brain Machine" This paper reports on recent progress made in ATR's attempt to build a 10,000 evolved neural net module artificial brain to control the behaviors of a life sized robot kitten. 1. Introduction This paper presents progress in ATR's Artificial Brain (CAM-Brain) Project. The broad aim of ATR's artificial brain project, is to build/grow/evolve an artificial brain containing a billion artificial neurons by the year 2001. The basic ideas of the CAM-Brain Project are as follows. Use cellular automata (CA) as the foundation upon which to grow and evolve neural network circuits, with user defined functionality. The state of each cellular automata cell can be stored in one or two bytes of RAM. Since nowadays it is possible to have a gigabyte of RAM in one's workstation, there is a huge space in which to store the CA cell states, more than enough to contain an artificial brain. The next consideration in the CAM-Brain Project was how to evolve these neural networks quickly enough for "Brain Buildin...

Markovian Models for Sequential Data Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models of sequential data that have been used successfully in many machine learning applications, especially for speech recognition. Furthermore, in the last few years, many new and promising probabilistic models related to HMMs have been proposed. We first summarize the basics of HMMs, and then review several recent related learning algorithms and extensions of HMMs, including in particular hybrids of HMMs with artificial neural networks, Input-Output HMMs (which are conditional HMMs using neural networks to compute probabilities), weighted transducers, variable-length Markov models and Markov switching state-space models. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges of future research in this very active area. 1 Introduction  Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are statistical models of sequential data that have been used successfully in many applications in artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, speech recognition, and modeling of biological ...

This methodology consists of two steps.  First, the contents of databases are indicated approximately by database representatives. Databases  are ranked using their representatives in a certain order with respect to the given query. We provide  a necessary and sufficient condition to rank the databases optimally. In order to satisfy this necessary  and sufficient condition, we provide three estimation methods. One estimation method is intended for  short queries; the other two are for all queries. Second, we provide an algorithm, OptDocRetrv, to  retrieve documents from the databases according to their rank and in a particular way. We show that  if the databases containing the n most similar documents for a given query are ranked ahead of other  databases, our methodology will guarantee the retrieval of the n most similar d...

Monadic Datalog and the Expressive Power of Languages for Web Information Extraction Research on information extraction from Web pages (wrapping) has seen much activity in recent times (particularly systems implementations), but little work has been done on formally studying the expressiveness of the formalisms proposed or on the theoretical foundations of wrapping. In this paper, we first study monadic datalog as a wrapping language (over ranked or unranked tree structures). Using previous work by Neven and Schwentick, we show that this simple language is equivalent to full monadic second order logic (MSO) in its ability to specify wrappers. We believe that MSO has the right expressiveness required for Web information extraction and thus propose MSO as a yardstick for evaluating and comparing wrappers. Using the above result, we study the kernel fragment Elog- of the Elog wrapping language used in the Lixto system (a visual wrapper generator). The striking fact here is that Elog- exactly captures MSO, yet is easier to use. Indeed, programs in this language can be entirely visually specified. We also formally compare Elog to other wrapping languages proposed in the literature.

Experiences in the use of Mobile Agents for developing distributed applications Introduction  The recent development of telecommunication networks has contributed to the success of distributed systems, and has stimulated the research for a new generation of applications, such as the access to remote databases, the Web, and e-commerce. Traditional programming in distributed systems has been based on the well-known client/server paradigm. An alternative to such traditional mechanisms has recently been spreading, and is based on the use of environments that give a sort of "code mobility" [2]. By this term we mean the possibility to change dynamically at run-time the binding between the software components of an application and their physical location within a network of computers.  Code mobility is the main feature on which mobile agent systems are based: a mobile agent can be deemed as a software module able to autonomously perform the task assigned by the user, by moving (if necessary) from a node of the network to the other, in order to collect the informa

Optimizing Search Engines using Clickthrough Data This paper presents an approach to automatically optimizing the retrieval quality of search engines using clickthrough data. Intuitively, a good information retrieval system should present relevant documents high in the ranking, with less relevant documents following below. While previous approaches to learning retrieval functions from examples exist, they typically require training data generated from relevance judgments by experts. This makes them difficult and expensive to apply. The goal of this paper is to develop a method that utilizes clickthrough data for training, namely the query-log of the search engine in connection with the log of links the users clicked on in the presented ranking. Such clickthrough data is available in abundance and can be recorded at very low cost. Taking a Support Vector Ma- chine (SVM) approach, this paper presents a method for learning retrieval functions. From a theoretical perspective, this method is shown to be well-founded in a risk minimiza- tion framework. Furthermore, it is shown to be feasible even for large sets of queries and features. The theoretical results are verified in a controlled experiment. It shows that the method can effectively adapt the retrieval function of a meta-search engine to a particular group of users, outperforming Google in terms of retrieval quality after only a couple of hundred training examples.

Effective and Efficient Automatic Database Selection We examine a class of database selection algorithms that require only document frequency information. The CORI algorithm is an instance of this class of algorithms. In previous work, we showed that CORI is more effective than gGlOSS when evaluated against a relevance-based standard. In this paper, we introduce a family of other algorithms in this class and examine components of these algorithms and of the CORI algorithm to begin identifying the factors responsible for their performance. We establish that the class of algorithms studied here is more effective and efficient than  gGlOSS and is applicable to a wider variety of operational environments. In particular, this methodology is completely decoupled from the database indexing technology so is as useful in heterogeneous environments as in homogeneous environments.  1 Introduction  Database or collection selection [2, 6, 10, 8, 13, 14, 15, 9] is a fundamental problem in distributed searching.

Strategies in Combined Learning via Logic Programs Abstract. We discuss the adoption of a three-valued setting for inductive concept learning. Distinguishing between what is true, what is false and what is unknown can be useful in situations where decisions have tobetaken on the basis of scarce, ambiguous, or downright contradictory information. In a three-valued setting, we learn a de nition for both the target concept and its opposite, considering positive and negative examples as instances of two disjoint classes. To this purpose, we adopt Extended Logic Programs (ELP) under a Well-Founded Semantics with explicit negation (WFSX) as the representation formalism for learning, and show how ELPs can be used to specify combinations of strategies in a declarative way also coping with contradiction and exceptions. Explicit negation is used to represent the opposite concept, while default negation is used to ensure consistency and to handle exceptions to general rules. Exceptions are represented by examples covered by the de nition for a concept that belong to the training set for the opposite concept. Standard Inductive Logic Programming techniques are employed to learn the concept and its opposite. Depending on the adopted technique, we can learn the most general or the least general

InCommonSense - Rethinking Web Search Results The World Wide Web is a rich annotation system which allows people to relate to documents and sites from different perspectives. People describe, comment, relate or mock other Web pages in the context of their document. This richness is currently not reflected in snippets presented by Web search engines, where a search result is represented by the text found in the Web document alone. This paper proposes a new method for representing documents in Web search engines' results. This method is based on recent trends in search engine technology and provides descriptions of the retrieved documents, assembled from people's commentary and annotations on the Web. This paper suggests a new way for automatically retrieving and reusing people's annotations on the Web, incorporating these annotations into a search engine for creating a hybrid directory-search-engine, allowing for both automatic retrieval and on-the-fly human authored summaries.

The Legion System: A Novel Approach to Evolving Heterogeneity for Collective Problem Solving . We investigate the dynamics of agent groups evolved to perform  a collective task, and in which the behavioural heterogeneity of the  group is under evolutionary control. Two task domains are studied: solutions  are evolved for the two tasks using an evolutionary algorithm called  the Legion system. A new metric of heterogeneity is also introduced,  which measures the heterogeneity of any evolved group behaviour. It  was found that the amount of heterogeneity evolved in an agent group  is dependent of the given problem domain: for the rst task, the Legion  system evolved heterogeneous groups; for the second task, primarily homogeneous  groups evolved. We conclude that the proposed system, in  conjunction with the introduced heterogeneity measure, can be used as  a tool for investigating various issues concerning redundancy, robustness  and division of labour in the context of evolutionary approaches to collective  problem solving.  1 Introduction  Investigations into heterogeneous a...

A Collaborative Internet Documents Access Scheme Using Acird In this paper, we present a collaborative intelligent Internet multi-web sites documents search system using ACIRD. ACIRD is a system that automatically learns the classification knowledge from Web pages and applies the knowledge to automatic classification of Web pages to some classes in a class hierarchy. Data mining technique is used to learn the association of terms to discover the hidden semantic connections between terms. With the capabilities of ACIRD, it is straightforward to extend ACIRD to collaborate multi-web site document access. Based on the learned classification knowledge, a collaborative two-phase search engine is proposed, which dispatches queries to distributed Web sites to match documents and presents hierarchically navigable results to the Internet users rather than conventional ranked flat results. 1.

Weight Adjustment Schemes for a Centroid Based Classifier In recent years we have seen a tremendous growth in the volume of text documents available on the Internet, digital  libraries, news sources, and company-wide intra-nets. Automatic text categorization, which is the task of assigning  text documents to pre-specified classes (topics or themes) of documents, is an important task that can help both in  organizing as well as in finding information on these huge resources. Similarity based categorization algorithms such  as k-nearest neighbor, generalized instance set and centroid based classification have been shown to be very effective  in document categorization. A major drawback of these algorithms is that they use all features when computing the  similarities. In many document data sets, only a small number of the total vocabulary may be useful for categorizing  documents. A possible approach to overcome this problem is to learn weights for different features (or words in  document data sets). In this report we present two fast iterativ...

Turning Yahoo into an Automatic Web-Page Classifier . The paper describes an approach to automatic Web-page classification based on the Yahoo hierarchy. Machine learning techniques developed for learning on text data are used here on the hierarchical classification structure. The high number of features is reduced by taking into account the hierarchical structure and using feature subset selection based on the method known from information retrieval. Documents are represented as feature-vectors that include n-grams instead of including only single words (unigrams) as commonly used when learning on text data. Based on the hierarchical structure the problem is divided into subproblems, each representing one on the categories included in the Yahoo hierarchy. The result of learning is a set of independent classifiers, each used to predict the probability that a new example is a member of the corresponding category. Experimental evaluation on real-world data shows that the proposed approach gives good results. For more than a half of testing...

FRP has been used successfully in many reactive programming domains such as animation, robotics, and graphical user interfaces. The success of FRP in these domains encourages us to consider its use in real-time applications, where it is crucial that the cost of running a program be bounded and known before run-time. But previous work on the semantics and implementation of FRP was not explicitly concerned about the issues of cost. In fact, the resource consumption of FRP programs in the current implementation is often hard to predict. As a first step

OMS Rapid Prototyping System for the Development of Object-Oriented Database Application Systems We present an object-oriented data model and system that supports the development of database application systems through a combination of rapid prototyping and refinement. Prototyping is performed on an abstract application model and is independent of any implementation platform -- supporting not only the design stage, but also analysis and requirements modelling. The underlying model, OM, has a two-level structure which reflects the two aspects of object-oriented database application systems -- data modelling and programming. We are therefore able to cleanly integrate ideas from both the database and software engineering communities and achieve compatibility with object models used in both.

Repository Support For Multi-Perspective Requirements Engineering Abstract | Relationships among di erent modeling perspectives have been systematically investigated focusing either on given notations (e.g. UML) or on domain reference models (e.g. ARIS/SAP). In contrast, many successful informal methods for business analysis and requirements engineering (e.g. JAD) emphasize team negotiation, goal orientation and exibility of modeling notations. This paper addresses the question how much formal and computerized support can be provided in such settings without destroying their creative tenor. Our solution is based on a novel modeling language design, M-Telos, that integrates the adaptability and analysis advantages of the logic-based meta modeling language Telos with a module concept covering the structuring mechanisms of scalable software architectures. It comprises four components: (1) A modular conceptual modeling formalism organizes individual perspectives and their interrelationships. (2) Perspective schemata are linked to a conceptual meta meta model of shared domain terms, thus giving the architecture a semantic meaning and enabling adaptability and extensibility of the network of perspectives. (3) Inconsistency management across perspectives is handled in a goal-oriented manner, by formalizing analysis goals as meta rules which are automatically customized to perspective schemata. (4) Continuous incremental maintenance of inconsistency information is provided by exploiting recent view maintenance techniques from deductive databases. The approach has been fully implemented as an extension to the ConceptBase meta database management system and is currently experimentally applied in the context of business analysis and data warehouse design.

Automated Knowledge and Information Fusion from multiple text-based sources using Formal Concept Analysis This report explores the space of this problem and develops some steps towards its solutions. Our experience with knowledge representation languages and dynamic hyperlinking of HTML documents using conceptual graphs seems complementary to the multiple source knowledge fusion task [40]. The reasons are that conceptual graphs are based on lexical, hierarchically structured ontologies of semantically related terms and these structures lend themselves to traditional information retrival engines, at least so far as term extraction from text is concerned. Furthermore, conceptual graphs provide for typical and necessary conditions, logical inference and term signatures that aid with disambiguiation of semantic intent. Conceptual graphs also permit knowledge fusion by way of the maximal join operation. Conceptual graphs are not without their research challenges however. Who or what can automatically generate the CGs and how the approach scales to real-world  multiple source fusion are open questions. To address the first of these issues. There are two schools of thought on who or what generates the CGs needed for knowledge fusion from multiple sources. The first of these is that index expressions generated by a meta-level information retrival engine called the Hyperindex Browser (the HiB) [5, 6, 7, 4] can be used to automatically generate knowledge annotations as input to an inference engine (such as the one used by our research group's WebKB software [38, 39, 40]). The idea here is that we can efficiently extract and fuse knowledge structures from example documents to construct a knowledge exemplar and that these exemplars are subsequently used to compute the closure of the knowledge base and generate pattern recognition classifiers (see Figure 1.1).

Unifying Class-Based Representation Formalisms The notion of class is ubiquitous in computer science and is central in many formalisms for the representation of structured knowledge used both in knowledge representation and in databases. In this paper we study the basic issues underlying such representation formalisms and single out both their common characteristics and their distinguishing features. Such investigation leads us to propose a unifying framework in which we are able to capture the fundamental aspects of several representation languages used in different contexts. The proposed formalism is expressed in the style of description logics, which have been introduced in knowledge representation as a means to provide a semantically well-founded basis for the structural aspects of knowledge representation systems. The description logic considered in this paper is a subset of first order logic with nice computational characteristics. It is quite expressive and features a novel combination of constructs that has not been studied before. The distinguishing constructs are number restrictions, which generalize existence and functional dependencies, inverse roles, which allow one to refer to the inverse of a relationship, and possibly cyclic assertions, which are necessary for capturing real world

Rule Discovery From Time Series We consider the problem of finding rules relating patterns  in a time series to other patterns in that series,  or patterns in one series to patterns in another series.  A simple example is a rule such as "a period  of low telephone call activity is usually followed by a  sharp rise in call volume". Examples of rules relating  two or more time series are "if the Microsoft stock  price goes up and Intel falls, then IBM goes up the  next day," and "if Microsoft goes up strongly for one  day, then declines strongly on the next day, and on  the same days Intel stays about level, then IBM stays  about level." Our emphasis is in the discovery of local  patterns in multivariate time series, in contrast to traditional  time series analysis which largely focuses on  global models.

In this paper, we present an n-gram based model to utilize path profiles of users from very large data sets to predict the users' future requests. Since this is a prediction system, we cannot measure the recall in a traditional sense.

Three Companions for First Order Data Mining . Three companion systems, Claudien, ICL and Tilde, are presented. They use a common representation for examples and hypotheses: each example is represented by a relational database. This contrasts with the classical inductive logic programming systems such as Progol  and Foil. It is argued that this representation is closer to attribute value learning and hence more natural. Furthermore, the three systems can be considered first order upgrades of typical data mining systems, which induce association rules, classification rules or decision trees respectively. 1 Introduction  Typical data mining algorithms employ a limited attribute value representation, where each example consists of a single tuple in a relational database. This representation is inadequate for problem-domains that require reasoning about the structure of the domain, such as e.g. in bio-chemistry [7], natural language processing [14],. . .

Top N optimization issues in MM databases Introduction  In multi media (MM) DBMSs the usual way of operation in case of a MM retrieval query is to compute some ranking based on statistics and distances in feature spaces. The MM objects are then sorted by descending relevance relative to the given query. Since users are limited in their capabilities of reviewing all objects in that ranked list only a reasonable top of say N objects is returned.  However, this can turn out to be a quite time consuming process. The first reason is that the number of objects (i.e. documents) in the DBMS is usually very large (10  6  or even more). From the information retrieval field it is known that usually half of all objects (e.g. documents) contains at least one query term; so, even considering only these objects might be very time consuming. The same may hold for MM in general.  The problem of top N MM query optimization is to find techniques to limit the set of objects taken into consideration during the

Super Logic Programs Recently, considerable interest and research e#ort has been given to the problem of finding a suitable extension of the logic programming paradigm beyond the class of normal logic programs. In order to demonstrate that a class of programs can be justifiably called an extension of logic programs one should be able to argue that:  .  the proposed syntax of such programs resembles the syntax of logic programs but it applies to a significantly broader class of programs;  .  the proposed semantics of such programs constitutes an intuitively natural extension of the semantics of normal logic programs;  .  there exists a reasonably simple procedural mechanism allowing, at least in principle, to compute the semantics;  .  the proposed class of programs and their semantics is a special case of a more general non-monotonic formalism which clearly links it to other well-established non-monotonic formalisms. In this paper we propose a specific class of extended logic programs which will be (modestly) called super logic programs or just super-programs. We will argue that the class of super-programs satisfies all of the above conditions, and, in addition, is su#ciently flexible to allow various application-dependent extensions and modifications. We also provide a brief description of a Prolog implementation of a query-answering interpreter for the class of super-programs which is available via FTP and WWW.

A Theory of Proximity Based Clustering: Structure Detection by Optimization In this paper, a systematic optimization approach for clustering proximity or similarity data is developed. Starting from fundamental invariance and robustness properties, a set of axioms is proposed and discussed to distinguish different cluster compactness and separation criteria. The approach covers the case of sparse proximity matrices, and is extended to nested partitionings for hierarchical data clustering. To solve the associated optimization problems, a rigorous mathematical framework for deterministic annealing and mean--field approximation is presented. Efficient optimization heuristics are derived in a canonical way, which also clarifies the relation to stochastic optimization by Gibbs sampling. Similarity-based clustering techniques have a broad range of possible applications in computer vision, pattern recognition, and data analysis.

Grouplab at SkiGraph Collaboration among distributed workgroup members is hampered by the lack of good tools to support informal interactions. These tools either fail to provide teleawareness or enable smooth transitions into and out of informal interactions. Video media spaces---always-on video links---have been proposed as a solution to this problem. However, the "always-on" nature of video media spaces results in a conflict between the desire to provide awareness and the need to preserve privacy.

Reasoning over Conceptual Schemas and Queries in Temporal Databases This paper introduces a new logical formalism,  intended for temporal conceptual modelling,  as a natural combination of the wellknown  description logic DLR and pointbased  linear temporal logic with Since and  Until. The expressive power of the resulting   DLRUS logic is illustrated by providing  a systematic formalisation of the most important  temporal entity-relationship data models  appeared in the literature. We define  a query language (where queries are nonrecursive  Datalog programs and atoms are  complex DLRUS expressions) and investigate  the problem of checking query containment  under the constraints defined by  DLRUS conceptual schemas, as well as the  problems of schema satisfiability and logical  implication. Although it is shown that reasoning  in full DLRUS is undecidable, we  identify the decidable (in a sense, maximal)  fragment DLR  US  by allowing applications  of temporal operators to formulas and entities  only (but not to relation expressions). We obtain  the following hierarchy of complexity results:  (a) reasoning in DLR US with atomic  formulas is EXPTIME-complete, (b) satisfiability  and logical implication of arbitrary  DLR US formulas is EXPSPACE-complete,  and (c) the problem of checking query containment  of non-recursive Datalog queries under   DLR US constraints is decidable in 2EXPTIME.

Lessons Learned from the Scientist's Expert Assistant Project During the past two years, the Scientist's Expert Assistant (SEA) team has been prototyping proposal development tools for the Hubble Space Telescope in an effort to demonstrate the role of software in reducing support costs for the Next Generation Space Telescope (NGST). This effort has been a success. The Hubble Space Telescope has adopted two SEA prototype tools, the Exposure Time Calculator and Visual Target Tuner, for operational use. The Space Telescope Science Institute is building a new set of observing tools based on SEA technology. These tools will hopefully be a foundation that is easily adaptable to other observatories including NGST.  The SEA project has aggressively pursued the latest software technologies including Java, distributed computing, XML, Web distribution, and expert systems. Some technology experiments proved to be dead ends, while other technologies were unexpectedly beneficial. We have also worked with other projects to foster collaboration between the vario...

Indexing Spatio-Temporal Data Warehouses Spatio-temporal databases store information about the positions of individual objects over time. In many applications however, such as traffic supervision or mobile communication systems, only summarized data, like the average number of cars in an area for a specific period, or phones serviced by a cell each day, is required. Although this information can be obtained from operational databases, its computation is expensive, rendering online processing inapplicable. A vital solution is the construction of a spatiotemporal data warehouse. In this paper, we describe a framework for supporting OLAP operations over spatiotemporal data. We argue that the spatial and temporal dimensions should be modeled as a combined dimension on the data cube and present data structures, which integrate spatiotemporal indexing with pre-aggregation. While the well-known materialization techniques require a-priori knowledge of the grouping hierarchy, we develop methods that utilize the proposed structures for efficient execution of ad-hoc group-bys. Our techniques can be used for both static and dynamic dimensions.  1.

Transductive Inference for Text Classification using Support Vector Machines This paper introduces Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVMs) for text classification.  While regular Support Vector Machines  (SVMs) try to induce a general decision  function for a learning task, Transductive  Support Vector Machines take into account  a particular test set and try to minimize  misclassifications of just those particular  examples. The paper presents an analysis  of why TSVMs are well suited for text  classification. These theoretical findings are  supported by experiments on three test collections.  The experiments show substantial  improvements over inductive methods, especially  for small training sets, cutting the number  of labeled training examples down to a  twentieth on some tasks. This work also proposes  an algorithm for training TSVMs efficiently,  handling 10,000 examples and more.

A Practical, Robust Method for Generating Variable Range Tables In optimized programs the location in which the current value of a single source variable may reside typically varies as the computation progresses. A debugger for optimized code needs to know all of the locations -- both registers and memory addresses -- in which a variable resides, and which locations are valid for which portions of the computation. Determining this information is known as the data location problem [3, 7]. Because optimizations frequently move variables around (between registers and memory or from one register to another) the compiler must build a table to keep track of this information. Such a table is known as a variable range table [3]. Once a variable range table has been constructed, finding a variable's current location reduces to the simple task of looking up the appropriate entry in the table.  The difficulty lies in collecting the data for building the table. Previous methods for collecting this data depend on which optimizations the compiler performs and ho...

Computational Intelligence Methods and Data Understanding Abstract. Experts in machine learning and fuzzy system frequently identify understanding the data with the use of logical rules. Reasons for inadequacy of crisp and fuzzy rule-based explanations are presented. An approach based on analysis of probabilities of classification p(Ci|X;œÅ) as a function of the size of the neighborhood œÅ of the given case X is presented. Probabilities are evaluated using Monte Carlo sampling or ‚Äì for some models ‚Äì using analytical formulas. Coupled with topographically correct visualization of the data in this neighborhood this approach, applicable to any classifiers, gives in many cases a better evaluation of the new data than rule-based systems. Two real life examples of such interpretation are presented. 1 Introduction. Classification and prediction are the two most common applications of computational intelligence (CI) methods, i.e. methods designed for solving problems that are effectively non-algorithmic. Although sometimes classification by a black box is sufficient ‚Äì if it is reliable ‚Äì domain experts use software to help them to understand

Practical Dependency Analysis through a Share Quotient Def , the domain of definite Boolean functions, expresses (sure) dependencies between the program variables of, say, a constraint program. The domain Share, on the other hand, captures the (possible) variable sharing between the variables of a logic program. The connection between these domains has been explored in the domain comparison, quotienting and decomposition literature. We develop this link further and show how the meet (as well as the join) of Def can be modelled with efficient (quadratic) operations on Share. We show how the connection leads to an attractive way of constructing a dependency analysis and how widening can make the approach practical.

A Cubist approach to Object Recognition We describe an appearance-based object recognition system using a keyed, multi-level context representation reminiscent of certain aspects of cubist art. Specifically, we utilize distinctive intermediatelevel features in this case automatically extracted 2-D boundary fragments,, as keys, which are then verified within a local context, and assembled within a loose global context to evoke an overall percept.

Enhancing the Expressive Power of the U-Datalog Language U-Datalog has been developed with the aim of providing a set-oriented logical update language, guaranteeing update parallelism in the context of a Datalog-like language. In U-Datalog, updates are expressed by introducing constraints (+p(X), to denote insertion, and p(X), to denote deletion) inside Datalog rules. A U-Datalog program can be interpreted as a CLP program. In this framework, a set of updates (constraints) is satisable if it does not represent an inconsistent theory, that is, it does not require the insertion and the deletion of the same fact. This approach resembles a very simple form of negation. However, on the other hand, U-Datalog does not provide any mechanism to explicitly deal with negative information, resulting in a language with limited expressive power. In this paper, we provide a semantics, based on stratication, handling the use of negated atoms in U-Datalog programs and we show which problems arise in dening a compositional semantics.

An Instructor's Assistant for Team-Training in dynamic multi-agent virtual worlds Teams of people operating in highly dynamic, multi-agent environments must learn to deal with rapid and unpredictable turns of events. Simulation-based training environments inhabited by synthetic agents can be effective in providing realistic but safe settings in which to develop the skills these environments require. However such training environments present a problem for the instructor who must evaluate and control rapidly evolving training sessions. We address the instructors' problem with a pedagogical agent called the PuppetMaster. The PuppetMaster manages a network of spy agents that report on the activities in the simulation in order to provide the instructor with an interpretation and situation-specific analysis of student behavior. The approach used to model student teams is to structure the state space into an abstract situation-based model of behavior that supports interpretation in the face of missing information about agent's actions and goals.

Query Processing in a Device Database System Data Types Today's object-relational and object-oriented databases support Abstract Data Type (ADT) objects that are single attribute values encapsulating a collection of related data. The critical feature of an ADT that makes it suitable for representing devices is encapsulation. % Note that there are natural parallels between devices and ADTs. Both ADTs and devices provide controlled access to encapsulated data and functionality through a well-defined interface. We build upon this observation by modeling each type of device in the network as an ADT in the database -- an actual ADT object in the database corresponds then to a physical device in the real world. The public interface of the ADT corresponds to the functionality supported by the device. Methods on the device are executed by sending requests to the device, which evaluates the methods and answers with return values. Differences between the different device types are reflected by differences between the abstract dat...

AgentSpeak(L): BDI Agents speak out in a logical computable language Abstract. Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents have been investigated by many researchers from both a theoretical specification perspectiveand a practical design perspective. However, there still remains a large gap between theory and practice. The main reason for this has been the complexity of theorem-proving or modelchecking in these expressive specification logics. Hence, the implemented BDI systems have tended to use the three major attitudes as data structures, rather than as modal operators. In this paper, we provide an alternative formalization of BDI agents by providing an operational and proof-theoretic semantics of a language AgentSpeak(L). This language can be viewed as an abstraction of one of the implemented BDI systems (i.e., PRS) and allows agent programs to be written and interpreted in a manner similar to that of horn-clause logic programs. We show how to perform derivations in this logic using a simple example. These derivations can then be used to prove the properties satisfied by BDI agents. 1

Evaluation of Eye Gaze Interaction Eye gaze interaction can provide a convenient and natural addition to user-computer dialogues. We have previously reported on our interaction techniques using eye gaze [10]. While our techniques seemed useful in demonstration, we now investigate their strengths and weaknesses in a controlled setting. In this paper, we present two experiments that compare an interaction technique we developed for object selection based on a where a person is looking with the most commonly used selection method using a mouse. We find that our eye gaze interaction technique is faster than selection with a mouse. The results show that our algorithm, which makes use of knowledge about how the eyes behave, preserves the natural quickness of the eye. Eye gaze interaction is a reasonable addition to computer interaction and is convenient in situations where it is important to use the hands for other tasks. It is particularly beneficial for the larger screen workspaces and virtual environments of the future, and it will become increasingly practical as eye tracker technology matures.

The Dynamics of Database Views . The dynamics of relational database can be specified by means of Reiter's formalism based on the situation calculus. The specification of transaction based database updates is given in terms of Successor State Axioms (SSAs) for the base tables of the database. These axioms completely describe the contents of the tables at an arbitrary state of the database that is generated by the execution of a legal primitive transaction, and thus solve the frame problem for databases. In this paper we show how to derive action--effect based SSAs for views from the SSAs for the base tables. We prove consistency properties for those axioms. In addition, we establish the relationship between the derived SSA and the view definition as a static integrity constraint of the database. We give applications of the derived SSAs to the problems of view maintenance, and checking, proving, and enforcement of integrity constraints. 1 Introduction  The situation calculus (SC) [MH1] is a family of many sorted lang...

Techniques for Specialized Search Engines It is emerging that it is very difficult for the major search engines to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date search service of the Web. Even the largest search engines index only a small proportion of static Web pages and do not search the Web' s backend databases that are estimated to be 500 times larger than the static Web. The scale of such searching introduces both technical and economic problems. What is more, in many cases users are not able to retrieve the information they desire because of the simple and generic search interface provided by the major search engines. A necessary response to these search problems is the creation of specialized search engines. These search engines search just for information in a particular topic or category on the Web. Such search engines will have smaller and more manageable indexes and have a powerful domainspecific search interface. This paper discusses the issues in this area and gives an overview of the techniques for building specialized search engines.

Examining Locally Varying Weights for Nearest Neighbor Algorithms . Previous work on feature weighting for case-based learning algorithms has tended to use either global weights or weights that vary over extremely local regions of the case space. This paper examines the use of coarsely local weighting schemes, where feature weights are allowed to vary but are identical for groups or clusters of cases. We present a new technique, called class distribution weighting (CDW), that allows weights to vary at the class level. We further extend CDW into a family of related techniques that exhibit varying degrees of locality, from global to local. The class distribution techniques are then applied to a set of eleven concept learning tasks. We find that one or more of the CDW variants significantly improves classification accuracy for nine of the eleven tasks. In addition, we find that the relative importance of classes, features, and feature values in a particular domain determines which variant is most successful. 1 Introduction  The k-nearest-neighbor (k-NN)...

Bootstrapping an Ontology-based Information Extraction System Automatic intelligent web exploration will benefit from shallow information extraction techniques if the latter can be brought to work within many different domains. The major bottleneck for this, however, lies in the so far difficult and expensive modeling of lexical knowledge, extraction rules, and an ontology that together define the information extraction system. In this paper we present a bootstrapping approach that allows for the fast creation of an ontology-based information extracting system relying on several basic components, viz. a core information extraction system, an ontology engineering environment and an inference engine.

A Model Independent Source Code Repository Software repositories, used to support program development and maintenance, invariably require an abstract model of the source code. This requirement restricts the repository user to the analyses and queries supported by the data model of the repository.

Source code is treated as text, augmented with supplementary syntactic and semantic information.

Data Mining Approaches for Intrusion Detection In this paper we discuss our research in developing general and systematic methods for intrusion detection. The key ideas are to use data mining techniques to discover consistent and useful patterns of system features that describe program and user behavior, and use the set of relevant system features to compute (inductively learned) classifiers that can recognize anomalies and known intrusions. Using experiments on the sendmail system call data and the network tcpdump data, we demonstrate that we can construct concise and accurate classifiers to detect anomalies. We provide an overview on two general data mining algorithms that we have implemented: the association rules algorithm and the frequent episodes algorithm. These algorithms can be used to compute the intra- and inter- audit record patterns, which are essential in describing program or user behavior. The discovered patterns can guide the audit data gathering process and facilitate feature selection. To meet the challenges of both efficient learning (mining) and real-time detection, we propose an agent-based architecture for intrusion detection systems where the learning agents continuously compute and provide the updated (detection) models to the detection agents.

Rule Induction of Computer Events Introduction  Monitoring systems are able to capture an assortment of different events from a network environment. A single event signals an abnormal situation on either one host, e.g., "cpu utilization is above a critical threshold", or the network, e.g., "communication link is down". A monitoring system can capture thousands of events in a short time period (several days); applying data analysis techniques (e.g., machine-learning, data-mining) on those events may reveal useful patterns characterizing a network problem. Data analysis techniques have proved useful in the area of network fault management.  In this paper we consider the following scenario. A computer network is under continuous monitoring; a user is interested in identifying what triggers a specific kind of events, which we refer to as target events. The user would like to know what events correlate to each target event within a fixed time window. We describe a data-mining technique that takes as input

Learning Cases to Resolve Conflicts and Improve Group Behavior Groups of agents following fixed behavioral rules can be limited in performance and efficiency. Adaptability and flexibility are key components of intelligent behavior which allow agent groups to improve performance in a given domain using prior problem solving experience. We motivate the usefulness of individual learning by group members in the context of overall group behavior. In particular, we propose a framework in which individual group members learn cases to improve their model of other group members. We use a testbed problem from the distributed AI literature to show that simultaneous learning by group members can lead to significant improvement in group performance and efficiency over agent groups following static behavioral rules.

Inverted Files Versus Signature Files for Text Indexing Two well-known indexing methods are inverted files and signature files. We have undertaken a detailed comparison of these two approaches in the context of text indexing, paying particular attention to query evaluation speed and space requirements. We have examined their relative performance using both experimentation and a refined approach to modeling of signature files, and demonstrate that inverted files are distinctly superior to signature files. Not only can inverted files be used to evaluate typical queries in less time than can signature files, but inverted files require less space and provide greater functionality. Our results also show that a synthetic text database can provide a realistic indication of the behavior of an actual text database. The tools used to generate the synthetic database have been made publicly available.

Fast Supervised Dimensionality Reduction Algorithm with Applications to Document Categorization & Retrieval Retrieval techniques based on dimensionality reduction, such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), have been shown to improve the quality of the information being retrieved by capturing the latent meaning of the words present in the documents. Unfortunately, the high computational and memory requirements of LSI and its inability to compute an effective dimensionality reduction in a supervised setting limits its applicability. In this paper we present a fast supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm that is derived from the recently developed cluster-based unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithms. We experimentally evaluate the quality of the lower dimensional spaces both in the context of document categorization and improvements in retrieval performance on a variety of different document collections.

A-Teams are constructed from memories that store solutions and agents that work on those solutions. ATeams are open to the addition of new memories as well as of new agents. Sets of memories and agents can also be combined in different ways to create a variety of customized A-Teams. As new memories and agents are created, they can be added to existing repositories and reused for future applications. The automatic construction of problem-specific custom A-Teams from repositories of components has been a long standing goal of research in A-Teams. Current guidelines for A-Team construction requir...

Data Quality in e-Business Applications In e-Business scenarios, an evaluation of the quality of exchanged  data is essential for developing service-based applications and  correctly performing cooperative activities. Data of low quality can spread  all over the cooperative system, but at the same time, improvement can  be based on comparing data, correcting them and disseminating high  quality data. In this paper, an XML-based broker service for managing  data quality in cooperative systems is presented, which selects the best  available data from different services. Such a broker also supports data  quality improvements based on feedbacks to source services.

Coordination Infrastructure for Virtual Enterprises Virtual Enterprises (VE) and Workflow Management Systems (WFMS) require deployable and flexible infrastructures, promoting the integration of heterogenous resources and services, as well as the development of new VE's business processes in terms of workflow (WF) rules coordinating the activities of VE's component enterprises. In this paper, we argue that a suitable general-purpose coordination infrastructure may well fit the needs of VE management in a highly dynamic and unpredictable environment like the Internet, by providing engineers with the abstractions and run-time support to address heterogeneity of different sorts, and to represent WF rules as coordination laws. We discuss the requirements for VE infrastructures, and suggest why VE management and WFMS may be seen as coordination problems. Then, we introduce the TuCSoN coordination model and technology, and show, both in principle and in a simple case study, how such a coordination infrastructure can support the design and deve...

Processing Fuzzy Spatial Queries: A Configuration Similarity Approach . Increasing interest for configuration similarity is currently developing in the context of Digital Libraries, Spatial Databases and Geographical Information Systems. The corresponding queries retrieve all database configurations that match an input description (e.g., "find all configurations where an object x 0 is about 5km northeast of another x 1 , which, in turn, is inside object x 2 "). This paper introduces a framework for configuration similarity that takes into account all major types of spatial constraints (topological, direction, distance). We define appropriate fuzzy similarity measures for each type of constraint to provide flexibility and allow the system to capture real-life needs. Then we apply pre-processing techniques to explicate constraints in the query, and present algorithms that effectively solve the problem. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the applicability of our approach to images and queries of considerable size. 1. INTRODUCTION As opposed to visu...

An Integrated Secure Web Architecture For Protected Mobile Code Distribution : IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) protection is one of the key elements to be considered in the development of mobile code technologies (applets, agents, etc.) due to the mobile nature of this kind of software and the power of servers. The absence of protection would increase the risk of piracy to such a level that the economy of this sector would be weakened, perhaps even destroyed. FILIGRANE (FlexIbLe IPR for Software AGent ReliANcE) Framework  Complementary to the legal provisions (anti-piracy laws), IPR protection is one of the absolute elements in the development of these new markets. In the course of ESPRIT project FILIGRANE (FlexIbLe IPR for Software AGent ReliANcE), we developed an integrated Web architecture and associated security framework and protocol for the trading of mobile code in Internet.

Learning to Order Things wcohen,schapire,singer¬° There are many applications in which it is desirable to order rather than classify instances. Here we consider the problem of learning how to order, given feedback in the form of preference judgments, i.e., statements to the effect that one instance should be ranked ahead of another. We outline a two-stage approach in which one first learns by conventional means a preference function, of the form PREF¬¢¬§¬£¬¶¬•¬®¬ßÔøΩ ¬©, which indicates whether it is advisable to rank ¬£ before ¬ß. New instances are then ordered so as to maximize agreements with the learned preference function. We show that the problem of finding the ordering that agrees best with a preference function is NP-complete, even under very restrictive assumptions. Nevertheless, we describe a simple greedy algorithm that is guaranteed to find a good approximation. We then discuss an on-line learning algorithm, based on the ‚ÄúHedge ‚Äù algorithm, for finding a good linear combination of ranking ‚Äúexperts.‚Äù We use the ordering algorithm combined with the on-line learning algorithm to find a combination of ‚Äúsearch experts, ‚Äù each of which is a domain-specific query expansion strategy for a WWW search engine, and present experimental results that demonstrate the merits of our approach. 1

Querying XML Documents in Xyleme this paper on query processing. The query language supporting Xyleme graphical user interface is an extension of OQL [6, 10] and provides a mix of database and information retrieval characteristics. It is consistent with the requirements published by the W3C XML Query Working Group [20] and similar to many languages proposed by the database community for text or semistructured databases [1, 5, 7, 11]. Still, due to the fact that we are considering millions of documents, query processing acquires in Xyleme a truly distinct flavor.

Searching People on the Web According to Their Interests Due to lack of structural data and information explosion on the World Wide Web (WWW), searching for useful information is becoming increasingly a difficult task. Traditional search engines on the Web render some form of assistance, but perform sub-optimally when dealing with context sensitive queries. To overcome this, niche search engines serving specific Web communities evolved. These engines index only pages of high quality and relevance to a specific domain and make use of context information for searching. This poster presents BullsI Search (publicly available at http://dm2.comp.nus.edu.sg), a fielded domain specific search engine that helps Web users locate computer science faculty members' homepages and email addresses by specifying a research interest, teaching interest or name. The system is able to automatically extract and index research interests, teaching interests, owners' email addresses and names from a set of discovered homepages. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed algorithms are very accurate and are independent of structures in different homepages.

Appearance-Based Place Recognition for Topological Localization This paper presents a new appearance-based place recognition system for topological localization. The method uses a panoramic vision system to sense the environment. Color images are classified in real-time based on nearest-neighbor learning, image histogram matching, and a simple voting scheme. The system has been evaluated with eight cross-sequence tests in four unmodified environments, three indoors and one outdoors. In all eight cases, the system successfully tracked the mobile robot's position. The system correctly classified between 87% and 98% of the input color images. For the remaining images, the system was either momentarily confused or uncertain, but never classified an image incorrectly. 1. INTRODUCTION Localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics.

Generating User Interface Code in a Model Based User Interface Development Environment Declarative models play an important role in most software design activities, by allowing designs to be constructed that selectively abstract over complex implementation details. In the user interface setting, Model-Based User Interface Development Environments (MB-UIDEs) provide a context within which declarative models can be constructed and related, as part of the interface design process. However, such declarative models are not usually directly executable, and may be difficult to relate to existing software components. It is therefore important that MB-UIDEs both fit in well with existing software architectures and standards, and provide an effective route from declarative interface specification to running user interfaces. This paper describes how user interface software is generated from declarative descriptions in the Teallach MB-UIDE. Distinctive features of Teallach include its open architecture, which connects directly to existing applications and widget sets, and the genera...

A Multi-Agent System for Automated Genomic Annotation Massive amounts of raw data are currently being generated by biologists while sequencing organisms. Outside of the largest, high-profile projects such as the Human Genome Project, most of this raw data must be analyzed through the piecemeal application of various computer programs and searches of various public web databases. Due to the inexperience and lack of training, both the raw data and any valuable derived knowledge will remain generally unavailable except in published textual forms. Multi-agent information gathering systems have a lot to contribute to these efforts, even at the current state of the art. We have used DECAF, a multi-agent system toolkit based on RETSINA and TAEMS, to construct a prototype multi-agent system for automated annotation and database storage of sequencing data for herpes viruses. The resulting system eliminates tedious and always out-of-date hand analyses, makes the data and annotations available for other researchers (or agent systems), and provides a level of query processing beyond even some high-profile web sites.

Learning Concepts by Interaction This paper presents a theory of how robots may learn  concepts by interacting with their environment in an  unsupervised way. First, categories of activities are learned,  then abstractions over those categories result in concepts.  The meanings of concepts are discussed. Robotic systems  that learn categories of activities and concepts are presented.  Introduction  If machines could acquire conceptual knowledge with the same facility as humans, then AI would be much better off. There's no denying the dream of a machine that knows roughly what we know, organized roughly as we organize it, with roughly the same values and motives as we have. It makes sense, then, to ask how this knowledge is acquired by humans and how might it be acquired by machines.  I focus on the origins of conceptual knowledge, the earliest distinctions and classes, the first efforts to carve the world at its joints. One reason is just the desire to get to the bottom of, or in this case the beginning of, anything. ...

Contractual Agent Societies: Negotiated shared context and social control in open multi-agent systems Information systems for supporting the fluid organizations of the 21  st  century must be correspondingly open and agile, able to automatically configure themselves out of heterogeneous system components, accommodate the dynamic exit and entry of hitherto unknown participants and maintain system stability in the face of limited trust. This paper introduces the concept of Contractual Agent Societies (CAS) as a metaphor for building such open information systems. CAS are open information systems where independently developed agents configure themselves automatically through a set of dynamically negotiated social contracts. Social contracts define the shared context of agent interactions, including ontologies, joint beliefs, joint goals, normative behaviors, etc. In addition, they specify classes of associated exceptions (deviations from ideal behavior) together with associated prevention and resolution mechanisms.

Relational Representations that Facilitate Learning Given a collection of objects in the world,  along with some relations that hold among  them, a fundamental problem is how to learn  denitions of some relations and concepts of  interest in terms of the given relations. These  denitions might be quite complex and, inevitably,  might require the use of quanti-  ed expressions. Attempts to use rst order  languages for these purposes are hampered  by the fact that relational inference is  intractable and, consequently, so is the problem  of learning relational denitions.  This work develops an expressive relational  representation language that allows the use  of propositional learning algorithms when  learning relational denitions.  The representation serves as an intermediate  level between a raw description of observations  in the world and a propositional learning  system that attempts to learn denitions  for concepts and relations. It allows for hierarchical  composition of relational expressions  that can be evaluated ecientl...

Sensory-Motor Primitives as a Basis for Imitation: Linking Perception to Action and Biology to Robotics ing away from the specific coding of the spinal fields, the examples from neurobiology provide the framework for a motor control system based on a small number of additive primitives (or basis behaviors) sufficient for a rich output movement repertoire. Our previous work (Matari'c 1995, Matari'c 1997), inspired by the same biological results, has successfully applied the idea of basis behaviors to control of mobile robots 6  by fitting it directly into the modular behavior-based control paradigm. Applictions of schema theory (Arbib 1992) to behavior-based mobile robots (Arkin 1987) have employed a similar notion of composable behaviors, stemming from foundations in neuroscience (Arbib 1981, Arbib 1989).

Integration of Heterogeneous Databases Without Common Domains Using Queries Based on Textual Similarity Most databases contain "name constants" like course numbers, personal names, and place names that correspond to entities in the real world. Previous work in integration of heterogeneous databases has assumed that local name constants can be mapped into an appropriate global domain by normalization. However, in many cases, this assumption does not hold; determining if two name constants should be considered identical can require detailed knowledge of the world, the purpose of the user's query, or both. In this paper, we reject the assumption that global domains can be easily constructed, and assume instead that the names are given in natural language text. We then propose a logic called WHIRL which reasons explicitly about the similarity of local names, as measured using the vector-space model commonly adopted in statistical information retrieval. We describe an efficient implementation of WHIRL and evaluate it experimentally on data extracted from the World Wide Web. We show that WHIR...

Applications of Quick-Combine for Ranked Query Models In digital libraries queries are often based on the similarity of objects, using several feature attributes like colors, texture or full-text searches. Such multi-feature queries return a ranked result set instead of exact matches. Recently we presented a new algorithm called Quick-Combine [5] for combining multi-feature result lists, guaranteeing the correct retrieval of the k top-ranked results. As benchmarks on practical data promise that we can dramatically improve performance, we want to discuss interesting applications of Quick-Combine in different areas. The applications for the optimization in ranked query models are manifold. Generally speaking we believe that all kinds of federated searches can be supported like e.g. content-based retrieval, knowledge management systems or multi-classifier combination.

Efficient Phrase Querying with an Auxiliary Index Search engines need to evaluate queries extremely fast, a challenging task given the vast quantities of data being indexed. A significant proportion of the queries posed to search engines involve phrases. In this paper we consider how phrase queries can be efficiently supported with low disk overheads. Previous research has shown that phrase queries can be rapidly evaluated using nextword indexes, but these indexes are twice as large as conventional inverted files. We propose a combination of nextword indexes with inverted files as a solution to this problem. Our experiments show that combined use of an auxiliary nextword index and a conventional inverted file allow evaluation of phrase queries in half the time required to evaluate such queries with an inverted file alone, and the space overhead is only 10% of the size of the inverted file. Further time savings are available with only slight increases in disk requirements.

A Randomized Approach to Planning Biped Locomotion with Prescribed Motions In this paper, we present a new scheme for planning a natural-looking locomotion of a human-like biped figure. Given start and goal positions in a virtual environment, our scheme finds a sequence of motions to move from the start position to the goal using a set of prescribed, live-captured motion clips. Our scheme consists of three parts: roadmap construction, roadmap search, and motion generation. We randomly sample a set of valid configurations of the biped figure for the environment to construct a directed graph, called a roadmap, that guides the locomotion of the figure. Every edge of the roadmap is attached with a live-captured motion clip. Traversing the roadmap, we obtain the sequence of footprints and that of motion clips. We finally adapt the motion sequence to the constraints specified by the footprint sequence to obtain the locomotion.

Recognition of Partially Occluded and/or Imprecisely Localized Faces Using a Probabilistic Approach New face recognition approaches are needed, because although much progress has been recently achieved in the field (e.g. within the eigenspace domain), still many problems are to be robustly solved. Two of these problems are occlusions and the imprecise localization of faces (which ultimately imply a failure in identification) . While little has been done to account for the first problem, almost nothing has been proposed to account for the second. This paper presents a probabilistic approach that attempts to solve both problems while using an eigenspace representation. To resolve the localization problem, we need to find the subspace (within the feature space, e.g. eigenspace) that represents this error for each of the training image. To resolve the occlusion problem, each face is divided into n local regions which are analyzed in isolation. In contrast with other previous approaches, where a simple voting space is used, we present a probabilistic method that analyzes how "good" a loca...

Structuring and Querying the Web through Graph-Oriented Languages . In order to pose effective queries to Web sites, some form of site data model must be implicitly or explicitly shared by users. Many approaches try to compensate for the lack of such a common model by considering the hypertextual structure of Web sites; unfortunately, this structure has usually little to do with data semantics. In this paper a different technique is proposed that allows for both navigational and data model description of Web sites, while allowing for graphical queries. The data model is based on WGlog, a description and query language based on the graph-oriented object database model of GOOD [Gys94] and G-log [Par95] allowing description of data manipulation primitives via graph transformations. WG-log description of the navigational part of a Web site schema is lexically based on standard hypermedia design languages, thus allowing for easy schema generation by current hypermedia authoring environments.

Software Fault Tree and Colored Petri Net Based Specification, Design and Implementation of Agent-Based Intrusion Detection Systems The integration of Software Fault Tree (SFT) which describes intrusions and Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) which specifies design, is examined for an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The IDS under development is a collection of mobile agents that detect, classify, and correlate system and network activities. Software Fault Trees (SFTs), augmented with nodes that describe trust, temporal, and contextual relationships, are used to describe intrusions. CPNs for intrusion detection are built using CPN templates created from the augmented SFTs. Hierarchical CPNs are created to detect critical stages of intrusions. The agent-based implementation of the IDS is then constructed from the CPNs. Examples of intrusions and descriptions of the prototype implementation are used to demonstrate how the CPN approach has been used in development of the IDS. The main contribution of this paper is an approach to systematic specification, design, and implementation of an IDS. Innovations include (1) using stages of intrusions to structure the specification and design of the IDS, (2) augmentation of SFT with trust, temporal, and contextual nodes to model intrusions, (3) algorithmic construction of CPNs from augmented SFT, and (4) generation of mobile agents from CPNs. 1

On Bounding-Schemas for LDAP Directories . As our world gets more networked, ever increasing amounts  of information are being stored in LDAP directories. While LDAP directories  have considerable flexibility in the modeling and retrieval of  information for network applications, the notion of schema they provide  for enabling consistent and coherent representation of directory information  is rather weak. In this paper, we propose an expressive notion  of bounding-schemas for LDAP directories, and illustrate their practical  utility. Bounding-schemas are based on lower bound and upper bound  specifications for the content and structure of an LDAP directory. Given  a bounding-schema specification, we present algorithms to efficiently determine:  (i) if an LDAP directory is legal w.r.t. the bounding-schema,  and (ii) if directory insertions and deletions preserve legality. Finally,  we show that the notion of bounding-schemas has wider applicability,  beyond the specific context of LDAP directories.  1 Introduction  X.500 styl...

Learning Situation-Specific Coordination in Cooperative Multi-agent Systems Achieving effective cooperation in a multi-agent system is a difficult problem for a number of reasons such as limited and possiblyout-dated views of activities of other agents and uncertainty about the outcomes of interacting non-local tasks. In this paper, we present a learning system called COLLAGE, that endows the agents with the capability to learn how to choose the most appropriate coordination strategy from a set of available coordination strategies. COLLAGE relies on meta-level information about agents' problem solving situationsto guide them towards a suitable choice for a coordination strategy. We present empirical results that strongly indicate the effectiveness of the learning algorithm.

Case-Based Classification Using Similarity-Based Retrieval Classification involves associating instances with particular classes by maximizing intra-class similarities and minimizing inter-class similarities. The paper presents a novel approach to case-based classification. The algorithm is based on a notion of similarity assessment and was developed for supporting flexible retrieval of relevant information. Validity of the proposed approach is tested on real world domains, and the system's performance is compared to that of other machine learning algorithms. 1 Introduction  Classification involves associating instances with particular classes; based on the object description, the classification system determines whether a given object belongs to a specified class. In general, this process consists of: first generating a set of categories and then classifying given objects into the created categories. For the purpose of this paper, it is assumed that the categories are known a priori from a prescribed domain theory [38]. Various reasoning tech...

Constructive Biology and Approaches to Temporal Grounding in Post-Reactive Robotics Constructive Biology (as opposed to descriptive biology) means understanding biological mechanisms through building systems that exhibit life-like properties. Applications include learning engineering tricks from biological systems, as well as the validation in biological modelling. In particular, biological systems (unlike reactive robots) in the course of development and experience become temporally grounded. Researchers attempting to transcend mere reactivity have been inspired by the drives, motivations, homeostasis, hormonal control, and emotions of animals. In order to contextualize and modulate behavior, these ideas have been introduced into robotics and synthetic agents, while further flexibility is achieved by introducing learning.  Broadening scope of the temporal horizon further requires post-reactive techniques that address not only the action in the now, although such action may perhaps be modulated by drives and affect.

Supporting Imprecision in Multidimensional Databases Using Granularities On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) technologies are being used widely for business-data analysis, and these technologies are also being used increasingly in medical applications, e.g., for patient-data analysis. The lack of effective means of handling data imprecision, which occurs when exact values are not known precisely or are entirely missing, represents a major obstacle in applying OLAP technology to the medical domain, as well as many other domains. OLAP systems are mainly based on a multidimensional model of data and include constructs such as dimension hierarchies and granularities. This paper develops techniques for the handling of imprecision that aim to maximally reusing these already existing constructs. With imprecise data now available in the database, queries are tested to determine whether or not they may be answered precisely given the available data; if not, alternative queries that are unaffected by the imprecision are suggested. When a user elects to proceed with a query that is affected by imprecision, techniques are proposed that take into account the imprecision in the grouping of the data, in the subsequent aggregate computation, and in the presentation of the imprecise result to the user. The approach is capable of exploiting existing multidimensional query processing techniques such as pre-aggregation, yielding an effective approach with low computational overhead and that may be implemented using current technology. The paper illustrates how to implement the approach using SQL databases.

In the spectra of single pixels, the algorithm was able to find basis functions that had a broadband spectrum similar to natural daylight, as well as basis functions that coincided with the human cone sensitivity response functions. When applied to small image patches, the algorithm found homogeneous basis functions, achromatic basis functions, and basis functions with overall chromatic variation along lines in color space. Our findings suggest that ICAmay be used to reveal the structure of color information in natural images. 1 Learning Codes for Color Images The efficient encoding of visual sensory information is an important task for image processing systems as well as for the understanding of coding principles in the visual cortex. Barlow [1] proposed that the goal of sensory information processing is to transform the input signals such that it reduces the redundancy

Learning Models of Other Agents Using Influence Diagrams We adopt decision theory as a descriptive paradigm to model rational agents. We use influence diagrams as a modeling representation of agents, which is used to interact with them and to predict their behavior. In this paper, we provide a framework that an agent can use to learn the models of other agents in a multi-agent system (MAS) based on their observed behavior. Since the correct model is usually not known with certainty our agents maintain a number of possible models and assign a probability to each of them being correct. When none of the available models is likely to be correct, we modify one of them to better account for the observed behaviors. The modification refines the parameters of the influence diagram used to model the other agent's capabilities, preferences, or beliefs. The modified model is then allowed to compete with the other models and the probability assigned to it being correct can be arrived at based on how well it predicts the behaviors of the other agent alrea...

Decidable Fragments of First-Order Modal Logics The paper considers the set ML1 of first-order polymodal formulas the modal operators in which can be applied to subformulas of at most one free variable. Using the mosaic technique, we prove a general satisfiability criterion for formulas in ML1 which reduces the modal satisfiability to the classical one. The criterion is then used to single out a number of new, in a sense optimal, decidable fragments of various predicate modal logics. 1 Introduction  The classical decision problem---to single out expressive and decidable fragments of first-order logic---has a long history and hardly needs any justification: after all, classical first-order logic was and still remains in the very center of logical studies, both in mathematics and applications. Here are only three examples (out of dozens) of such fragments (the choice is not accidental---we shall use these results later on):  ffl the fragment containing only monadic predicate symbols [5];  ffl the fragment with only two individual vari...

Designing Data Warehouses with OO Conceptual Models ions of  our work. We believe that our innovative approach  provides a theoretical foundation for the use of OO  databases and object-relational databases in data  warehouses, MDB, and OLAP applications.  We use UML to design data warehouses because it  considers an information system's structural and  dynamic properties at the conceptual level more naturally  than do classic approaches such as the EntityRelationship  model. Further, UML provides powerful  mechanisms---such as the Object Constraint Language   and the Object Query Language    ---for embedding data  warehouse constraints and initial user requirements in  the conceptual model. This approach to modeling a  data warehouse system yields simple yet powerful  extended UML class diagrams that represent main data  warehouse properties at the conceptual level.

Level Lines as Global Minimizers of Energy Functionals in Image Segmentation We propose a variational framework for determining global  minimizers of rough energy functionals used in image segmentation. Segmentation  is achieved by minimizing an energy model, which is comprised  of two parts: the first part is the interaction between the observed  data and the model, the second is a regularity term. The optimal boundaries  are the set of curves that globally minimize the energy functional.

Facial feature detection by Saccadic Exploration of the Gabor Decomposition The Gabor decomposition is a ubiquitous tool in computer vision. Nevertheless, it is generally considered computationally demanding for active vision applications. We suggest an attention-driven approach to feature detection inspired by the human saccadic system. A dramatic speedup is achieved by computing the Gabor decomposition only on the points of a sparse retinotopic grid. An application to eye detection is presented. Also, a real-time head detection and tracking system based on our approach is briefly discussed. The system features a novel eyeball-mounted camera designed to mimic the dynamic performance of the human eye and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first example of active vision system based on the Gabor decomposition.

A Temporal Description Logic for Reasoning about Actions and Plans A class of interval-based temporal languages for uniformly representing and reasoning about actions and plans is presented. Actions are represented by describing what is true while the action itself is occurring, and plans are constructed by temporally relating actions and world states. The temporal languages are members of the family of Description Logics, which are characterized by high expressivity combined with good computational properties. The subsumption problem for a class of temporal Description Logics is investigated and sound and complete decision procedures are given. The basic languageTL-F is considered rst: it is the composition of a temporal logicTL { able to express interval temporal networks { together with the non-temporal logicF { a Feature Description Logic. It is proven that subsumption in this language is an NP-complete problem. Then it is shown how to reason with the more expressive languagesTLU-FU andTL-ALCF. The former adds disjunction both at the temporal and non-temporal sides of the language, the latter extends the non-temporal side with set-valued features (i.e., roles) and a propositionally complete language. 1.

Text Classification from Labeled and Unlabeled Documents using EM  This paper shows that the accuracy of learned text classifiers can be improved by augmenting a small number of labeled training documents with a large pool of unlabeled documents. This is important because in many text classification problems obtaining training labels is expensive, while large quantities of unlabeled documents are readily available.  We introduce an algorithm for learning from labeled and unlabeled documents based on the combination of Expectation-Maximization (EM) and a naive Bayes classifier. The algorithm first trains a classifier using the available labeled documents, and probabilistically labels the unlabeled documents. It then trains a new classifier using the labels for all the documents, and iterates to convergence. This basic EM procedure works well when the data conform to the generative assumptions of the model. However these assumptions are often violated in practice, and poor performance can result. We present two extensions to the algorithm that improve classification accuracy under these conditions: (1) a weighting factor to modulate the contribution of the unlabeled data, and (2) the use of multiple mixture components per class. Experimental results, obtained using text from three different real-world tasks, show that the use of unlabeled data reduces classification error by up to 30%.

The Necessity Of User Guidance In Case-Based Knowledge Acquisition The intention of the present paper is to justify both theoretically and experimentally that user guidance is inevitable in case-based knowledge acquisition. The methodology of our approach is simple: We choose some paradigmatic idea of case-based learning which can be very briefly expressed as follows:  Given any CBR system, apply it. Whenever it works sucessfully, do not change it. Whenever it fails on some input case, add this experience to the case base. Don't do anything else. Then, we perform a number of knowledge acquisition experiments. They clearly exhibit essential limitations of knowledge acquisition from randomly chosen cases. As a consequence, we develop scenarios of user guidance. Based on these theoretical concepts, we prove a few theoretical results characterizing the power of our approach. Next, we perform a new series of more constrained results which support our theoretical investigations. This paper is based on more than 1 000 000 runs of case-based knowledge acquisi...

Blobworld: A System for Region-Based Image Indexing and Retrieval . Blobworld is a system for image retrieval based on finding coherent image regions which roughly correspond to objects. Each image is automatically segmented into regions ("blobs") with associated color and texture descriptors. Querying is based on the attributes of one or two regions of interest, rather than a description of the entire image. In order to make large-scale retrieval feasible, we index the blob descriptions using a tree. Because indexing in the high-dimensional feature space is computationally prohibitive, we use a lower-rank approximation to the high-dimensional distance. Experiments show encouraging results for both querying and indexing. 1 Introduction  From a user's point of view, the performance of an information retrieval system can be measured by the quality and speed with which it answers the user's information need. Several factors contribute to overall performance:  -- the time required to run each individual query,  -- the quality (precision/recall) of each i...

Integrating Reactive and Scripted Behaviors in a Life-Like Presentation Agent Animated agents- based either on real video, cartoon-style drawings or even model-based 3D graphics- offer great promise for computer-based presentations as they make presentations more lively and appealing and allow for the emulation of conversation styles known from human-human communication. In this paper, we describe a life-like interface agent which presents multimedia material to the user following the directives of a script. The overall behavior of the presentation agent is partly determined by such a script, and partly by the agent's self-behavior. In our approach, the agent's behavior is defined in a declarative specification language. Behavior specifications are used to automatically generate a control module for an agent display system. The first part of the paper describes the generation process which involves AI planning and a two-step compilation. Since the manual creation of presentation scripts is tedious and error-prone, we also address the automated generation of presentation scripts which may be forwarded to the interface agent. The second part of the paper presents an approach for multimedia presentation design which combines hierarchical planning with temporal reasoning. 1.1 Keywords human-like qualities of synthetic agents, life-like qualities, presentation agents

Capturing Natural Hand Articulation Vision-based motion capturing of hand articulation is a challenging task, since the hand presents a motion of high degrees of freedom. Model-based approaches could be taken to approach this problem by searching in a high dimensional hand state space, and matching projections of a hand model and image observations. However, it is highly inefficient due to the curse of dimensionality. Fortunately, natural hand articulation is highly constrained, which largely reduces the dimensionality of hand state space. This paper presents a model-based method to capture hand articulation by learning hand natural constraints. Our study shows that natural hand articulation lies in a lower dimensional configurations space characterized by a union of linear manifolds spanned by a set of basis configurations. By integrating hand motion constraints, an efficient articulated motion-capturing algorithm is proposed based on sequential Monte Carlo techniques. Our experiments show that this algorithm is robust and accurate for tracking natural hand movements. This algorithm is easy to extend to other articulated motion capturing tasks.

Supporting Reuse by Delivering Task-Relevant and Personalized Information Technical, cognitive, and social factors inhibit the widespread success of systematic software reuse. Our research is primarily concerned with the cognitive and social challenges faced by software developers: how to motivate them to reuse and how to reduce the difficulty of locating components from a large reuse repository. Our research has explored a new interaction style between software developers and reuse repository systems enabled by information delivery mechanisms. Instead of passively waiting for software developers to explore the reuse repository with explicit queries, information delivery autonomously locates and presents components by using the developers' partially written programs as implicit queries.  We have designed, implemented, and evaluated a system called CodeBroker, which illustrates different techniques to address the essential challenges in information delivery: to make the delivered information relevant to the task-at-hand and personalized to the background knowledge of an individual developer. Empirical evaluations of CodeBroker show that information delivery is effective in promoting reuse.

Long-Term Learning from User Behavior in Content-Based Image Retrieval This article describes an algorithm for obtaining knowledge about the importance of features  from analyzing user log les of a content-based image retrieval system (CBIRS). The  user log les from the usage of the Viper web demonstration system are analyzed over a period  of four months. Within this period about 3500 accesses to the system were made with almost  800 multiple image queries. All the actions of the users were logged in a le.  The analysis only includes multiple image queries of the system with positive and/or negative  input images, because only multiple image queries contain enough information for the  method described. Features frequently present in images marked together positively in the  same query step get a higher weighting, whereas features present in one image marked positively  and another image marked negatively in the same step get a lower weighting. The  Viper system oers a very large number of simple features. This allows the creation of exible  feature ...

Learning to Resolve Natural Language Ambiguities: A Unified Approach We analyze a few of the commonly used statistics based and machine learning algorithms for natural language disambiguation tasks and observe that they can be recast as learning linear separators in the feature space. Each of the methods makes a priori assumptions, which it employs, given the data, when searching for its hypothesis. Nevertheless, as we show, it searches a space that is as rich as the space of all linear separators. We use this to build an argument for a data driven approach which merely searches for a good linear separator in the feature space, without further assumptions on the domain or a specific problem. We present such an approach - a sparse network of linear separators, utilizing the Winnow learning algorithm - and show how to use it in a variety of ambiguity resolution problems. The learning approach presented is attribute-efficient and, therefore, appropriate for domains having very large number of attributes. In particular, we present an extensive experimental ...

Efficiently Querying Moving Objects with Pre-defined Paths in a Distributed Environment Due to the recent growth of the World Wide Web, numerous spatio-temporal applications can obtain their required information from publicly available web sources. We consider those sources maintaining moving objects with predefined paths and schedules, and investigate different plans to perform queries on the integration of these data sources efficiently. Examples of such data sources are networks of railroad paths and schedules for trains running between cities connected through these networks. A typical query on such data sources is to find all trains that pass through a given point on the network within a given time interval. We show that traditional filter+semi-join plans would not result in efficient query response times on distributed spatio-temporal sources. Hence, we propose a novel spatio-temporal filter, called deviation filter, that exploits both the spatial and temporal characteristics of the sources in order to improve the selectivity. We also report on our experiments in comparing the performances of the alternative query plans and conclude that the plan with spatio-temporal filter is the most viable and superior plan.

EMP - A Database-Driven Electronic Market Place for Business-to-Business Commerce on the Internet Electronic commerce systems for business-to-business commerce on the Internet are still in their infancy. The realization of Internet electronic markets for business-to-business following a n-suppliers : m-customers scenario is still unattainable with todays solutions. Comprehensive Internet electronic commerce systems should provide for easy access to and handling of the system, help to overcome di#erences in time of business, location, language between suppliers and customers, and at the same time should support the entire process of trading for business-to-business commerce. In this paper, we present a DBMS-based electronic commerce architecture and its prototypical implementation for business-to-business commerce according to a n-suppliers : mcustomers  scenario. Business transactions within the electronic market are realized by a set of modular market services. Multiple physically distributed markets can be interconnected transparently to the users and form one virtually central market place. The modeling and management of all market data in a DBMS gives the system a solid basis for reliable, consistent, and secure trading on the market. The generic and modular system architecture can be applied to arbitrary application domains. The system is scalable and can cope with an increasing number of single markets, participants, and market data due to the possibility to replicate and distribute services and data and herewith to distribute data, system, and network load.

Random Probability Functions Random probability functions are required in Monte Carlo simulations for expert systems testing. Here I give an empirical method for generating such functions. While this is a practical problem, its solution raises interesting philosophical questions. The design of expert systems is an important problem in the field of Artificial Intelligence. One task, for instance, is to give a general methodology for diagnosis which can be used to construct computer experts in a whole range of areas such as the diagnosis of hepatitis and fault-finding in circuit boards. Clearly before these artificial experts can be used to make critical decisions they must be thoroughly tested and their reliability ascertained. Two approaches to testing stand out: empirical experiments and Monte Carlo simulations. Empirical testing is certainly desirable, but there may not be enough empirical data readily available.

Document Expansion for Speech Retrieval Advances in automatic speech recognition allow us to search large speech collections using traditional information retrieval  methods. The problem of "aboutness" for documents --- is a document about a certain concept --- has been at the core of document indexing for the entire history of IR. This problem is more difficult for speech indexing since automatic speech transcriptions often contain mistakes. In this study we show that document expansion can be successfully used to alleviate the effect of transcription mistakes on speech retrieval. The loss of retrieval effectiveness due to automatic transcription errors can be reduced by document expansion from 15--27% relative to retrieval from human transcriptions to only about 7--13%, even for automatic transcriptions with word error rates as high as 65%. For good automatic transcriptions (25% word error rate), retrieval effectiveness with document expansion is indistinguishable from retrieval from human transcriptions. This makes speech...

Towards a Multi-Agent System for Pro-active Information Management in Anesthesia . Decision-making in anesthesia requires the integration of information  from various clinical data sources, such as the patient, the  laboratory, the surgery and the clinical personnel. However, information  management and processing is aggravated by the highly heterogeneous  and distributed nature of the current clinical data and information  repositories. Furthermore, critical situations such as the arrival of emergency  patients demand the context-sensitive provision of information in  a timely fashion. We argue that multi-agent architectures can help to  overcome these problems. In the clinical information space, autonomous  agents can pro-actively collect, integrate and analyze the required data  and condense and communicate the most relevant information.

Quilt: An XML Query Language for Heterogeneous Data Sources The World Wide Web promises to transform human society by making virtually all types of information instantly available everywhere. Two prerequisites for this promise to be realized are a universal markup language and a universal query language. The power and flexibility of XML make it the leading candidate for a universal markup language. XML provides a way to label information from diverse data sources including structured and semi-structured documents, relational databases, and object repositories. Several XML-based query languages have been proposed, each oriented toward a specific category of information. Quilt is a new proposal that attempts to unify concepts from several of these query languages, resulting in a new language that exploits the full versatility of XML. The name Quilt suggests both the way in which features from several languages were assembled to make a new query language, and the way in which Quilt queries can combine information from diverse data sources into a query result with a new structure of its own.

Matching in Description Logics: Preliminary Results Matching of concepts with variables (concept patterns) is a relatively new operation that has been introduced in the context of concept description languages (description logics), originally to help discard unimportant aspects of large concepts appearing in industrial-strength knowledge bases. This paper proposes a new approach to performing matching, based on a "concept-centered" normal form, rather than the more standard "structural subsumption" normal form for concepts. As a result, matching can be performed (in polynomial time) using  arbitrary concept patterns of the description language FL: , thus removing restrictions from previous work. The paper also addresses the question of matching problems with additional "side conditions", which were motivated by practical experience.  1 Introduction  The traditional inference problems for Description Logic (DL) systems (like subsumption) are now wellinvestigated. This means that algorithms are available for solving the subsumption proble...

Personalized Web-Document Filtering Using Reinforcement Learning Abstract- Document filtering is increasingly deployed in Web environments to reduce information overload of users. We formulate online information filtering as a reinforcement learning problem, i.e. TD(0). The goal is to learn user profiles that best represent his information needs and thus maximize the expected value of user relevance feedback. A method is then presented that acquires reinforcement signals automatically by estimating user‚Äôs implicit feedback from direct observations of browsing behaviors. This ‚Äúlearning by observation ‚Äù approach is contrasted with conventional relevance feedback methods which require explicit user feedbacks. Field tests have been performed which involved 10 users reading a total of 18,750 HTML documents during 45 days. Compared to the existing document filtering techniques, the proposed learning method showed superior performance in information quality and adaptation speed to user preferences in online filtering. 1

The Role of Information Extraction for Textual CBR Abstract. The benefits of CBR methods in domains where cases are text depend on the underlying text representation. Today, most TCBR approaches are limited to the degree that they are based on efficient, but weak IR methods. These do not allow for reasoning about the similarities between cases, which is mandatory for many CBR tasks beyond text retrieval, including adaptation or argumentation. In order to carry out more advanced CBR that compares complex cases in terms of abstract indexes, NLP methods are required to derive a better case representation. This paper discusses how state-of-the-art NLP/IE methods might be used for automatically extracting relevant factual information, preserving information captured in text structure and ascertaining negation. It also presents our ongoing research on automatically deriving abstract indexing concepts from legal case texts. We report progress toward integrating IE techniques and ML for generalizing from case texts to our CBR case representation. 1

A simulation study shows the feasibility of the approach and the flexibility with which different types of bottlenecks can be circumvented.  1 Introduction  Replication is often seen as a mechanism to increase availability and performance in distributed databases.

Learning to Extract Symbolic Knowledge from the World Wide Web The World Wide Web is a vast source of information accessible to computers, but understandable only to humans. The goal of the research described here is to automatically create a computer understandable knowledge base whose content mirrors that of the World Wide Web. Such a knowledge base would enable much more e ective retrieval of Web information, and promote new uses of the Web to support knowledge-based inference and problem solving. Our approach istodevelop a trainable information extraction system that takes two inputs. The rst is an ontology that de nes the classes (e.g., Company, Person, Employee, Product) and relations (e.g., Employed.By, Produced.By) ofinterest when creating the knowledge base.

Scalable Replication in Database Clusters The widespread use of clusters and web farms has increased the importance of data replication. In existing protocols, typical distributed system solutions emphasize fault tolerance at the price of performance while database solutions emphasize performance at the price of consistency. In this paper, we explore the use of data replication in a cluster configuration with the objective of providing both fault tolerance and good performance without compromising consistency. We do this by combining transactional concurrency control with group communication primitives. In our approach, transactions are executed at only one site so that not all nodes incur in the overhead of parsing, optimizing, and producing results. To further reduce latency, we use an optimistic multicast approach that overlaps transaction execution with the total order message delivery. The techniques we present in the paper provide correct executions while minimizing overhead and providing higher scalability.

Efficient and Effective Metasearch for Text Databases Incorporating Linkages among Documents Linkages among documents have a significant impact on the importance of documents, as it can be argued that important documents are pointed to by many documents or by other important documents. Metasearch engines can be used to facilitate ordinary users for retrieving information from multiple local sources (text databases). In a large-scale metasearch engine, the contents of each local database is represented by a representative. Each user query is evaluated against the set of representatives of all databases in order to determine the appropriate databases to search. In previous works, the linkage information between documents has not been utilized in determining the appropriate databases to search. In this paper, such information is employed to determine the degree of relevance of a document with respect to a given query. This information is then stored in each database representative to facilitate the selection of databases for each given query. We establish a necessary an...

Social Mental Shaping: Modelling the Impact of Sociality on the Mental States of Autonomous Agents This paper presents a framework that captures how the social nature of agents that are situated in a multi-agent environment impacts upon their individual mental states. Roles and social relationships provide an abstraction upon which we develop the notion of social mental shaping. This allows us to extend the standard Belief-DesireIntention model to account for how common social phenomena (e.g. cooperation, collaborative problem-solving and negotiation) can be integrated into a unified theoretical perspective that reflects a fully explicated model of the autonomous agent's mental state.

Evaluating the Novelty of Text-Mined Rules Using Lexical Knowledge A data-mining system may discover a large body of rules; however, relatively few of these may convey useful new knowledge to the user. Several metrics for evaluating the "interestingness" of mined rules have been proposed. However, most of these measure simplicity (e.g. rule size), certainty (e.g. confidence), or utility (e.g. support). Another important aspect of interestingness is novelty: does the rule represent an association that is currently unknown. In this paper, we present a new method of estimating the novelty of rules discovered by data-mining methods using WordNet, a lexical knowledge-base of English words. We have shown that novelty of a rule can be assessed by the average semantic distance in a knowledge hierarchy between the words in the antecedent and the consequent of the rule - the more the average distance, more is the novelty of the rule. We present an experimental evaluation of this novelty metric by applying it to rules mined from book descriptions extracted from A...

Machine Learning for Modeling Dutch Pronunciation Variation This paper describes the use of rule induction techniques for the automatic extraction of phonemic knowledge and rules from pairs of pronunciation lexica. This extracted knowledge allows the adaptation of speech processing systems to regional variants of a language. As a case study, we apply the approach to Northern Dutch and Flemish (the variant of Dutch spoken in Flanders, a part of Belgium) , based on Celex and Fonilex, pronunciation lexica for Northern Dutch and Flemish, respectively. In our study, we compare two rule induction techniques, TransformationBased Error-Driven Learning (TBEDL) (Brill, 1995) and C5.0 (Quinlan, 1993), and evaluate the extracted knowledge quantitatively (accuracy) and qualitatively (linguistic relevance of the rules). We conclude that, whereas classication-based rule induction with C5.0 is more accurate, the transformation rules learned with TBEDL can be more easily interpreted.  1 Introduction  A central component of speech processing systems is a pronun...

Argumentation and Multi-Agent Decision Making This paper summarises our on-going work on mixedinitiative decision making which extends both classical decision theory and a symbolic theory of decision making based on argumentation to a multi-agent domain. Introduction  One focus of our work at Queen Mary and Westfield College is the development of multi-agent systems which deal with real world problems, an example being the diagnosis of faults in electricity distribution networks (Jennings et al. 1996). These systems are mixed-initiative in the sense that they depend upon interactions between agents---no single agent has sufficient skills or resources to carry out the tasks which the multi-agent system as a whole is faced with. Because the systems are built to operate in the real world, the agents are forced to deal with the usual problems of incomplete and uncertain information, and increasingly we are turning to the use of techniques from decision theory, both classical and non-standard, in order to ensure that our agents make so...

Surfing the Digital Wave - Generating Personalised TV Listings using Collaborative, Case-Based Recommendation Abstract. In the future digital TV will offer an unprecedented level of programme choice. We are told that this will lead to dramatic increases in viewer satisfaction as all viewing tastes are catered for all of the time. However, the reality may be somewhat different. We have not yet developed the tools to deal with this increased level of choice (for example, conventional TV guides will be virtually useless), and viewers will face a significant and frustrating information overload problem. This paper describes a solution in the form of the PTV system. PTV employs user profiling and information filtering techniques to generate web-based TV viewing guides that are personalised for the viewing preferences of individual users. The paper explains how PTV constructs graded user profiles to drive a hybrid recommendation technique, combining case-based and collaborative information filtering methods. The results of an extensive empirical study to evaluate the quality of PTV‚Äôs casebased and collaborative filtering strategies are also described. 1

Design of RapidBase - an Active Measurement Database System In data-intensive industrial on-line applications utilizing live process data, one faces an unusual set of database requirements. The process measurement data need to be acquired at great speed, organized in time series and made available for time-based retrieval. Active capabilities and functional extensibility are needed to implement a flexible data-driven processing paradigm. An efficient transaction logging and recovery mechanism is needed in order not to impede the data acquisition flow. RapidBase is a system that meets these requirements. It utilizes a main-memory database, a unique temporal-relational data model for handling time series, and an elaborate trigger subsystem. It is implemented as a server program equipped with interfaces of high power of expression.  1 Introduction  Although the requirement for data management is omnipresent in various advanced applications, the main-stream notion of a database may be not a best choice in all cases.

Prosody Modeling in Concept-to-Speech Generation: Methodological Issues Generation of Intensive Care data), a system that generates multimedia briefings of a patient's status after having a bypass operation (Dalal et al. 1996; McKeown et al. 1997). We first describe information MAGIC generates in the process of producing language, turning next to the corpora we collected. We then provide a description of the more traditional approach to prosody modeling, using machine learning that generalizes over many examples, followed by a description of our memory-based approach. Our results show the memory-based approach yields a better improvement in quality, measured through subjective judgments of output.  2. Information from Language Generation  In the course of producing language, language generators typically produce a variety of intermediate linguistic representations that contain information which potentially could influence prosody. Some of this information is similar to the kind of information used in TTS, such as part-of-speech (POS) tags or syntactic cons...

First-Order Representation of Stable Models Turi (1991) introduced the important notion of a constrained atom: an atom with associated equality and disequality constraints on its arguments. A set of constrained atoms is a constrained interpretation. We investigate how non-ground representations of both the stable model semantics and the well-founded semantics may be obtained through Turi‚Äôs approach. The practical implication of this is that the wellfounded model (or the set of stable models) may be partially pre-computed at compile-time, resulting in the association of each predicate symbol in the program to a constrained atom. Algorithms to create such models are presented, both for the well founded case, and the case of stable models. Query processing reduces to checking whether each atom in the query is true in a stable model (resp. well-founded model). This amounts to showing the atom is an instance of one of some constrained atom whose associated constraint is solvable. Various related complexity results are explored, and the impacts of these results are discussed from the point of view of implementing systems that incorporate the stable and well-founded semantics.

Trajectory Guided Tracking and Recognition of Actions A combined 2D, 3D approach is presented that allows for robust tracking of moving people and  recognition of actions. It is assumed that the system observes multiple moving objects via a single,  uncalibrated video camera. Low-level features are often insufficient for detection, segmentation, and  tracking of non-rigid moving objects. Therefore, an improved mechanism is proposed that integrates  low-level (image processing), mid-level (recursive 3D trajectory estimation), and high-level (action  recognition) processes. A novel extended Kalman filter formulation is used in estimating the relative  3D motion trajectories up to a scale factor. The recursive estimation process provides a prediction  and error measure that is exploited in higher-level stages of action recognition. Conversely, higherlevel  mechanisms provide feedback that allows the system to reliably segment and maintain the  tracking of moving objects before, during, and after occlusion. The 3D trajectory, occlusion, and  segmentation information are utilized in extracting stabilized views of the moving object that are then  used as input to action recognition modules. Trajectory-guided recognition (TGR) is proposed as a  new and efficient method for adaptive classification of action. The TGR approach is demonstrated  using "motion history images" that are then recognized via a mixture-of-Gaussians classifier. The  system was tested in recognizing various dynamic human outdoor activities: running, walking, roller  blading, and cycling. Experiments with real and synthetic data sets are used to evaluate stability of  the trajectory estimator with respect to noise.

An Experimental Performance Evaluation of Incremental Materialized View Maintenance in Object Databases Abstract. The development of techniques for supporting incremental maintenance of materialized views has been an active research area for over twenty years. However, although there has been much research on methods and algorithms, there are surprisingly few systematic studies on the performance of different approaches. As a result, understanding of the circumstances in which materialized views are beneficial (or not) can be seen to lag behind research on incremental maintenance techniques. This paper presents the results of an experimental performance analysis carried out in a system that incrementally maintains OQL views in an ODMG compliant object database. The results indicate how the effectiveness of incremental maintenance is affected by issues such as database size, and the complexity and selectivity of views. 1

A Generalized Modeling Framework for Schema Versioning Support Advanced object-oriented applications require the management of schema versions, in order to cope with changes in the structure of the stored data. Two types of versioning have been separately considered so far: branching and temporal. The former arose in application domains like CAD/CAM and software engineering, where different solutions have been proposed to support design schema versions (consolidated versions). The latter concerns temporal databases, where some works considered temporal schema versioning to fulfil advanced needs of other typical objectoriented applications like GIS and the multimedia ones.  In this work, we propose a general model which integrates the two approaches by supporting both design and temporal schema versions. The model is provided with a complete set of schema change primitives for full-fledged version manipulation whose semantics is described in the paper.

Lock-free Scheduling of Logical Processes in Parallel Simulation With fixed lookahead information in a simulation model, the overhead of asynchronous conservative parallel simulation lies in the mechanism used for propagating time updates in order for logical processes to safely advance their local simulation clocks. Studies have shown that a good scheduling algorithm should preferentially schedule processes containing events on the critical path. This paper introduces a lock-free algorithm for scheduling logical processes in conservative parallel discrete-event simulation on shared-memory multiprocessor machines. The algorithm uses fetch&add operations that help avoid inefficiencies associated with using locks. The lock-free algorithm is robust. Experiments show that, compared with the scheduling algorithm using locks, the lock-free algorithm exhibits better performance when the number of logical processes assigned to each processor is small or when the workload becomes significant. In models with large number of logical processes, our algorithm sh...

Finding Text Regions Using Localised Measures We present a method based on statistical properties of local image neighbourhoods for the location of text in real-scene images. This has applications in robot vision, and desktop and wearable computing. The statistical measures we describe extract properties of the image which characterise text, invariant to a large degree to the orientation, scale or colour of the text in the scene. The measures are employed by a neural network to classify regions of an image as text or non-text. We thus avoid the use of different thresholds for the various situations we expect, including when text is too small to read, or when the text plane is not fronto-parallel to the camera. We briefly discuss applications and the possibility of recovery of the text for optical character recognition. 1 Introduction Automatic location and digitisation of text in arbitrary scenes, where the text may or may not be fronto-parallel to the viewing plane, is an area of computer vision which has not yet been ...

Time Split Linear Quadtree For Indexing Image Databases The Time Split B-Tree (TSBT) is modified for indexing a database of evolving binary images. This is accomplished by embedding ideas from Linear region Quadtrees that make the TSBT able to support spatio-temporal query processing. To improve query performance, additional pointers are added to the leaf-nodes of the TSBT. The resulting access method is called Time Split Linear Quadtree (TSLQ). Algorithms for processing five spatio-temporal queries have been adapted to the new structure. Such queries appear in Multimedia Systems, or Geographical Information Systems (GIS), when searched by content. The TSLQ was implemented and results of extensive experiments on query time performance are presented, indicating that the proposed algorithmic approaches outbalance respective straightforward algorithms. The region data sets used in the experiments were real images of meteorological satellite views and synthetic raster images.

Logic-Based Subsumption Architecture In this paper we describe a logic-based AI architecture based on Brooks'  Subsumption Architecture. We axiomatize each of the layers of control in  his system separately and use independent theorem provers to derive each  layer's output actions given its inputs. We implement the subsumption  of lower layers by higher layers using circumscription. We give formal  semantics to our approach.  1 Introduction  In [?], Brooks proposed a reactive architecture embodying an approach to robot control different on various counts from traditional approaches. He decomposed the problem into layers corresponding to levels of behavior, rather than according to a sequential, functional form. Within this setting he introduced the idea of subsumption, that is, that more complex layers could not only depend on lower, more reactive layers, but could also influence their behavior. The resulting architecture was one that could service simultaneously multiple, potentially conflicting goals in a reactive fashi...

GQL: A Reasonable Complex SQL for Genomic Databases Validating hypotheses and reasoning about objects is becoming commonplace in biotechnology research. The capability to reason strengthens comparative genomics research by providing the much needed tool to pose intelligent queries in a more convenient and declarative fashion. To be able to reason using Genomic Query Language (GQL), we propose the idea of parameterized views as an extension of SQL's create view construct with an optional with parameter clause. Parameterizing enables traditional SQL views to accept input values and delay the computation of the view until invoked with a call statement. This extension empowers users with the capability of modifying the behavior of predened procedures (views) by sending arguments and evaluating the procedure on demand. We demonstrate that the extension is soundly based, with a parallel in Datalog. We also show that the idea of relational unication proposed here empowers SQL to reason and infer in exactly the same way as an Object-Oriented ...

MindReader: Querying databases through multiple examples Users often can not easily express their queries. For example, in a multimedia/image by content setting, the user might want photographs with sunsets; in current systems, like QBIC, the user has to give a sample query, and to specify the relative importance of color, shape and texture. Even worse, the user might want correlations between attributes, like, for example, in a traditional, medical record database, a medical researcher might want to find "mildly overweight patients", where the implied query would be "weight/height &asymp; 4 lb/inch". Our goal is to provide a user-friendly, but theoretically solid method, to handle such queries. We allow the user to give several examples, and, optionally, their 'goodness' scores, and we propose a novel method to "guess" which attributes are important, which correlations are important, and with what weight. Our contributions are twofold: (a) we formalize the problem as a minimization problem and show how to solve for the optimal solution, completely av...

On the Role of BDI Modelling for Integrated Control and Coordinated Behavior in Autonomous Agents This paper describes an architecture for controlling and coordinating autonomous agents, building on previous work addressing reactive and deliberative control methods. The proposed multi-layered hybrid architecture allows a rationally bounded, goal-directed agent to reason predictively about potential conflicts by constructing knowledge level models which explain other agents' observed behaviors and hypothesize their beliefs, desires, and intentions; at the same time it enables the agent to operate autonomously, to react promptly to changes in its real-time environment, and to coordinate its actions effectively with other agents. A principal aim of this research is to understand the role different functional capabilities play in constraining an agent's behavior under varying environmental conditions. To this end, an experimental testbed has been constructed comprising a simulated multi-agent world in which a variety of agent configurations and behaviors have been investigated. A numbe...

Event-Driven FRP Abstract. Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) is a high-level declarative language for programming reactive systems. Previous work on FRP has demonstrated its utility in a wide range of application domains, including animation, graphical user interfaces, and robotics. FRP has an elegant continuous-time denotational semantics. However, it guarantees no bounds on execution time or space, thus making it unsuitable for many embedded real-time applications. To alleviate this problem, we recently developed Real-Time FRP (RT-FRP), whose operational semantics permits us to formally guarantee bounds on both execution time and space. In this paper we present a formally verifiable compilation strategy from a new language based on RT-FRP into imperative code. The new language, called Event-Driven FRP (E-FRP), is more tuned to the paradigm of having multiple external events. While it is smaller than RT-FRP, it features a key construct that allows us to compile the language into efficient code. We have used this language and its compiler to generate code for a small robot controller that runs on a PIC16C66 micro-controller. Because the formal specification of compilation was crafted more for clarity and for technical convenience, we describe an implementation that produces more efficient code. 1

Automatically Labeling Web Pages Based on Normal User Actions For agents attempting to learn a user's interests, the cost of obtaining labeled training instances is prohibitive because the user must directly label each training instance, and few users are willing to do so. We present an approach that circumvents the need for human-labeled pages. Instead, we learn `surrogate' tasks where the desired output is easily measured, such as the number of hyperlinks clicked on a page or the amount of scrolling performed. Our assumption is that these outputs will highly correlate with the user's interests. In other words, by unobtrusively `observing' the user's behavior we are able to learn functions of value. For example, an agent could silently observe the user's browser behavior during the day, then use these training examples to learn such functions and gather, during the middle of the night, pages that are likely to be of interest to the user. Previous work has focused on learning a user profile by passively observing the hyperlinks clicked on and tho...

A Hierarchical Probabilistic Model for Novelty Detection in Text Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a variant of classification in which the classes are not known or fixed in advance. Consider for example an incoming stream of news articles or email messages that are to be classified by topic; new classes must be created as new topics arise. The problem is a challenging one for machine learning. Instances of new topics must be recognized as not belonging to any of the existing classes (detection), and instances of old topics must be correctly classified (tracking)---often with extremely little training data per class. This paper proposes a new approach to TDT based on probabilistic, generative models. Strong statistical techniques are used to address the many challenges: hierarchical shrinkage for sparse data, statistical "garbage collection" for new event detection, clustering in time to separate the different events of a common topic, and deterministic annealing for creating the hierarchy. Preliminary experimental results show promise.  Keyword...

A Hybrid Approach to the Profile Creation and Intrusion Detection Anomaly detection involves characterizing the behaviors of individuals or systems and recognizing behavior that is outside the norm. This paper describes some preliminary results concerning the robustness and generalization capabilities of machine learning methods in creating user profiles based on the selection and subsequent classification of command line arguments. We base our method on the belief that legitimate users can be classified into categories based on the percentage of commands they use in a specified period. The hybrid approach we employ begins with the application of expert rules to reduce the dimensionality of the data, followed by an initial clustering of the data and subsequent refinement of the cluster locations using a competitive network called Learning Vector Quantization. Since Learning Vector Quantization is a nearest neighbor classifier, and new record presented to the network that lies outside a specified distance is classified as a masquerader. Thus, this system does not require anomalous records to be included in the training set. 1.

Providing Persistent Objects in Distributed Systems Abstract. THOR is a persistent object store that provides a powerful programming model. THOR ensures that persistent objects are accessed only by calling their methods and it supports atomic transactions. The result is a system that allows applications to share objects safely across both space and time. The paper describes how the THOR implementation is able to support this powerful model and yet achieve good performance, even in a wide-area, large-scale distributed environment. It describes the techniques used in THOR to meet the challenge of providing good performance in spite of the need to manage very large numbers of very small objects. In addition, the paper puts the performance of THOR in perspective by showing that it substantially outperforms a system based on memory mapped files, even though that system provides much less functionality than THOR. 1

Support Vector Learning for Ordinal Regression We investigate the problem of predicting variables of ordinal scale. This task is referred to as ordinal regression  and is complementary to the standard machine learning tasks of classification and metric regression. In contrast to statistical models we present a distribution independent formulation of the problem together with uniform bounds of the risk functional. The approach presented is based on a mapping from objects to scalar utility values. Similar to Support Vector methods we derive a new learning algorithm for the task of ordinal regression based on large margin rank boundaries. We give experimental results for an information retrieval task: learning the order of documents w.r.t. an initial query. Experimental results indicate that the presented algorithm outperforms more naive approaches to ordinal regression such as Support Vector classification and Support Vector regression in the case of more than two ranks. 1 Introduction  Problems of ordinal regression arise in many fi...

Multimodal System Processing in Mobile Environments One major goal of multimodal system design is to support more robust performance than can be achieved with a unimodal recognition technology, such as a spoken language system. In recent years, the multimodal literatures on speech and pen input and speech and lip movements have begun developing relevant performance criteria and demonstrating a reliability advantage for multimodal architectures. In the present studies, over 2,600 utterances processed by a multimodal pen/voice system were collected during both mobile and stationary use. A new data collection infrastructure was developed, including instrumentation worn by the user while roaming, a researcher field station, and a multimodal data logger and analysis tool tailored for mobile research. Although speech recognition as a stand-alone failed more often during mobile system use, the results confirmed that a more stable multimodal architecture decreased this error rate by 19-35%. Furthermore, these findings were replicated across different types of microphone technology. In large part this performance gain was due to significant levels of mutual disambiguation in the multimodal architecture, with higher levels occurring in the noisy mobile environment. Implications of these findings are discussed for expanding computing to support more challenging usage contexts in a robust manner.

We do this in a location-oriented way.  The experimental MIS application features a "location-oriented meta search" for Web  database servers, a "location-oriented robot-based search" called kokono Search for distributed  Web documents, and a simple interface based on the latitude and longitude of the user's location,  which are obtained from the user's PHS or GPS.

Multistrategy Learning for Information Extraction Information extraction (IE) is the problem of filling out pre-defined structured summaries from text documents. We are interested in performing IE in non-traditional domains, where much of the text is often ungrammatical, such as electronic bulletin board posts and Web pages. We suggest that the best approach is one that takes into account many different kinds of information, and argue for the suitability of a multistrategy approach. We describe learners for IE drawn from three separate machine learning paradigms: rote memorization, term-space text classification, and relational rule induction. By building regression models mapping from learner confidence to probability of correctness and combining probabilities appropriately, it is possible to improve extraction accuracy over that achieved by any individual learner. We describe three different multistrategy approaches. Experiments on two IE domains, a collection of electronic seminar announcements from a university computer science de...

A Web Odyssey: from Codd to XML INTRODUCTION  The Web presents the database area with vast opportunities and commensurate challenges. Databases and the Web are organically connected at many levels. Web sites are increasingly powered by databases. Collections of linked Web pages distributed across the Internet are themselves tempting targets for a database. The emergence of XML as the lingua franca of the Web brings some much needed order and will greatly facilitate the use of database techniques to manage Web information.  This paper will discuss some of the developments related to the Web from the viewpoint of database theory. As we shall see, the Web scenario requires revisiting some of the basic assumptions of the area. To be sure, database theory remains as valid as ever in the classical setting, and the database industry will continue to representamulti-billion dollar target of applicability for the foreseeable future. But the Web represents an opportunityofanentirely di#erent scale. We are th

Positioning a coarse-calibrated camera with respect to an unknown object by 2D 1/2 visual servoing In this paper we propose a new vision-based robot control approach halfway between the classical positionbased and image-based visual servoings. It allows to avoid their respective disadvantages. The homography between some planar feature points extracted from two images (corresponding to the current and desired camera poses) is computed at each iteration. Then, an approximate partial-pose, where the translational term is known only up to a scale factor, is deduced, from which can be designed a closed-loop control law controlling the six camera d.o.f.. Contrarily to the position-based visual servoing, our scheme does not need any geometric 3D model of the object. Furthermore and contrarily to the image-based visual servoing, our approach ensures the convergence of the control law in all the task space.

Mobile Agent-based Compound Documents This paper presents a mobile agent-based framework for building mobile compound document, which can each be dynamically composed of mobile agents and can migrate itself over a network as a whole, with all its embedded agents. The key of this framework is that it builds a hierarchical mobile agent system that enables multiple mobile agents to be combined into a single mobile agent. The framework also provides several value-added mechanisms for visually manipulating components embedded in a compound document and for sharing a window on the screen among the components. This paper describes this framework and some experiences in the implementation of a prototype system, currently using Java the both implementation language and component development language, and then illustrates several interesting applications to demonstrate the framework's utility and flexibility.  1.

Efficient Data Mining for Path Traversal Patterns Abstract‚ÄîIn this paper, we explore a new data mining capability that involves mining path traversal patterns in a distributed information-providing environment where documents or objects are linked together to facilitate interactive access. Our solution procedure consists of two steps. First, we derive an algorithm to convert the original sequence of log data into a set of maximal forward references. By doing so, we can filter out the effect of some backward references, which are mainly made for ease of traveling and concentrate on mining meaningful user access sequences. Second, we derive algorithms to determine the frequent traversal patterns¬¶i.e., large reference sequences¬¶from the maximal forward references obtained. Two algorithms are devised for determining large reference sequences; one is based on some hashing and pruning techniques, and the other is further improved with the option of determining large reference sequences in batch so as to reduce the number of database scans required. Performance of these two methods is comparatively analyzed. It is shown that the option of selective scan is very advantageous and can lead to prominent performance improvement. Sensitivity analysis on various parameters is conducted. Index Terms‚ÄîData mining, traversal patterns, distributed information system, World Wide Web, performance analysis.

Efficient Complex Query Support for Multiversion XML Documents Managing multiple versions of XML documents represents a  critical requirement for many applications. Also, there has been much  recent interest in supporting complex queries on XML data (e.g., regular  path expressions, structural projections, DIFF queries). In this paper,  we examine the problem of supporting efficiently complex queries on  multiversioned XML documents. Our approach relies on a scheme based  on durable node numbers (DNNs) that preserve the order among the  XML tree nodes and are invariant with respect to updates. Using the  document's DNNs various complex queries are reduced to combinations  of partial version retrieval queries. We examine three indexing schemes to  efficiently evaluate partial version retrieval queries in this environment. A  thorough performance analysis is then presented to reveal the advantages  of each scheme.

Automatic Discovery of Subgoals in Reinforcement Learning using Diverse Density This paper presents a method by which a reinforcement  learning agent can automatically discover  certain types of subgoals online. By creating  useful new subgoals while learning, the agent  is able to accelerate learning on the current task  and to transfer its expertise to other, related tasks  through the reuse of its ability to attain subgoals.  The agent discovers subgoals based on commonalities  across multiple paths to a solution. We  cast the task of finding these commonalities as  a multiple-instance learning problem and use the  concept of diverse density to find solutions. We  illustrate this approach using several gridworld  tasks.  1.

Capturing Knowledge of User Preferences: Ontologies in Recommender Systems Tools for filtering the World Wide Web exist, but they are hampered by the difficulty of capturing user preferences in such a dynamic environment. We explore the acquisition of user profiles by unobtrusive monitoring of browsing behaviour and application of supervised machine-learning techniques coupled with an ontological representation to extract user preferences. A multi-class approach to paper classification is used, allowing the paper topic taxonomy to be utilised during profile construction. The Quickstep recommender system is presented and two empirical studies evaluate it in a real work setting, measuring the effectiveness of using a hierarchical topic ontology compared with an extendable flat list.

Secret Computation with Secrets for Mobile Agent using One-time Proxy Signature As an application for electronic commerce, a mobile agent is now used to search for special products or services and is executed for a specific job designated by a customer in the server's environment on behalf of a customer. On the way of performing its role, a mobile agent can be vulnerable to several cryptographic attacks. These attacks can be more serious when done by malicious servers. Among schemes to resolve this problem, the concept of encrypted function for secret computation was proposed in [ST97, KBC00]. However, schemes that employ such encrypted functions enforce the server(host) to execute the functions of customer before verifying the mobile codes even in the case that the codes are maliciously modified. In this paper, we apply proxy signature scheme to the mobile agent system to enhance security and efficiency. Also, we suggest one-time proxy signature scheme to limit the signing power of the server.

Man Multi-Agent Interaction in VR: a Case Study with RoboCup. We describe a Virtual Reality system that allows users at different locations to interact with a multi-agent system in a natural way. We use RoboCup (robot soccer) as a case study. A human player who is immersed in a CAVE can interact with the RoboCup simulation in its natural domain, by playing along with a virtual soccer game. The system supports distributed collaboration by allowing humans at different geographic locations to participate and interact in real time. The most difficult problem we address is how to deal with the latency that is induced by the multi-agent simulation and by the wide-area network between different CAVEs. Our navigation software anticipates the movements of the human player and optimizes the interaction (navigation, kicking). Also, it sends a minimal amount of state information over the wide-area network.  1. Introduction  Multi-agent systems are becoming increasingly important in our society.

In the rst section, we present data on the Internet from several dierent sources, e.g., current as well as projected number of users, hosts and Web sites. Although the numerical gures vary, the overall trends cited by the sources are consistent and point to exponential growth during the coming decade. And Internet users are increasingly using search engines and search services to nd speci c information of interest. However, users are not satis ed with the performance of the current generation of search engines; the slow speed of retrieval, communication delays, and poor quality of retrieved results (e.g., noise and broken links) are commonly cited problems.

A Novel Server Selection Technique for Improving the Response Time of a Replicated Service Server replication is an approach often used to improve the ability of a service to handle a large number of clients. One of the important factors in the efficient utilization of replicated servers is the ability to direct client requests to the best server, according to some optimality criteria. In this paper we target an environment in which servers are distributed across the Internet, and clients identify servers using our application-layer anycasting service. Our goal is to allocate servers to clients in a way that minimizes a client's response time. To that end, we develop an approach for estimating the performance that a client would experience when accessing particular servers. Such information is maintained in a resolver that clients can query to obtain the identity of the server with the best response time. Our performance collection technique combines server push with client probes to estimate the expected response time. A set of experiments is used to demonstrate the propert...

Design of a Classification System for Rectangular Shapes Using a Co-Design Environment Pattern localization and classification are CPU time intensive, being normally implemented in software. Custom implementations in hardware allow real-time processing. In practice, in ASIC or FPGA implementations, the digitization process introduces errors that should be taken into account. This paper presents initially the state-of-the-art in this field, analyzing the performance and implementation of each work. After we propose a system for rectangular shapes localization and classification using reconfigurable devices (FPGA) and a signal processor (DSP) available in a flexible codesign platform. The system will be described using C and VHDL languages, for the software and hardware parts respectively. Finally, it is described the classification block of the system, implemented as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in a rapid prototyping platform.  1.

Exception Handling in the Spreadsheet Paradigm Exception handling is widely regarded as a necessity in programming languages today, and almost every programming language currently used for professional software development supports some form of it. However, spreadsheet systems, which may be the most widely used type of "programming language" today in terms of number of users using it to create "programs" (spreadsheets), have traditionally had only extremely limited support for exception handling. Spreadsheet system users range from end users to professional programmers, and this wide range suggests that an approach to exception handling for spreadsheet systems needs to be compatible with the equational reasoning model of spreadsheet formulas, yet feature expressive power comparable to that found in other programming languages.

Weak Consistency in Distributed Data Warehouses We propose and analyze a novel multiple-view model of a distributed data warehouse. Views are represented in a hierarchical fashion, incorporating data from base sources as well as possibly other views. Current approaches to maintain consistency in such a model require that data stored in a view derived from base data via different paths be from the same state of the base relation. This type of consistency criterion is too restrictive for some applications. Hence, we propose relaxing the synchronization constraints at the view level and develop a model that allows views to set their own constraints by enforcing individual conditions for all pairs of paths. We define a correctness criteria for updates in this particular model, and analyze the new requirements necessary for maintaining the consistency of data. Finally, we propose an algorithm to ensure that views are updated consistently.  Keywords multi-view data warehouse, distributed system, consistency, updates  1 Introduction  A dat...

A Language for Publishing Virtual Documents on the Web The Web is creating exciting new possibilities for direct and instantaneous publishing of information. However, the apparent ease with which one can publish documents on the Web hides more complex issues such updating and maintaining Web pages. We believe one of the crucial requirements to document delivery is the ability to extract and reuse information from other documents or sources. In this paper we present a descriptive language that allows users to write virtual documents, where dynamic information can be retrieved from various sources, transformed, and included along with static information in HTML documents. The language uses a tree-like structure for the representation of information, and defines a database-like query language for extracting and combining information without a complete knowledge of the structure or the types of information. The data structures and the syntax of the language are presented along with examples. 1 Introduction  In recent years the Web has grown fr...

XML Declarative Description: A Language for the Semantic Web this document, you agree to all provisions of the copyright laws protecting it.  a Web resource's semantics. It employs XML as its bare syntax and enhances XML expressive power by employing Declarative Description theory.  8  A description in XDD is a set of ordinary XML elements, extended XML elements with variables, and the XML elements' relationships in terms of XML clauses. An ordinary XML element denotes a semantic unit and is a surrogate of an information item in the real application domain. An extended XML element represents implicit information or a set of semantic units. Clauses express rules, conditional relationships, integrity constraints, and ontological axioms. We define the precise and formal semantics of an XDD description as a set of ordinary XML elements, without employing other formalisms. Important axioms that are missing in XML and RDF but expressible in XDD include  symmetry, composition-of, and inverse  relations. As an example of the inverse-relation axiom, consider the XML clauses A and  B in Figure 1a. They model the Creator  and   PubRAy8"xW  properties' inverses assumed by some particular domain. Figure 1b then gives an example of representing an RDF statement C, "A creator of a document entitled `XDD language' is John." The semantics of an XDD description, which comprises the clauses A, B, and C, will also contain an RDF statement, "A publication of John is `XDD language"' (Figure 1c), hence allowing inverse inference of such implicit information. Obviously, this axiom cannot be represented in RDF. XDD can directly represent all XMLbased application markup languages. It also can simply represent XML applications that provide common conventions of semantics, syntax, and structures for certain specific domains. In addition to RDF, these domai...

Knowing What to Imitate and Knowing When You Succeed If we are to build robots that can imitate the actions of a human instructor, the robotics community must address a variety  of issues.

Query Rewriting using Semistructured Views We address the problem of query rewriting for MSL, a semistructured language developed at Stanford in the TSIMMIS project for information integration. We develop and present an algorithm that, given a semistructured query q and a set of semistructured views V, finds rewriting  queries, i.e., queries that access the views and produce the same result as q. Our algorithm is based on appropriately generalizing containment mappings, the chase, and unification -- techniques which were developed for structured, relational data. At the same time we develop an algorithm for equivalence checking of MSL queries. We show that the rewriting algorithm is sound and complete, i.e., it always finds every conjunctive MSL rewriting query of q, and we discuss its complexity.

Internet Agents for Telemedicine Services Telemedicine can be viewed as the telematic support for collaboration among distant medical professionals, which cooperate on shared resources of various kind. In light of this, attention to telematics and informatics concepts particularly oriented towards collaboration should be paid: in particular, the recently appeared agent paradigm seems suitable for the analysis, design and development of telemedicine services because of its committment to intercommunication and sharing of resources. The present paper is aimed at introducing the agent paradigm, from the theoretical basis up to the technological issues, and at describing an agent-based approach to telemedicine, specifically applied to telepathology applications. The described system is based on an agent-based tool (JAMES), namely an agent model and template implemented using Java, which has been used to implement a prototype multipurpose telepathology application based on a federated agency architecture.

ATLAS: A generic software platform for speech technology based applications ATLAS is a Java software library that provides a framework for building multilingual  and multi-modal applications, especially dialogue systems, on top of speech  technology components. The design is based on a layered system model, where  ATLAS sits as a middleware between an application-dependent layer and the  speech technology components and implements much of application-independent  functionality in the system. ATLAS is itself layered with interfaces to speech  technology components at the bottom and self-contained dialogue components at  the top. The layered design is both efficient and flexible and is suitable for a  research environment. The framework also provides support for applicationdependent  layers through a structure of an application with sessions interacting  with users through terminals. The terminal concept supports creating audio deviceindependent  applications that run transparently in both telephone and desktop  environments. Several speech technology components are available for use with  the ATLAS framework, including text-to-speech, speech recognition and speaker  verification systems. Four applications that use ATLAS have so far been developed  within student and research projects at the Centre for Speech Technology (CTT),  including a speech controlled telephone banking system (CTT-bank) and an  automated entrance receptionist (PER).  1.

Clustering Hypertext With Applications To Web Searching : Clustering separates unrelated documents and groups related documents, and is useful for discrimination, disambiguation, summarization, organization, and navigation of unstructured collections of hypertext documents. We propose a novel clustering algorithm that clusters hypertext documents using words (contained in the document), out-links (from the document) , and in-links (to the document). The algorithm automatically determines the relative importance of words, out-links, and in-links for a given collection of hypertext documents.

These nuggets constitute high-quality information resources that are representatives of the content of the clusters, and are extremely effective in compactly summarizing and navigating the collection of hypertext documents. We employ web searching as an application to illustrate our results. Keywords: cluster annotation, feature comb...

Meaning for Observers and Agents Claude Shannon formalized the notion of information transmission rate and capacity for pre-existing channels. Wittgenstein in his later work insisted that linguistic meaning be defined in terms of use in language games. C. S. Peirce, the father of semiotics, realized the importance of sign, signified, and interpretant in processes of semiosis. In particular, the connection between sign and signified does not take place in a platonic vacuum but is situated, embodied, embedded, and must be mediated by an interpretant. We introduce a rigorous mathematical notion of meaning, as (1) agent- and observer- perceptible information in interaction games between an agent and its environment or between an agent and other agents, that is (2) useful for satisfying homeostatic and other drives, needs, goals or intentions. With this framework it is possible to address issues of sensor- and actuator- design, origins, evolution, and maintenance for biological and artificial systems. Moreover, correspondences between channels of meaning are exploited by biological entities in predicting the behavior or reading the intent of others, as in predator-prey and social interaction. Social learning, imitation, communication of experience also develop and can be developed on this substrate of shared meaning.

Cost-Based Optimization of Decision Support Queries using Transient-Views Next generation decision support applications, besides being capable of processing huge amounts of data, require the ability to integrate and reason over data from multiple, heterogeneous data sources. Often, these data sources differ in a variety of aspects such as their data models, the query languages they support, and their network protocols. Also, typically they are spread over a wide geographical area. The cost of processing decision support queries in such a setting is quite high. However, processing these queries often involves redundancies such as repeated access of same data source and multiple execution of similar processing sequences. Minimizing these redundancies would significantly reduce the query processing cost.

On using degrees of belief in BDI agents : The past few years have seen a rise in the popularity of the use of mentalistic attitudes such as beliefs, desires and intentions to describe intelligent agents. Many of the models which formalise such attitudes do not admit degrees of belief, desire and intention. We see this as an understandable simplification, but as a simplification which means that the resulting systems cannot take account of much of the useful information which helps to guide human reasoning about the world. This paper starts to develop a more sophisticated system based upon an existing formal model of these mental attributes.  1 Introduction  In the past few years there has been a lot of attention given to building formal models of autonomous software agents; pieces of software which operate to some extent independently of human intervention and which therefore may be considered to have their own goals and the ability to determine how to achieve those goals.

From Implicit Skills to Explicit Knowledge: A Bottom-Up Model of Skill Learning This paper presents a skill learning model CLARION. Different from existing models of mostly high-level skill learning that use a top-down approach (that is, turning declarative knowledge into procedural knowledge through practice), we adopt a bottom-up approach toward low-level skill learning, where procedural knowledge develops first and declarative knowledge develops later. Our model is formed by integrating connectionist, reinforcement, and symbolic learning methods to perform on-line reactive learning. It adopts a two-level dual-representation framework (Sun, 1995), with a combination of localist and distributed representation. We compare the model with human data in a minefield navigation task, demonstrating some match between the model and human data in several respects.

An Agent-based Petri Net Model with Application to Seller/Buyer Design in Electronic Commerce Agents are becoming one of the most important topics in distributed and autonomous decentralized systems (ADS), and there are increasing attempts to use agent technologies to develop software systems in electronic commerce. Such systems are complex and there is a pressing need for system modeling techniques to support reliable, maintainable and extensible design. G-Nets are a type of Petri net defined to support modeling of a system as a set of independent and loosely-coupled modules. In this paper, we first introduce an extension of G-Net, agent-based G-Net, as a generic model for agent design. Then new communication mechanisms are introduced to support asynchronous message passing among agents. To illustrate our formal modeling technique is effective for agent modeling in electronic commerce, a pricenegotiation protocol example between buyers and sellers is provided. Finally, by analyzing an ordinary Petri net reduced from our agent-based G-Net models, we conclude that our agent-based G-Net models are L3-live, concurrent and effective for agent communications. 1.

Essex Wizards'99 Team Description : This paper describes the Essex Wizards team participated in the  RoboCup'99 simulator league. It is mainly concentrated on a multi-threaded  implementation of simulated soccer agents to achieve real-time performance.  Simulated robot agents work at three distinct phases: sensing, thinking and  acting. POSIX threads are adopted to implement them concurrently. The issues  of decision-making and co-operation are also addressed.  1. Introduction  In the RoboCup simulator environment, the response time of a soccer agent becomes significantly important since the soccer server operates with 100ms cycles for executing actions and 150ms cycles for providing sensory data [12]. Moreover, auditory sensory data can be received at random intervals. It is vital that each agent has bounded response times. If an action is not generated within 100ms, then the agent will stay idle for that cycle and enemy agents that did act might gain an advantage. On the other hand, if more than one action is generat...

Exploring Dynamic Bayesian Belief Networks for Intelligent Fault Management Systems Systems that are subject to uncertainty in their behaviour are often modelled by Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs). These are probabilistic models of the system in which the independence relations between the variables of interest are represented explicitly. A directed graph is used, in which two nodes are connected by an edge if one is a 'direct cause'  of the other.  However the Bayesian paradigm does not provide any direct means for modelling dynamic systems. There has been a considerable amount of research effort in recent years to address this. This paper reviews these approaches and proposes a new dynamic extension to the BBN.  This paper proceeds to discuss fault management of complex telecommunications and how the dynamic bayesian models can assist in the prediction of faults.  Keywords: dynamic bayesian belief networks, telecommunication networks, fault management, intelligent systems.  1

Item-based Collaborative Filtering Recommendation Algorithms Recommender systems apply knowledge discovery techniques to the problem of making personalized recommendations for information, products or services during a live interaction. These systems, especially the k-nearest neighbor collaborative filtering based ones, are achieving widespread success on the Web. The tremendous growth in the amount of available information and the number of visitors to Web sites in recent years poses some key challenges for recommender systems. These are: producing high quality recommendations, performing many recommendations per second for millions of users and items and achieving high coverage in the face of data sparsity. In traditional collaborative filtering systems the amount of work increases with the number of participants in the system. New recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations, even for very large-scale problems. To address these issues we have explored item-based collaborative filtering techniques. Itembased techniques first analyze the user-item matrix to identify relationships between different items, and then use these relationships to indirectly compute recommendations for users. In this paper we analyze different item-based recommendation generation algorithms. We look into different techniques for computing item-item similarities (e.g., item-item correlation vs. cosine similarities between item vectors) and different techniques for obtaining recommendations from them (e.g., weighted sum vs. regression model). Finally, we experimentally evaluate our results and compare them to the basic k-nearest neighbor approach. Our experiments suggest that item-based algorithms provide dramatically better performance than user-based algorithms, while at the same time providing better quality than the best available user-based algorithms. 1

Probability Based Clustering for Document and User Properties . Information Retrieval systems can be improved by exploiting context information such as user and document features. This article presents a model based on overlapping probabilistic or fuzzy clusters for such features. The model is applied within a fusion method which linearly combines several retrieval systems. The fusion is based on weights for the different retrieval systems which are learned by exploiting relevance feedback information. This calculation can be improved by maintaining a model for each document and user cluster. That way, the optimal retrieval system for each document or user type can be identified and applied. The extension presented in this article allows overlapping, probabilistic clusters of features to further refine the process. 1.

Program Comprehension in Multi-Language Systems This paper presents an approach to program comprehension in multi-language systems. Such systems are characterized by a high amount of source codes in various languages for programming, database definition and job control. Coping with those systems requires the references crossing the language boundaries to be analysed.  Using the EER/GRAL approach to graph-based conceptual modeling, models representing relevant aspects of single language are built and integrated into a common conceptual model. Since conceptual modeling focusses on specific problems, the integrated model presented here is especially tailored to multi-language aspects. Software systems are parsed and represented according to this conceptual model and queried by using a powerful graph query mechanism. This allows multi-language cross references to be easily retrieved.  The multi-language conceptual model and the query facilities have been developed in cooperation with the maintenance programmers at an insurance company w...

Integrating Keyword Search into XML Query Processing Due to the popularity of the XML data format, several query languages for XML have been proposed, specially devised to handle data whose structure is unknown, loose, or absent. While these languages are rich enough to allow for querying the content and structure of an XML document, a varying or unknown structure can make formulating queries a very difficult task. We propose an extension to XML query languages that enables keyword search at the granularity of XML elements, that helps novice users formulate queries, and also yields new optimization opportunities for the query processor. We present an implementation of this extension on top of a commercial RDBMS; we then discuss implementation choices and performance results.

Solving a huge number of similar tasks: a combination of multi-task learning and a hierarchical Bayesian approach In this paper, we propose a machine-learning solution to problems consisting of many similar prediction tasks. Each of the individual tasks has a high risk of overfitting. We combine two types of knowledge transfer between tasks to reduce this risk: multi-task learning and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. Multitask learning is based on the assumption that there exist features typical to the task at hand. To find these features, we train a huge two-layered neural network. Each task has its own output, but shares the weights from the input to the hidden units with all other tasks. In this way a relatively large set of possible explanatory variables (the network inputs) is reduced to a smaller and easier to handle set of features (the hidden units). Given this set of features and after an appropriate scale transformation, we assume that the tasks are exchangeable. This assumption allows for a hierarchical Bayesian analysis in which the hyperparameters can be estimated from the data. Effect...

Modeling and Verifying Multi-Agent Behaviors Using Predicate Transition Nets In a multi-agent system, how agents accomplish a goal task is usually specified by multi-agent plans built from basic actions (e.g. operators) of which the agents are capable. A critical problem with such an approach is how can the designer make sure the plans are reliable. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a formal approach for modeling and analyzing multi-agent behaviors using Predicate/Transition (PrT) nets, a high-level formalism of Petri nets. We construct a multi-agent model by representing agent capabilities as transitions. To verify a multiagent PrT model, we adapt the planning graphs as a compact structure for the reachability analysis. We also demonstrate that, based on the PrT model, whether parallel actions specified in multi-agent plans can be executed in parallel and whether the plans guarantee the achievement of the goal can be verified by analyzing the dependency relations among the transitions.

Learning to Notice: Adaptive Models of Human Operators Agent-based technologies have been used for a number of years to model human operators in complex simulated environments. The BDI agent framework has proven to be particularly suited to this sort of modelling, due to its "natural" composition of beliefs, goals and plans. However one of the weaknesses of the BDI agent model, and many other human operator models (agent-based or otherwise), is its inability to support agent learning. Human operators naturally adapt their behaviour over time, particularly to avoid repeating mistakes. This paper introduces an enhancement to the BDI framework which is based on a descriptive psychological model of decision making called "recognition-primed decision making." This enhancement allows the development of agents that adapt their behaviour in real-time, in the same manner as a person would, providing more realistic human operator models.

A Multiagent Approach for Electronic Travel Planning In the last years, the amount of information stored in Internet has grown exponentially. This article presents a new approach to cooperative problem solving that use the Web as a source of data. The architecture has been designed using two main Artificial Intelligence techniques: Multiagent System design, and problem solving (planning). Both are used to obtain a new architecture that dynamically obtains knowledge from Internet. The system uses two different types of agents: planning agents and web agents. Planning agents pay attention to the user's queries and solve his/her problems at a high level of abstraction; web agents fill in the details obtaining the required information from Internet. Different partial solutions given by the web agents while combined by the planning agent to obtain a detailed solution (or solutions) to the user queries.

An Adaptive Penalty Approach for Constrained Genetic-Algorithm Optimization In this paper we describe a new adaptive penalty approach for handling constraints in genetic algorithm optimization problems. The idea is to start with a relatively small penalty coefficient and then increase it or decrease it on demand as the optimization progresses. Empirical results in several engineering design domains demonstrate the merit of the proposed approach.  1 Introduction  Genetic Algorithms (GAs) (Goldberg 1989) are search algorithms that mimic the behavior of natural selection. GAs attempt to find the best solution to some problem (e.g., the maximum of a function) by generating a collection ("population ") of potential solutions ("individuals") to the problem. Through mutation and recombination (crossover) operations, better solutions are hopefully generated out of the current set of potential solutions. This process continues until an acceptably good solution is found. GAs have many advantages over other search techniques, including the ability to deal with qualitativ...

Connecting Planning And Acting Via Object-Specific Reasoning Instructions from a high-level planner are in general too abstract for a behavioral simulator to execute. In this dissertation I describe an intermediate reasoning system -- the Object-Specific Reasoner -- which bridges the gap between high-level task-actions and action directives of a behavioral system. It decomposes task-actions and derives parameter values for each action directive, thus enabling existing high-level planners to instruct synthetic agents with the same task-action commands that they currently produce. The Object-Specific Reasoner's architecture follows directly from the hypothesis that action representations are underspecified descriptions, and that objects in the same functional category are manipulated in similar ways. The action representation and the object representation are combined to complete the action interpretation, thereby grounding plans in action. The Object-Specific Reasoner provides evidence that a small number of object functional categories, organize...

Learning Behavioral Parameterization Using Spatio-Temporal Case-Based Reasoning This paper presents an approach to learning an optimal behavioral parameterization in the framework of a Case-Based Reasoning methodology for autonomous navigation tasks. It is based on our previous work on a behavior-based robotic system that also employed spario-temporal case-based reasoning [3] in the selection of behavioral parameters but was not capable of learning new parameterizations. The present method extends the case-based reasoning module by making it capable of learning new and optimizing the existing cases where each case is a set of behavioral parameters. The learning process can either be a separate training process or be part of the mission execution. In either case, the robot learns an optimal parameterization of its behavior for different environments it encounters. The goal of this research is not only to automatically optimize the performance of the robot but also to avoid the manual configuration of behavioral parameters and the initial configuration of a case library, both of which require the user to possess good knowledge of robot behavior and the performance of numerous experiments. The presented method was integrated within a hybrid robot architecture and evaluated in extensive computer simulations, showing a significant increase in the performance over a nonadaptive system and a performance comparable to a non-learning CBR system that uses a hand-coded case library.

The Web Graph: an Overview this paper, a study is made on a 200 millions vertices graph obtained from a crawl of the Web, and it appears that is is composed of four parts of equivalent sizes. See Figure 3. The first part is the largest strongly connected component of the graph (the second largest is much smaller), which composes the core of the well connected pages. The second part, called IN, is composed of those pages from which the core is reachable, but which are not reachable from the core. Conversly, the third part, called OUT, is the set of pages reachable from the core but from which the core is unreachable. Finally, the dendrites are the pages reachable from one of the three first parts, or from which one of the three first parts is reachable, but which belong to none of the previous parts. Only ten percent of the whole graph do not belong to one of these four parts which compose the bow-tie

Extreme Programming of Multi-Agent Systems The complexity of communication scenarios between agents make multi-agent systems difficult to build. Most of the existing Agent-Oriented Software Engineering methodologies face this complexity by guiding the developers through a rather waterfall-based process with a series of intermediate modeling artifacts. While these methodologies lead to executable prototypes relatively late and are expensive when requirements change, we explore a rather evolutionary approach with explicit support for change and rapid feedback. In particular, we apply Extreme Programming, a modern light-weight methodology from object-oriented software technology, for the design and implementation of multiagent systems. The only modeling artifacts that are being maintained in our approach are a process model with which domain experts and developers design and communicate agent application scenarios, and the executable agent source code including automated test cases. Our methodology has been successfully applied for the development of a prototypical multi-agent system for clinical information logistics. 1.

Feature selection using Expected Attainable Discrimination We propose expected attainable discrimination (EAD) as a measure to select discrete valued features for reliable discrimination between two classes of data. EAD is an average of the area under the ROC curves obtained when a simple histogram probability density model is trained and tested on many random partitions of a data set. EAD can be incorporated into various stepwise search methods to determine promising subsets of features, particularly when misclassification costs are difficult or impossible to specify. Experimental application to the problem of risk prediction in pregnancy is described.

Spontaneous, Short-term Interaction with Mobile Robots major open research directions in mobile robotics. This paper considers a specific type of interaction: short-term and spontaneous interaction with crowds of people. Such patterns of interactions are found when service robots operate in public places, for example information kiosks, receptionists, tour-guide robots applications. We describe our approach to spontaneous short-term interaction: a robot designed to be a believable social agent. The approach has been implemented using a mobile robot with a motorized face as focal point for interaction, an architecture that suggests the robot has moods, and a method for learning how to interact with people. Our system was recently deployed at a Smithsonian museum in Washington, DC. During a two week period it interacted with thousands of people. The robot's interactive capabilities were essential for its high on-task performance, and thus its practical success.

A Plan Based Agent Architecture for Interpreting Natural Language Dialogue This paper describes a plan-based agent architecture for modeling NL cooperative dialogue; in particular, the paper focuses on the interpretation dialogue and explanation of its coherence by means of the recognition of the speakers' underlying intentions. The approach we propose makes it possible to analyze and explain in a uniform way several apparently unrelated linguistic phenomena, which have been often studied separately and treated via ad-hoc methods in the models of dialogue presented in the literature. Our model of linguistic interaction is based on the idea that dialogue can be seen as any other interaction among agents: therefore, domain-level and linguistic actions are treated in a similar way. Our agent architecture is based on a two-level representation of the knowledge about acting: at the metalevel, the Agent Modeling plans describe the recipes for plan formation and execution (they are a declarative representation of a reactive planner); at the object level, the domain ...

Querying Network Directories Hierarchically structured directories have recently proliferated with the growth of the Internet, and are being used to store not only address books and contact information for people, but also personal pro les, network resource information, and network and service policies. These systems provide a means for managing scale and heterogeneity, while allowing for conceptual unity and autonomy across multiple directory servers in the network, in a way far superior to what conventional relational or object-oriented databases o er. Yet, in deployed systems today, much of the data is modeled in an ad hoc manner, and many of the more sophisticated \queries &quot; involve navigational access. In this paper, we develop the core of a formal data model for network directories, and propose a sequence of e ciently computable query languages with increasing expressive power. The directory data model can naturally represent rich forms of heterogeneity exhibited in the real world. Answers to queries expressible in our query languages can exhibit the same kinds of heterogeneity. We present external memory algorithms for the evaluation of queries posed in our directory query languages, and prove the e ciency of each algorithm in terms of its I/O complexity. Our data model and query languages share the exibility and utility of the recent proposals for semi-structured data models, while at the same time e ectively addressing the speci c needs of network directory applications, which we demonstrate by means of a representative real-life example.

Machine Learning and Knowledge Representation in the LaboUr Approach to User Modeling .

In recent years, however, the application  of machine learning techniques to control user-adapted interaction has become popular. In  this paper, we present and compare adaptive systems that use either knowledge representation  or machine learning for user modeling. Based on this comparison, several dimensions  are identified that can be used to distinguish both approaches, but also to characterize user  modeling systems in general.

Finally, an  implementation of LaboUr ideas into the information server ELFI is sketched.  1 Introduction  While striving to achieve user-adapted interaction, user modeling researchers have often m...

Improving Index Structures for Structured Document Retrieval Structured document retrieval has established itself as a new research area in the overlap between Database Systems and Information Retrieval. This work proposes a filtering technique, that can be added to already existing index structures of many structured document retrieval systems. This new technique takes the contextual structure information of query and document database into account and reduces the occurrence sets returned by the original index structure drastically. This improves the performance of query evaluation.  A measure is introduced that allows to quantify the added value of the proposed index structure. Based on this measure a heuristic is presented that allows to include only valuable context information in the index structure. 1 Introduction  With the growing importance of Information Retrieval in the presence of a vast amount of structured documents in formalisms like SGML ([ISO86]) or the future WWW language XML ([W3C99]), sophisticated and efficient indexing techn...

Eigentaste: A Constant Time Collaborative Filtering Algorithm Abstract. Eigentaste is a collaborative filtering algorithm that uses universal queries to elicit real-valued user ratings on a common set of items and applies principal component analysis (PCA) to the resulting dense subset of the ratings matrix. PCA facilitates dimensionality reduction for offline clustering of users and rapid computation of recommendations. For a database of n users, standard nearest-neighbor techniques require O(n) processing time to compute recommendations, whereas Eigentaste requires O(1) (constant) time. We compare Eigentaste to alternative algorithms using data from Jester, an online joke recommending system. Jester has collected approximately 2,500,000 ratings from 57,000 users. We use the Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) measure to compare performance of different algorithms. In the Appendix we use Uniform and Normal distribution models to derive analytic estimates of NMAE when predictions are random. On the Jester dataset, Eigentaste computes recommendations two orders of magnitude faster with no loss of accuracy. Jester is

Visual Information Retrieval from Large Distributed On-line Repositories ion ---  VIR systems differ in the level of abstraction in  which content is indexed. For example,  images may be indexed at various levels, such  as at the feature-level (e.g., color, texture, and  shape), object-level (e.g., moving foreground  object), syntax-level (e.g., video shot), and  semantic-level (e.g., image subject), and so  forth.

Towards Structural Logistic Regression: Combining Relational and Statistical Learning Inductive logic programming (ILP) techniques are useful for analyzing data in multi-table relational databases. Learned rules can potentially discover relationships that are not obvious in ``flattened'' data. Statistical learners, on the other hand, are generally not constructed to search relational data, they expect to be presented with a single table containing a set of feature candidates. However, statistical learners often yield more accurate models than the logical forms of ILP, and can better handle certain types of data, such as counts. We propose a new approach which integrates structure navigation from ILP with regression modeling. Our approach propositionalizes the first-order rules at each step of ILP's relational structure search, generating features for potential inclusion in a regression model. Ideally, feature generation by ILP and feature selection by stepwise regression should be integrated into a single loop. Preliminary results for scientific literature classification are presented using a relational form of the data extracted by ResearchIndex (formerly CiteSeer). We use FOIL and logistic regression as our ILP and statistical components (decoupled at this stage). Word counts and citation-based features learned with FOIL are modeled together by logistic regression. The combination often significantly improves performance when high precision classification is desired.

Active Disks Several application and technology trends indicate that it might be both profitable and feasible to move computation closer to the data that it processes. In this paper, we evaluate Active Disk architectures which integrate significant processing power and memory into a disk drive and allow application-specific code to be downloaded and executed on the data that is being read from (written to) disk. The key idea is to offload bulk of the processing to the disk-resident processors and to use the host processor primarily for coordination, scheduling and combination of results from individual disks. To program Active Disks, we propose a stream-based programming model which allows disklets to be executed efficiently and safely. Simulation results for a suite of seven algorithms from three application domains (commercial data warehouses, image processing and satellite data processing) indicate that for these algorithms, Active Disks outperform conventional-disk architectures. 1 Introduction...

Intelligent Information Access in the Web: ML based User Modeling for high precision Meta-Search It is a well known fact that high precision search for documents concerning a certain topic in the World Wide Web (Www) is a tough problem. Index based search engines vary in recall (with a coverage of at most 30% of the web) and offer a very bad precision by (simple) keyword search. Meta search engines provide a specialised monolithic architecture for information extraction, and integration of heterogenous information resources which ensures a bigger recall and may yield a better precision. Few search engines (as, e. g., HuskySearch) employ intelligent techniques in order to increase precision. On the other hand, many personalized agents for web browsing are currently developed. It is a straightforward idea to incorporate the idea of user modeling with machine learning (Ml) methods into web search services. We propose an abstract prototype, OySTER, which makes use of machine learning based user modeling and which for reasons of robustness, performance and quality is realised as a mult...

On the Complexity of Terminological Reasoning TBoxes are an important component of knowledge representation systems based on description logics (DLs) since they allow for a natural representation of terminological knowledge. Largely due to a classical result given by Nebel [ 20 ] , complexity analyses for DLs have, until now, mostly focused on reasoning without (acyclic) TBoxes. In this paper, we concentrate on DLs, for which reasoning without TBoxes is  PSpace-complete, and show that there exist logics for which the complexity of reasoning remains in PSpace if acyclic TBoxes are added and also logics for which the complexity increases. An example for a logic of the former type is ALC while examples for logics of the latter kind include ALC(D) and ALCF . This demonstrates that it is necessary to take TBoxes into account for complexity analyses. Furthermore, we show that reasoning with the description logic ALCRP(D)  is NExpTime-complete regardless of whether TBoxes are admitted or not. 1 Introduction  A core feature of description...

Web Search -- Your Way We describe a metasearch engine architecture, in use at NEC Research Institute, that allows users to provide preferences in the form of an information need category. This extra information is used to direct the search process, providing more valuable results than by considering only the query. Using our architecture, identical keyword queries may be sent to different search engines, and results may be scored differently for different users.

Mental States Recognition from Communication  Effective and useful communication requires the agents' being able to foresee the effects of their utterances over the addressee's mental state. However, referring to the classical Speech Act Theory, it seems to us that the idea of predicting such effects is rather optimistic since they are not really completely "a priori" foreseeable by the speaker. Along with some obvious main effects, there are other side effects which might be regarded as the result of some kind of plausible inference, particularly abduction, performed by the hearerhimself79  the received communication and over: - its own actual mental state (which can be differentfromen one expected by the speaker), - its image (may be incorrect and incomplete) ofthe81-24 's mental state.

An Application-Independent Intelligent User Support System Exploiting Action-Sequence Based User Modelling . Many software systems' usability suffers from their complexity, usually caused  by the market-driven trend to bundle a huge amount of features, which are supposed to increase  the product's attractiveness. This attempt, however, more often than not leads to software  with poor usability characteristics, therefore requiring an extensive amount of initial  effort for the users to become familiar with the system. One way to overcome this problem  is by providing user-adapted usage support.  In this paper we present an experimental system for intelligent user support, which has  been developed under the aspect of portability. Focusing on this goal, the system supports a  variety of user- and task-modeling approaches and is independent from the hosting software  application environment, thus being ready to integrate with existing and new applications.  The different user-modeling approaches have been empirically evaluated and compared in  a medical software application embedding our syste...

Scalable Maintenance in Distributed Data Warehousing Environment The maintenance of data warehouses is becoming an increasingly important topic due to the growing  use, derivation and integration of digital information. Most previous work has dealt with one centralized  data warehouse (DW) only. In this paper, we now focus on environments with multiple data warehouses  that are possibly derived from other data warehouses. In such a large-scale environment, data  updates from base sources may arrive in individual data warehouses in different orders, thus resulting  in inconsistent data warehouse extents. We propose a registry-based solution strategy that addresses  this problem by employing a registry agent responsible for establishing one unique order for the propagation  of updates from the base sources to the data warehouses. With this solution, individual data  warehouse managers can still maintain their respective extents autonomously and independently from  each other, thus allowing them to apply any of the existing incremental maintenance algo...

Learning Decision Trees for Loss Minimization in Multi-Class Problems Many machine learning applications require classifiers that minimize an asymmetric loss function rather than the raw misclassification rate. We study methods for modifying C4.5 to incorporate arbitrary loss matrices. One way to incorporate loss information into C4.5 is to manipulate the weights assigned to the examples from different classes. For 2-class problems, this works for any loss matrix, but for k ? 2 classes, it is not sufficient. Nonetheless, we ask what is the set of class weights that best approximates an arbitrary k \Theta k loss matrix, and we test and compare several methods: a wrapper method and some simple heuristics. The best method is a wrapper method that directly optimizes the loss using a hold-out data set. We define complexity measure for loss matrices and show that this measure can predict when more efficient methods will suffice and when the wrapper method must be applied. 1 Introduction  For most of the history of machine learning research, a central goal has ...

Developing Adaptable User Interfaces for Component-based Systems Developing software components with user interfaces that can be adapted to diverse reuse situations is challenging. Examples of such adaptations include extending, composing and reconfiguring multiple component user interfaces, and adapting component user interfaces to particular user preferences, roles and subtasks. We describe our recent work in facilitating such adaptation via the concept of user interface aspects, which facilitate effective component user interface design and realisation using an extended, component-based software architecture.  1. Introduction  Component-based software applications are composed from diverse software components to form an application [1, 14, 16, 17]. Typically many of these components have been developed separately, with no knowledge of the user interfaces of other components they may be composed with. This can result in component-based applications with inappropriate, inconsistent interfaces.  For example, two components with user interfaces that ...

Cyclic Association Rules We study the problem of discovering association rules that display regular cyclic variation over time. For example, if we compute association rules over monthly sales data, we may observe seasonal variation where certain rules are true at approximately the same month each year. Similarly, association rules can also display regular hourly, daily, weekly, etc., variation that is cyclical in nature. We demonstrate that existing methods cannot be naively extended to solve this problem of cyclic association rules. We then present two new algorithms for discovering such rules. The first one, which we call the sequential algorithm, treats association rules and cycles more or less independently. By studying the interaction between association rules and time, we devise a new technique called cycle pruning, which reduces the amount of time needed to find cyclic association rules. The second algorithm, which we call the interleaved algorithm, uses cycle pruning and other optimization techniques f...

Experiments In Information Retrieval From Spoken Documents This paper describes the experiments performed as part of the TREC-97 Spoken Document Retrieval Track. The task was to pick the correct document from 35 hours of recognized speech documents, based on a text query describing exactly one document. Among the experiments we described here are: Vocabulary size experiments to assess the effect of words missing from the speech recognition vocabulary; experiments with speech recognition using a stemmed language model; using confidence annotations that estimate of the correctness of each recognized word; using multiple hypotheses from the recognizer. And finally we also measured the effects of corpus size on the SDR task. Despite fairly high word error rates, information retrieval performance was only slightly degraded for speech recognizer transcribed documents. 1.

Optimizing Learning in Image Retrieval Combining learning with vision techniques in interactive image retrieval has been an active research topic during the past few years. However, existing learning techniques either are based on heuristics or fail to analyze the working conditions. Furthermore, there is almost no in depth study on how to effectively learn from the users when there are multiple visual features in the retrieval system. To address these limitations, in this paper, we present a vigorous optimization formulation of the learning process and solve the problem in a principled way. By using Lagrange multipliers, we have derived explicit solutions, which are both optimal and fast to compute. Extensive comparisons against state-ofthe-art techniques have been performed. Experiments were carried out on a large-size heterogeneous image collection consisting of 17,000 images. Retrieval performance was tested under a wide range of conditions. Various evaluation criteria, including precision-recall curve and rank measure, have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique. 1.

Normalization and matching in the DORO system This paper is concerned with the use of linguistically motivated phrases as indexing terms in Information Retrieval applications. Apart from the conventional noun phrases, we propose to use verb phrases as index terms for text classification. Techniques for phrase matching through syntactic normalization and semantical matching are described. In particular, we show how to perform syntactic normalization of phrases in order to enhance recall. Semantical normalization is based on lexico-semantical relations, taking into account certain properties of the classification algorithms used. The ideas described here are being implemented in the Document Routing system DORO, in which statistical learning algorithms are applied to document profiles consisting of phrases. This paper describes the rationale behind work in progress, rather than presenting final results.

Context-Aware Telephony over WAP . In this paper we introduce a novel approach to share context to enhance the social quality of remote mobile communication. We provide an analysis of how people start a conversation in situations where they meet physically, especially looking on the influence of the situation. Than this is compared to the way remote communication is initiated using mobile phones. The lack of knowledge about the situation on the other end leads to initiation of calls that are not appropriate in the situation. The solution we propose is to exchange context information before initiating the call. We implemented this concept using the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). The WML-based Application Context-Call offers a phone interface that provides information about the receiver when setting up a call. The caller can than decide based on that information to place the call, to leave a message or to cancel the call. Privacy issues that arise from this technology are discussed, too.

Blobworld: Image segmentation using Expectation-Maximization and its application to image querying Abstract√êRetrieving images from large and varied collections using image content as a key is a challenging and important problem. We present a new image representation that provides a transformation from the raw pixel data to a small set of image regions that are coherent in color and texture. This ¬™Blobworld¬∫ representation is created by clustering pixels in a joint color-texture-position feature space. The segmentation algorithm is fully automatic and has been run on a collection of 10,000 natural images. We describe a system that uses the Blobworld representation to retrieve images from this collection. An important aspect of the system is that the user is allowed to view the internal representation of the submitted image and the query results. Similar systems do not offer the user this view into the workings of the system; consequently, query results from these systems can be inexplicable, despite the availability of knobs for adjusting the similarity metrics. By finding image regions that roughly correspond to objects, we allow querying at the level of objects rather than global image properties. We present results indicating that querying for images using Blobworld produces higher precision than does querying using color and texture histograms of the entire image in cases where the image contains distinctive objects. Index Terms√êSegmentation and grouping, image retrieval, image querying, clustering, Expectation-Maximization. 1

Implicit Interest Indicators Recommender systems provide personalized suggestions about  items that users will find interesting. Typically, recommender systems require a user interface that can "intelligently" determine the interest of a user and use this information to make suggestions. The common solution, "explicit ratings", where users tell the system what they think about a piece of information, is well-understood and fairly precise. However, having to stop to enter explicit ratings can alter normal patterns of browsing and reading. A more "intelligent" method is to use implicit ratings, where a rating is obtained by a method other than obtaining it directly from the user. These implicit interest indicators have obvious advantages, including removing the cost of the user rating, and that every user interaction with the system can contribute to an implicit rating.  Current recommender systems mostly do not use implicit ratings, nor is the ability of implicit ratings to predict actual user interest well-unders...

A Model of Collision Perception for Real-Time Animation A model of human visual perception of collisions is presented, based on twodimensional measures of eccentricity and separation. The model is validated by performing psychophysical experiments. We demonstrate the feasibility of using this model as the basis for perceptual scheduling of interruptible collision detection in a realtime animation of large numbers of visually homogeneous objects. The user's point of fixation may be either tracked or estimated. By using a priority queue scheduling algorithm, perceived collision inaccuracy was approximately halved. The ideas presented are applicable to other tasks where the processing of fine detail leads to a computational bottleneck.

A Hierarchical Approach to Wrapper Induction With the tremendous amount of information that becomes available on the Web on a daily basis, the ability to quickly develop information agents has become a crucial problem. A vital component of any Web-based information agent is a set of wrappers that can extract the relevant data from semistructured information sources. Our novel approach to wrapper induction is based on the idea of hierarchical information extraction, which turns the hard problem of extracting data from an arbitrarily complex document into a series of easier extraction tasks. We introduce an inductive algorithm, stalker, that generates high accuracy extraction rules based on user-labeled training examples. Labeling the training data represents the major bottleneck in using wrapper induction techniques, and our experimental results show that stalker does significantly better then other approaches; on one hand, stalker requires up to two orders of magnitude fewer examples than other algorithms, while on the other hand...

Evolution of a Central Pattern Generator for the Swimming and Trotting Gaits of the Salamander This paper presents the development of neural controllers for the swimming and the trotting of a salamanderlike animat. Using a genetic algorithm (GA), we extend a connectionist model of the central pattern generator (CPG) controlling the swimming of a lamprey [1] to control the locomotion of a 2D mechanical simulation of a salamander. We study in particular what kind of neural connectivity can produce the traveling undulation of the trunk during swimming and the standing S-wave undulation during trotting. Using a GA, we evolve neural controllers which are made of two segmental oscillators controlling the fore- and hindlimb muscles, which project to a lamprey-like CPG for the trunk muscles. CPGs are successfully evolved which exhibit the swimming gait when external excitatory drive is applied only to the trunk CPG, and the trotting gait when external drive is applied to both the limb and the trunk CPGs. For both types of gaits, the speed of locomotion can be varied with the amplitude o...

Results on Reasoning about Updates in Transaction Logic . Transaction Logic was designed as a general logic of state change for deductive databases and logic programs. It has a model theory, a proof theory, and its Horn subset can be given a procedural interpretation. Previous work has demonstrated that the combination of declarative semantics and procedural interpretation turns the Horn subset of Transaction Logic into a powerful language for logic programming with updates [BK98,BK94,BK93,BK95]. In this paper, we focus not on the Horn subset, but on the full logic, and we explore its potential as a formalism for reasoning about logic programs with updates. We first develop a methodology for specifying properties of such programs, and then provide a sound inference system for reasoning about them, and conjecture a completeness result. Finally, we illustrate the power of the inference system through a series of examples of increasing difficulty. 1 Introduction  Updates are a crucial component of any database programming language.

Expert System Technology in Observing Tools Over the past two years, the Scientist's Expert Assistant team from NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and the Space Telescope Science Institute has been prototyping tools to support General Observer proposal development for the Hubble Space Telescope and the Next Generation Space Telescope. One aspect of this effort has been the exploration of the use of expert systems in guiding the user in preparing their observing program. The initial goal was to provide the user with a question-and-answer style of interaction where the software would "interview" the user for their science needs and recommend instrument settings. This design ultimately failed. The reasons for this failure, and the resulting evolution of our approach, are an interesting case study in the use of expert system technology for observing tools. Although the interview approach failed we felt that expert systems can still be used in the tools environment. This paper describes our current approach to the use of expert syste...

BDI Design Principles and Cooperative Implementation - A Report on RoboCup Agents This report discusses two major views on BDI deliberation for autonomous agents. The first view is a rather conceptual one, presenting general BDI design principles, namely heuristic options, decomposed reasoning and layered planning, which enable BDI deliberation in realtime domains. The second view is focused on the practical application of the design principles in RoboCup Simulation League. This application not only evaluates the usefulness in deliberation but also the usefulness in rapid cooperative implementation. We compare this new approach, which has been used in the Vice World Champion team AT Humboldt 98, to the old approach of AT Humboldt 97, and we outline the extensions for AT Humboldt 99, which are still under work. Conditions faced by deliberation in multi agent contexts differ significantly from the basic assumption of classical AI search and planning.

The FERET Evaluation Methodology for Face-Recognition Algorithms Two of the most critical requirements in support of producing reliable face-recognition systems are a large database of facial images and a testing procedure to evaluate systems. The Face Recognition Technology (FERET) program has addressed both issues through the FERET database of facial images and the establishment of the FERET tests. To date, 14,126 images from 1199 individuals are included in the FERET database, which is divided into development and sequestered portions of the database. In September 1996, the FERET program administered the third in a series of FERET face-recognition tests.

Modeling and optimizing I/O throughput of multiple disks on a bus In modern I/O architectures, multiple disk drives are attached to each I/O controller. A study of the performance of such architectures under I/O-intensive workloads has revealed a performance impairment that results from a previously unknown form of convoy behavior in disk I/O. In this paper, we describe measurements of the read performance of multiple disks that share a SCSI bus under a heavy workload, and develop and validate formulas that accurately characterize the observed performance (to within 12 % on several platforms for I/O sizes in the range 16{128 KB). Two terms in the formula clearly characterize the lost performance seen in our experiments. We describe techniques to deal with the performance impairment, via user-level workarounds that achieve greater overlap of bus transfers with disk seeks, and that increase the percentage of transfers that occur at the full bus bandwidth rather than at the lower bandwidth of a disk head. Experiments show bandwidth improvements of 10-20 % when using these user-level techniques, but only in the case of large I/Os.

Web-Document Prediction And Presending Using Association Rule Sequential Classifiers An important data source for data mining is the web-log data that traces the user's web browsing actions. From the web logs, one can build prediction models that predict with high accuracy the user's next requests based on past behavior. To do this with the traditional classification and association rule methods will cause a number of serious problems due to the extremely large data size and the rich domain knowledge that must be applied. Most web log data are sequential in nature and exhibit the "most recent--most important" behavior. To overcome this difficulty, we examine two important dimensions of building prediction models, namely the type of antecedents of rules and the criterion for selecting prediction rules. This thesis proposes a better overall method for prediction model representation and refinement. We show empirically on realistic web log data that the proposed model dramatically outperforms previous ones. How to apply the learned prediction model to the task of presending web documents is also demonstrated.  iv  Dedication  To MY MOTHER only v  Acknowledgments  I would like to thank my senior supervisor, Dr. Qiang Yang, for his guidance, encouragement and invaluable advice during my research.

Analyzing Web Robots and Their Impact on Caching Understanding the nature and the characteristics of Web robots is an essential step to analyze their impact on caching. Using a multi-layer hierarchical workload model, this paper presents a characterization of the workload generated by autonomous agents and robots. This characterization focuses on the statistical properties of the arrival process and on the robot behavior graph model. A set of criteria is proposed for identifying robots in real logs. We then identify and characterize robots from real logs applying a multi-layered approach. Using a stack distance based analytical model for the interaction between robots and Web site caching, we assess the impact of robots' requests on Web caches. Our analyses point out that robots cause a significant increase in the miss ratio of a server-side cache. Robots have a referencing pattern that completely disrupts locality assumptions. These results indicate not only the need for a better understanding of the behavior of robots, but also the need of Web caching policies that treat robots' requests differently than human generated requests.

Joint Optimization of Cost and Coverage of Query Plans in Data Integration Existing approaches for optimizing queries in data integration use decoupled strategies--attempting to optimize coverage and cost in two separate phases. Since sources tend to have a variety of access limitations, such phased optimization of cost and coverage can unfortunately lead to expensive planning as well as highly inefficient plans. In this paper we present techniques for joint optimization of cost and coverage of the query plans. Our algorithms search in the space of parallel query plans that support multiple sources for each subgoal conjunct. The refinement of the partial plans takes into account the potential parallelism between source calls, and the binding compatibilities between the sources included in the plan. We start by introducing and motivating our query plan representation. We then briefly review how to compute the cost and coverage of a parallel plan. Next, we provide both a System-R style query optimization algorithm as well as a greedy local search algorithm for searching in the space of such query plans. Finally we present a simulation study that demonstrates that the plans generated by our approach will be significantly better, both in terms of planning cost, and in terms of plan execution cost, compared to the existing approaches.  1.

Self Bounding Learning Algorithms Most of the work which attempts to give bounds on the generalization error of the hypothesis generated by a learning algorithm is based on methods from the theory of uniform convergence. These bounds are a-priori bounds that hold for any distribution of examples and are calculated before any data is observed. In this paper we propose a different approach for bounding the generalization error after the data has been observed. A self-bounding learning algorithm is an algorithm which, in addition to the hypothesis that it outputs, outputs a reliable upper bound on the generalization error of this hypothesis. We first explore the idea in the statistical query learning framework of Kearns [10]. After that we give an explicit self bounding algorithm for learning algorithms that are based on local search. 1 INTRODUCTION Most of the work on the sample complexity of learning is based on uniform convergence theory and attempts to give uniform a-priori bounds.

Multifaceted Object Modeling with Roles: A Comprehensive Approach In conventional object-oriented (O-O) database systems, it is assumed silently that fundamental object types and inter-object relationships can be classfied statically, prescribing basic structural and behavioral properties for all the objects in the database. Such a classification-based approach falls short of supporting emerging data-intensive applications requiring more advanced dynamic capabilities. One of such advanced capabilities is the support of modeling subjectivity -- the ability to (among others) provide multiple perspectives of application objects or to model socalled "multifaceted objects" which, on different stages, can exhibit different forms and behavior. This article describes an extended O-O approach that we have been investigating for this purpose. Advanced features embodied by dynamic and versatile role facilities have been introduced into a conventional object-oriented model, which facilitates specifying and modeling such applications in a natural, incremental and...

Several such information exchange and expert finding services have already been implemented. The problem of current approaches is, that they are not able to exchange data with each other.

Active Storage for Large-Scale Data Mining and Multimedia The increasing performance and decreasing cost of processors and memory are causing system intelligence to move into peripherals from the CPU. Storage system designers are using this trend toward ‚Äúexcess ‚Äù compute power to perform more complex processing and optimizations inside storage devices. To date, such optimiza-tions have been at relatively low levels of the stor-age protocol. At the same time, trends in storage density, mechanics, and electronics are eliminat-ing the bottleneck in moving data off the media and putting pressure on interconnects and host processors to move data more efficiently. We pro-pose a system called Active Disks that takes advantage of processing power on individual disk drives to run application-level code. Moving por-tions of an application‚Äôs processing to execute directly at disk drives can dramatically reduce data traffic and take advantage of the storage par-allelism already present in large systems today. We discuss several types of applications that would benefit from this capability with a focus on the areas of database, data mining, and multime-dia. We develop an analytical model of the speed-ups possible for scan-intensive applications in an Active Disk system. We also experiment with a prototype Active Disk system using relatively low-powered processors in comparison to a data-base server system with a single, fast processor. Our experiments validate the intuition in our model and demonstrate speedups of 2x on 10 disks across four scan-based applications. The model promises linear speedups in disk arrays of hundreds of disks, provided the application data is large enough.

Efficient OLAP Operations in SPatial Data Warehouses Abstract. Spatial databases store information about the position of individual objects in space. In many applications however, such as traffic supervision or mobile communications, only summarized data, like the number of cars in an area or phones serviced by a cell, is required. Although this information can be obtained from transactional spatial databases, its computation is expensive, rendering online processing inapplicable. Driven by the non-spatial paradigm, spatial data warehouses can be constructed to accelerate spatial OLAP operations. In this paper we consider the star-schema and we focus on the spatial dimensions. Unlike the non-spatial case, the groupings and the hierarchies can be numerous and unknown at design time, therefore the wellknown materialization techniques are not directly applicable. In order to address this problem, we construct an ad-hoc grouping hierarchy based on the spatial index at the finest spatial granularity. We incorporate this hierarchy in the lattice model and present efficient methods to process arbitrary aggregations. We finally extend our technique to moving objects by employing incremental update methods. 1

Analog Neural Nets with Gaussian or other Common Noise Distributions cannot Recognize Arbitrary Regular Languages We consider recurrent analog neural nets where the output of each gate is subject to Gaussian noise, or any other common noise distribution that is nonzero on a large set. We show that many regular languages cannot be recognized by networks of this type, and we give a precise characterization of those languages which can be recognized. This result implies severe constraints on possibilities for constructing recurrent analog neural nets that are robust against realistic types of analog noise. On the other hand we present a method for constructing feedforward analog neural nets that are robust with regard to analog noise of this type. 1 Introduction  A fairly large literature (see [Omlin, Giles, 1996] and the references therein) is devoted to the construction of analog neural nets that recognize regular languages. Any physical realization of the analog computational units of an analog neural net in technological or biological systems is bound to encounter some form of "imprecision" or an...

Using Diagnosis to Learn Contextual Coordination Rules Knowing when and how to communicate and coordinate with other agents in a multi-agent system is an important efficiency and reliability question. Contextual rules governing this communication must be provided to the agent, or generated at runtime through environmental analysis. In this paper we describe how the TAEMS task modeling language is used to encode such contextual coordination rules, and how runtime diagnosis can be used to dynamically update them. Overview  Communication and coordination is an essential component of most complex multi-agent systems. Contention over shared resources, the desire to employ remote information and the need to coordinate interrelated activities may each require some sort of information transfer between agents to be resolved. To this end, individual actors in a multi-agent system must be able to explicitly or implicitly communicate requests and results, desires and beliefs, to make the system an efficient and cohesive unit. Thus, a set of situation-...

Self-Organization and Identification of Web Communities The vast improvement in information access is not the only advantage resulting from the increasing percentage of hyperlinked human knowledge available on the Web. Additionally, much potential exists for analyzing interests and relationships within science and society. However, the Web's decentralized and unorganized nature hampers content analysis. Millions of individuals operating independently and having a variety of backgrounds, knowledge, goals and cultures author the information on the Web. Despite the Web's decentralized, unorganized, and heterogeneous nature, our work shows that the Web self-organizes and its link structure allows efficient identification of communities. This self-organization is significant because no central authority or process governs the formation and structure of hyperlinks.

Constrained Genetic Algorithms and their Applications in Nonlinear Constrained Optimization This chapter presents a framework that unifies various search mechanisms for solving constrained nonlinear programming (NLP) problems. These problems are characterized by functions that are not necessarily differentiable and continuous. Our proposed framework is based on the first-order necessary and sufficient condition developed for constrained local minimization in discrete space that shows the equivalence between discrete-neighborhood saddle points and constrained local minima. To look for discrete-neighborhood saddle points, we formulate a discrete constrained NLP in an augmented Lagrangian function and study various mechanisms for performing ascents of the augmented function in the original-variable subspace and descents in the Lagrange-multiplier subspace. Our results show that CSAGA, a combined constrained simulated annealing and genetic algorithm, performs well when using crossovers, mutations, and annealing to generate trial points. Finally, we apply iterative deepening to de...

Declarative Semantics of Belief Queries in MLS Deductive Databases (Extended Abstract) A logic based language, called MultiLog, for multi level secure relational databases has recently been proposed. It has been shown that MultiLog is capable of capturing the notion of user belief, of ltering unwanted and \useless" information in its proof theory. Additionally, it can guard against a previously unknown security breach { the so called surprise stories. In this paper, we outline a possible approach to a declarative characterization of belief queries in MultiLog in a very informal manner. We show that for \simple programs" with belief queries, the semantics is rather straight forward. Semantics for the general Horn programs may be developed based on the understanding of the model theoretic characterization of belief queries developed in this paper.  Keywords: Multi level security, belief queries, declarative semantics, completeness.  Introduction  In a recent research, Jukic and Vrbsky [8] demonstrate that users in the relational MLS model potentially have a cluttered view...

Efficient Identification of Web Communities We dene a community on the web as a set of sites that have more links (in either direction) to members of the community than to non-members. Members of such a community can be eciently identied in a maximum ow / minimum cut framework, where the source is composed of known members, and the sink consists of well-known non-members. A focused crawler that crawls to a xed depth can approximate community membership by augmenting the graph induced by the crawl with links to a virtual sink node. The effectiveness of the approximation algorithm is demonstrated with several crawl results that identify hubs, authorities, web rings, and other link topologies that are useful but not easily categorized. Applications of our approach include focused crawlers and search engines, automatic population of portal categories, and improved ltering.

Partially labeled classification with Markov random walks To classify a large number of unlabeled examples we combine a limited number of labeled examples with a Markov random walk representation over the unlabeled examples. The random walk representation exploits any low dimensional structure in the data in a robust, probabilistic manner. We develop and compare several estimation criteria/algorithms suited to this representation. This includes in particular multi-way classification with an average margin criterion which permits a closed form solution. The time scale of the random walk regularizes the representation and can be set through a margin-based criterion favoring unambiguous classification. We also extend this basic regularization by adapting time scales for individual examples. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic examples and on text classification problems.

Sequence Mining in Categorical Domains: Incorporating Constraints We present cSPADE, an efficient algorithm for mining frequent sequences considering a variety of syntactic constraints. These take the form of length or width limitations on the sequences, minimum or maximum gap constraints on consecutive sequence elements, applying a time window on allowable sequences, incorporating item constraints, and finding sequences predictive of one or more classes, even rare ones. Our method is efficient and scalable. Experiments on a number of synthetic and real databases show the utility and performance of considering such constraints on the set of mined sequences. 1.

Fjording the Stream: An Architecture for Queries over Streaming Sensor Data If  industry  visionaries are correct, our lives will soon be full of sensors, connected together in loose conglomerations via wireless networks, each monitoring and collecting data about the environment at large. These sensors behave  very differently  from traditional database sources:  they  have intermittent connectivity  , are limited  by  severe power constraints, and  ty pically  sample  periodically  and push immediately , keeping no record of historical information. These limitations make traditional database sy tems inappropriate for queries over sensors. We present the Fjords architecture for managing multiple queries over  many  sensors, and show how it can be used to limit sensor resource demands while maintaining high  query  throughput. We evaluate our architecture using traces from a network of traffic sensors deployM on Interstate 80 near  Berkeley  and present performance results that show how  query  throughput, communication costs, and power consumption are  necessarily  coupled in sensor environments.

Decentralized Incremental Maintenance of Multi-View Data Warehouses (Extended Abstract) )  I. Stanoi D. Agrawal A. El Abbadi Department of Computer Science, University of California Santa Barbara, CA 93106 1 Introduction  Decision support systems make up a big percentage of data base servers. Presently, their size increases due to the necessity of more detailed information, and the extended time range of interest. As a result, data mining queries also span larger sets of data. To achieve fast response time, a subset of the relevant information is sometimes materialized in views, separate from the database sources [4]. A data warehouse is an example of storage that integrates information from multiple sources, which may be stand-alone databases as well as sites such as the Internet. Although data warehousing is a powerful concept for supporting analytical processing, building a data warehouse runs into several pragmatic problems. The cost of building a data warehouse that integrates disparate data sources in an organization can easily exceed millions of dollars. A more sev...

Categorisation by Context Assistance in retrieving of documents on the World Wide Web is provided either by search  engines, through keyword based queries, or by catalogues, which organise documents into  hierarchical collections. Maintaining catalogues manually is becoming increasingly difficult  due to the sheer amount of material, and therefore it will be necessary to resort to  techniques for automatic classification of documents. Classification is traditionally  performed by extracting information for indexing a document from the document itself. The  paper describes the technique of categorisation by context, which exploits the context  perceivable from the structure of HTML documents to extract useful information for  classifying the documents they refer to. We present the results of experiments with a  preliminary implementation of the technique.  1.

We present a program that efficiently computes such barrier trees, and apply it to two well known examples of landscapes.

The Diagnosis Frontend of the dlv System This paper presents the Diagnosis Frontend of dlv, which is a knowledge representation system under development at the Technische Universit√§t Wien. The kernel language of the system is an extension of disjunctive logic programming (DLP) by integrity constraints; it offers frontends to several advanced knowledge representation formalisms. The formal model of diagnosis employed in the frontend includes both abductive diagnosis (over DLP theories) and consistency-based diagnosis. For each of the two diagnosis modalities, generic diagnoses, single error diagnoses, and subset minimal diagnoses are considered. We illustrate the use of the frontend by showing the dlv encodings of several diagnosis problems. Thereafter, we discuss implementation issues. Diagnostic reasoning is implemented on the dlv engine through suitable translations of diagnostic problems into disjunctive logic programs, such that their stable models correspond to diagnoses. For the six kinds of diagnostic reasoning problems emerging from above, such reductions are provided

A Feature-Relevance Heuristic for Indexing and Compressing Large Case Bases . This paper reports results with igtree, a formalism for indexing and compressing large case bases in Instance-Based Learning (ibl) and other lazy-learning techniques. The concept of information gain (entropy minimisation) is used as a heuristic feature-relevance function for performing the compression of the case base into a tree. igtree reduces storage requirements and the time required to compute classifications considerably for problems where current ibl approaches fail for complexity reasons. Moreover, generalisation accuracy is often similar, for the tasks studied, to that obtained with information-gain-weighted variants of lazy learning, and alternative approaches such as c4.5. Although  igtree was designed for a specific class of problems --linguistic disambiguation problems with symbolic (nominal) features, huge case bases, and a complex interaction between (sub)regularities and exceptions-- we show in this paper that the approach has a wider applicability when generalising i...

Providing Integrated Toolkit-Level Support for Ambiguity in Recognition-Based Interfaces Recognition technologies are being used extensively in both the commercial and research worlds. But recognizers are still error-prone, and this results in performance problems and brittle dialogues. These problems are a barrier to acceptance and usefulness of recognition systems. Better interfaces to recognition systems, which can help to reduce the burden of recognition errors, are difficult to build because of lack of knowledge about the ambiguity inherent in recognition. We have extended a user interface toolkit in order to model and to provide structured support for ambiguity at the input event level [7]. This makes it possible to build re-usable interface components for resolving ambiguity and dealing with recognition errors. These interfaces can help to reduce the negative effects of recognition errors. By providing these components at a toolkit level, we make it easier for application writers to provide good support for error handling. And we can explore new types of interfaces for resolving a more varied range of ambiguity.

D'Agents: Applications and Performance of a Mobile-Agent System D'Agents is a general-purpose mobile-agent system that has been used in several informationretrieval  applications. In this paper, we  rst examine one such application, operational support  for military  eld personnel, where D'Agents greatly simpli  es the task of providing ecient,  application-speci  c access to remote information resources. After describing the application, we  discuss the key dierences between D'Agents and most other mobile-agent systems, notably its  support for strong mobility and multiple agent languages. Finally, we derive a small, simple  application that is representative of many information-retrieval tasks, including those in the  example application, and use this application to compare the scalability of mobile agents and  traditional client/server approaches. The results con  rm and quantify the usefulness of mobile  code, and perhaps more importantly, con  rm that intuition about when to use mobile code is  usually correct. Although signi  cant additional experiments are needed to fully characterize the  complex mobile-agent performance space, the results here help answer the basic question of when  mobile agents should be considered at all, particularly for information-retrieval applications.

C4-1: Building a community hierarchy for the Web based on Bipartite Graphs In this paper we propose an approach to extract and relate the communities by considering a community signature as a group of content creators that manifests itself as a set of interlinked pages. We abstract a community signature as a group of pages that form a dense bipartite graph (DBG), and proposed an algorithm to extract the DBGs from the given data set. Also, using the proposed approach, the extracted communities can be grouped to form a high-level communities. We apply the proposed algorithm on 10 GB TREC (Text REtrieval Conference) data set and extract a three-level community hierarchy. The extracted community hierarchy facilitates an easy analysis of low-level communities and provides a way to understand the sociology of the Web.

Macroscopic Observation of Multi-Robot Behavior : This paper presents a new approach to the observation and the control of the behavior of multiple autonomous robots. It is the microscopic observation expressed by dynamic equations that has been commonly employed to observe the multi-robot behavior. However, the approach has the difficulties in estimating the behavior and the mutual interactions of robots. Furthermore, it is hard to realize the system by checking up all the factors of the system. It seems that a macroscopic observation defined by state equations is efficient for recognizing the multiple robots behavior. Therefore, we would like to propose a quantitative observation approach. This attempt means the application of the thermodynamic macroscopic state values to the multi-robot systems. The advantage of this approach is that it enables us to observe the behavior of autonomous robots in real world by mapping the characteristic values of them in another conceptual state space.

Requirements for a Translation between Knowledge-level Messages and the Database Structure This paper discusses the requirements of a translator between queries and assertions based on database-independent conceptualizations and their equivalents in the terms of the database structure. To cope with a large number of independent developers of software components that will have to access these databases, and who have different backgrounds and expertise, this translator will allow for several conceptualizations and vocabularies to coexist. It will be possible to individually customize these conceptualizations to keep them simple, concise, and well-aligned to the conceptualizations and jargon used by the domain experts. The translator will be accessed by other software components of the CRISTAL system that have to execute complex queries, like the Viewpoint Facility, user-supplied components ("User Code"), and the so-called ICIST GUI [6]. Schema-independent updates are most relevant for the user-supplied components.

Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies An important question in neuroevolution is how to gain an advantage from evolving neural network topologies along with weights. We present a method, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), which outperforms the best fixed-topology method on a challenging benchmark reinforcement learning task. We claim that the increased efficiency is due to (1) employing a principled method of crossover of different topologies, (2) protecting structural innovation using speciation, and (3) incrementally growing from minimal structure. We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is significantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.

Communication in Reactive Multiagent Robotic Systems Abstract. Multiple cooperating robots are able to complete many tasks more quickly and reliably than one robot alone. Communication between the robots can multiply their capabilities and e ectiveness, but to what extent? In this research, the importance of communication in robotic societies is investigated through experiments on both simulated and real robots. Performance was measured for three di erent types of communication for three di erent tasks. The levels of communication are progressively more complex and potentially more expensive to implement. For some tasks, communication can signi cantly improve performance, but for others inter-agent communication is apparently unnecessary. In cases where communication helps, the lowest level of communication is almost as e ective as the more complex type. The bulk of these results are derived from thousands of simulations run with randomly generated initial conditions. The simulation results help determine appropriate parameters for the reactive control system which was ported for tests on Denning mobile robots.

Meta-Data Based Mediator Generation Mediators are a critical component of any data warehouse; they transform data from source formats to the warehouse representation while resolving semantic and syntactic conflicts. The close relationship between mediators and databases requires a mediator to be updated whenever an associated schema is modified. Failure to quickly perform these updates significantly reduces the reliability of the warehouse because queries do not have access to the most current data. This may result in incorrect or misleading responses, and reduce user confidence in the warehouse. Unfortunately, this maintenance may be a significant undertaking if a warehouse integrates several dynamic data sources. This paper describes a meta-data framework, and associated software, designed to automate a significant portion of the mediator generation task and thereby reduce the effort involved in adapting to schema changes.

Adaptive information extraction: Core technologies for information agents Introduction  For the purposes of this chapter, an information agent can be described as a distributed system that receives a goal through its user interface, gathers information relevant to this goal from a variety of sources, processes this content as appropriate, and delivers the results to the users. We focus on the second stage in this generic architecture. We survey a variety of information extraction techniques that enable information agents to automatically gather information from heterogeneous sources.  For example, consider an agent that mediates package-delivery requests. To satisfy such requests, the agent might need to retrieve address information from geographic services, ask an advertising service for freight forwarders that serve the destination, request quotes from the relevant freight forwarders, retrieve duties and legal constraints from government sites, get weather information to estimate transportation delays, etc.  Information extraction (IE) is a form of sh

Wrapper Induction: Efficiency and Expressiveness The Internet presents numerous sources of useful information---telephone directories, product catalogs, stock quotes, event listings, etc. Recently, many systems have been built that automatically gather and manipulate such information on a user's behalf. However, these resources are usually formatted for use by people (e.g., the relevant content is embedded in HTML pages), so extracting their content is difficult. Most systems use customized wrapper procedures to perform this extraction task. Unfortunately, writing wrappers is tedious and error-prone. As an alternative, we advocate wrapper induction, a technique for automatically constructing wrappers. In this article, we describe six wrapper classes, and use a combination of empirical and analytical techniques to evaluate the computational tradeoffs among them. We first consider expressiveness: how well the classes can handle actual Internet resources, and the extent to which wrappers in one class can mimic those in another. We then...

Our goal is to embed our categorization technique into information retrieval (IR) systems to facilitate the end-users' search task.

The KB contains a set of characteristic keywords with weights by category, and is automatically generated from training texts. With the keyword-based approach, the algorithms to extract keywords and assign weights to them should be considered, because the algorithms affect strongly both categorization accuracy and processing speed. Furthermore, we must take two characteristics of Web pages into account: (1) the text length is very variable, which makes it harder to use statistics such as word frequency to calculate keyword weights, and (2) a huge number of distinct words are used, which makes the KB bigger and therefore pro...

Using Semantic Networks for Knowledge Representation in an Intelligent Environment Introduction  For many years now, research in intelligent spaces has grown, exploring different ways that a room can react to one or more users and their actions. As usage of these intelligent environments (IEs) grows, however, they will by necessity collect ever-increasing amounts of data about their users, in order to adapt to the user's desires. Information will be collected on the users' interests, who they communicate with, their location, web pages they visit, and numerous other details that we may not even notice. All this information needs to be collected and organized, so that the IE can make quick, correct assumptions about what the user would like to do next.  At the Intelligent Room project (Hanssens et al., 2002), we are beginning to define one such knowledge representation  (KR), using semantic networks as the basis for the representation. This creates inherent advantages, both in ease of adding and changing information as well as inference generation.  2. Knowledge Repre

Meta-Agent Programs There are numerous applications where an agent a needs to reason about the beliefs of another agent, as well as about the actions that other agents may take. In (21) the concept of an agent program is introduced, and a language within which the operating principles of an agent can be declaratively encoded on top of imperative data structures is dened. In this paper we rst introduce certain belief data structures that an agent needs to maintain. Then we introduce the concept of a Meta Agent Program (map), that extends the framework of (21; 19), so as to allow agents to perform metareasoning. We build a formal semantics for maps, and show how this semantics supports not just beliefs agent a may have about agent b's state, but also beliefs about agents b's beliefs about agent c's actions, beliefs about b's beliefs about agent c's state, and so on. Finally, we provide a translation that takes any map as input and converts it into an agent program such that there is a one-one correspondence between the semantics of the map and the semantics of the resulting agent program. This correspondence allows an implementation of maps to be built on top of an implementation of agent programs.

Temporal Dependencies Generalized for Spatial and Other Dimensions . Recently, there has been a lot of interest in temporal granularity  , and its applications in temporal dependency theory and data mining. Generalization hierarchies used in multi-dimensional databases and OLAP serve a role similar to that of time granularity in temporal databases, but they also apply to non-temporal dimensions, like space. In this paper, we first generalize temporal functional dependencies for non-temporal dimensions, which leads to the notion of roll-up dependency (RUD). We show the applicability of RUDs in conceptual modeling and data mining. We then indicate that the notion of time granularity used in temporal databases is generally more expressive than the generalization hierarchies in multi-dimensional databases, and show how this surplus expressiveness can be introduced in non-temporal dimensions, which leads to the formalism of RUD with negation (RUD  :  ). A complete axiomatization for reasoning about RUD  :  is given. 1 Introduction  Generalization hierarchi...

Intelligent Information Triage In many applications, large volumes of time-sensitive textual information require triage: rapid, approximate prioritization for subsequent action. In this paper, we explore the use of prospective indications of the importance of a time-sensitive document, for the purpose of producing better document filtering or ranking. By prospective, we mean importance that could be assessed by actions that occur in the future. For example, a news story may be assessed (retrospectively) as being important, based on events that occurred after the story appeared, such as a stock price plummeting or the issuance of many follow-up stories. If a system could anticipate (prospectively) such occurrences, it could provide a timely indication of importance. Clearly, perfect prescience is impossible. However, sometimes there is sufficient correlation between the content of an information item and the events that occur subsequently. We describe a process for creating and evaluating approximate information-triage procedures that are based on prospective indications. Unlike many informationretrieval applications for which document labeling is a laborious, manual process, for many prospective criteria it is possible to build very large, labeled, training corpora automatically. Such corpora can be used to train text classification procedures that will predict the (prospective) importance of each document. This paper illustrates the process with two case studies, demonstrating the ability to predict whether a news story will be followed by many, very similar news stories, and also whether the stock price of one or more companies associated with a news story will move significantly following the appearance of that story. We conclude by discussing how the comprehensibility of the learned classifiers can be critical to success. 1.

Off-policy temporal-difference learning with function approximation We introduce the first algorithm for off-policy temporal-difference learning that is stable with linear function approximation. Off-policy learning is of interest because it forms the basis for popular reinforcement learning methods such as Q-learning, which has been known to diverge with linear function approximation, and because it is critical to the practical utility of multi-scale, multi-goal, learning frameworks such as options, HAMs, and MAXQ. Our new algorithm combines TD(Œª) over state‚Äìaction pairs with importance sampling ideas from our previous work. We prove that, given training under any …õ-soft policy, the algorithm converges w.p.1 to a close approximation (as in Tsitsiklis and Van Roy, 1997; Tadic, 2001) to the action-value function for an arbitrary target policy. Variations of the algorithm designed to reduce variance introduce additional bias but are also guaranteed convergent. We also illustrate our method empirically on a small policy evaluation problem. Our current results are limited to episodic tasks with episodes of bounded length. 1 Although Q-learning remains the most popular of all reinforcement learning algorithms, it has been known since about 1996 that it is unsound with linear function approximation (see Gordon, 1995; Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis, 1996). The most telling counterexample, due to Baird (1995) is a seven-state Markov decision process with linearly independent feature vectors, for which an exact solution exists, yet 1 This is a re-typeset version of an article published in the Proceedings

Three Companions for Data Mining in First Order Logic Three companion systems, Claudien, ICL and Tilde, are  presented. They use a common representation for examples and hypotheses:  each example is represented by a relational database. This contrasts  with the classical inductive logic programming systems such as  Progol and Foil. It is argued that this representation is closer to attribute  value learning and hence more natural.  Furthermore, the three systems can be considered first order upgrades of  typical data mining systems, which induce association rules, classification  rules or decision trees respectively.  1

Experiments on human-robot communication with Robota, an imitative learning and communicating doll robot. Imitation 1 and communication behaviours are important means of interaction between humans and robots. In experiments on robot teaching by demonstration, imitation and communication behaviours can be used by the demonstrator to drive the robot's attention to the demonstrated task. In a children game, they play an important role to engage the interaction between the child and the robot and to stimulate the child's interest. In this work, we study how imitation skills can be used for teaching a robot a symbolic communication system to describe its actions and perceptions. We report on experiments in which we study human-robot interactions using a doll robot. Robota is a robot, whose shape is similar to that of a doll, and which has the capacity to learn, imitate and communicate. Through simple phototaxis behaviour, the robot can imitate (mirror) the arms and head's movements of a demonstrator. The robot is controlled by a Dynamical Recurrent Associative memory Architecture (DRAMA), wh...

Argumentation-Based Abduction in Disjunctive Logic Programming In this paper we propose an argumentation-based semantic framework,  called DAS, for disjunctive logic programming. The basic idea  is to translate a disjunctive logic program into an argumentationtheoretic  framework. One unique feature of our proposed framework  is to consider the disjunctions of negative literals as possible assumptions  so as to represent incomplete information. In our framework,  three semantics PDH, CDH and WFDH are defined by three kinds of  acceptable hypotheses to represent credulous, moderate and skeptical  reasoning in AI, respectively. Further more, our semantic framework  can be extended to a wider class than that of disjunctive programs  (called bi-disjunctive logic programs). In addition to being a first serious  attempt of establishing an argumentation-theoretic framework  for disjunctive logic programming, DAS integrates and naturally extends  many key semantics, such as the minimal models, EGCWA, the  well-founded model, and the disjunctive stable models. In particular,  novel and interesting argumentation-theoretic characterizations of  the EGCWA and the disjunctive stable semantics are shown. Thus  the framework presented in this paper does not only provide a new  way of performing argumentation (abduction) in disjunctive deductive  databases, but also is a simple, intuitive and unifying semantic framework  for disjunctive logic programming.

A Multimodal Shopping Assistant for Home E-Commerce Electronic Commerce has rapidly grown with the expansion of the Internet. E-commerce has also become a promising field for applying agent and Artificial Intelligence technologies. Software agents help to automate a variety of tasks including those involved in buying and selling products over the Internet. In this paper, we describe a multimodal intelligent Shopping Assistant developed in the EMBASSI project [1]. EMBASSI is a project involving more than twenty big German companies and sponsored by BMBF [3]. Its goal is not to focus on the unlimited possibilities of this technology, but rather on the individual prerequisites of the human in contact with it. Therefore, the user interfaces of a big class of appliances and systems, including shopping and ecommerce, need to be easily and efficiently accessible for everyone, taking into account psychological and ergonomic aspects and using innovative interaction techniques by realization of intelligent anthropomorphous assistants.

Less is More: Active Learning with Support Vector Machines We describe a simple active learning heuristic  which greatly enhances the generalization behavior  of support vector machines (SVMs) on several  practical document classification tasks. We  observe a number of benefits, the most surprising  of which is that a SVM trained on a wellchosen  subset of the available corpus frequently  performs better than one trained on all available  data. The heuristic for choosing this subset is  simple to compute, and makes no use of information  about the test set. Given that the training  time of SVMs depends heavily on the training  set size, our heuristic not only offers better performance  with fewer data, it frequently does so  in less time than the naive approach of training  on all available data.  1.

Path Materialization Revisited: An Efficient Storage Model for XML Data XML is emerging as a new major standard for representing data on the world wide web. Several XML storage models have been proposed to store XML data in di#erent database management systems. The unique feature of model-mappingbased approaches is that no DTD information is required for XML data storage. In this paper, we present a new modelmapping -based storage model, called XParent. Unlike the existing work on model-mapping-based approaches that emphasized on converting XML documents to/from database schema and translation of XML queries into SQL queries, in this paper, we focus ourselves on the e#ectiveness of storage models in terms of query processing. We study the key issues that a#ect query performance, namely, storage schema design (storing XML data across multiple tables) and path materialization (storing path information in databases). We show that similar but di#erent storage models significantly a#ect query performance. A performance study is conducted using three data sets and query sets. The experimental results are presented.

Analyzing the Effectiveness and Applicability Of Co-Training Recently there has been significant interest in supervised learning algorithms that combine labeled and unlabeled data for text learning tasks. The co-training setting [1] applies to datasets that have a natural separation of their features into two disjoint sets. We demonstrate that when learning from labeled and unlabeled data, algorithms explicitly leveraging a natural independent split of the features outperform algorithms that do not. When a natural split does not exist, co-training algorithms that manufacture a feature split may out-perform algorithms not using a split. These results help explain why co-training algorithms are both discriminative in nature and robust to the assumptions of their embedded classifiers.

Multi-item Auctions for Automatic Negotiation Available resources can often be limited with regard to the number of demands. In this paper we propose an approach for solving this problem which consists of using the mechanisms of multi-item auctions for allocating the resources to a set of software agents. We consider the resource problem as a market in which there are vendor agents and buyer agents which trade on items representing the resources. These agents use multi-item auctions which are viewed here as a process of automatic negotiation, and implemented as a network of intelligent software agents. In this negotiation, agents exhibit different acquisition capabilities which let them act differently depending on the current context or situation of the market. For example, the ‚Äùricher ‚Äù an agent is, the more items it can buy, i.e. the more resources it can acquire. We present a model for this approach based on the English auction, then we discuss experimental evidence of such a model.

Towards Data Warehouse Design This paper focuses on data warehouse modelling. The conceptual model we defined, is based on object concepts extended with specific concepts like generic classes, temporal classes and archive classes. The temporal classes are used to store the detailed evolutions and the archive classes store the summarised data evolutions. We also provide a flexible concept allowing the administrator to define historised parts and non-historised parts into the warehouse schema. Moreover, we introduce constraints which configure the data warehouse behaviour and these various parts. To validate our propositions, we describe a prototype dedicated to the data warehouse design.

Reclustering of High Energy Physics Data The coming high-energy physics experiments will store Petabytes of data into object databases. Analysis jobs will frequently traverse collections containing millions of stored objects. Clustering is one of the most effective means to enhance the performance of these applications. This paper presents a reclustering algorithm for independent objects contained in multiple possibly overlapping collections on secondary storage. The algorithm decomposes the stored objects into a number of independent chunks and then maps these chunks to a traveling salesman problem. Under a set of realistic assumptions the number of disk seeks is reduced almost to the theoretical minimum. Experimental results obtained from a prototype are included.  1 Introduction  We consider data analysis on secondary storage.

Multidimensional Data Modeling for Complex Data Systems for On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) considerably ease the process of analyzing business  data and have become widely used in industry. OLAP systems primarily employ multidimensional  data models to structure their data. However, current multidimensional data models fall short in their  ability to model the complex data found in some real-world application domains. The paper presents  nine requirements to multidimensional data models, each of which is exemplified by a real-world, clinical  case study. A survey of the existing models reveals that the requirements not currently met include  support for many-to-many relationships between facts and dimensions, built-in support for handling  change and time, and support for uncertainty as well as different levels of granularity in the data. The  paper defines an extended multidimensional data model, which addresses all nine requirements. Along  with the model, we present an associated algebra, and outline how to implement the model using relational  databases.

Anomaly Driven Concept Acquisition In this paper, we identify some principles of Maturana and Varela's autopoiesis theory and Piaget's theory of child development, both of which fall into the constructivist category of epistemology. We then apply them to the problem of autonomous concept acquisition for artificial agents. One consequence of constructivist philosophy is that concept acquistion should be possible in situations (anomalies) which were completely unforeseen by a human designer of the system. Another major consequence is that concepts should not merely be defined on the formal logical level, but should be rooted in sensorimotor interaction with the environment. This requires the existence of an intermediate level in the architecture which allows the construction of original response patterns. We also consider the computational implications of the Piagetian concept of integrating environment-driven and model-driven tendencies when searching for new concepts (known as accommodation and assimilation respectively...

Principles of Intention Reconsideration We present a framework that enables a belief-desire-intention (BDI) agent to dynamically choose its intention reconsideration policy in order to perform optimally in accordance with the current state of the environment. Our framework integrates an abstract BDI agent architecture with the decision theoretic model for discrete deliberation scheduling of Russell and Wefald. As intention reconsideration determines an agent's commitment to its plans, this work increases the level of autonomy in agents, as it pushes the choice of commitment level from design-time to run-time. This makes it possible for an agent to operate effectively in dynamic and open environments, whose behaviour is not known at design time. Following a precise formal definition of the framework, we present an empirical analysis that evaluates the run-time policy in comparison with design-time policies. We show that an agent utilising our framework outperforms agents with fixed policies.

Flexible Process Planning And Production Control Using Co-Operative Agent Systems Nowadays, one of the greatest challenges companies have to face is the change towards flexible and demand-driven production. More information has to be handled and a considerable speed-up of development and manufacturing processes is needed. However, the actual situation is characterized by strong borderlines between process planning, production control and scheduling systems, caused by extreme specialisation and independent historical paths of system evolution. This gap implies loss of time and of information. Thus, there is a strong need for innovative concepts for management and control of integrated information logistics, production scheduling and process planning.  Agent-based information technologies like the innovative concept of co-operative agent systems are promising approaches for more flexible and distributed production networks. Agents are autonomously, co-operatively and goal-oriented acting intelligent software units. The use of agents for managing information within production control and process planning makes short term and flexible reaction to unexpected events and disturbances in manufacturing (e.g. break down of machines or lack of other resources as well as unexpected change of market situation) possible. Thus, enterprises will react to changing requirements in a more flexible way and will be able to face the challenges of international competition successfully.

The algorithms operate on the basis of URL strings and linkage data: the type of information easily available from web proxies and crawlers. Identification of mirrored hosts can improve web-based information retrieval in several ways: First, by identifying mirrored hosts, search engines can avoid storing and returning duplicate documents. Second, several new information retrieval techniques for the Web make inferences based on the explicit links among hypertext documents -- mirroring perturbs their graph model and degrades performance. Third, mirroring information can be used to redirect users to alternate mirror sites to compensate for various failures, and can thus improve the performance of web browsers and proxies.  # This work was presented at the Workshop on Organizing Web Space at the Fourth ACM Conference on Digital Libraries 1999.

Viewpoint-Invariant Learning and Detection of Human Heads We present a method to learn models of human heads for the purpose of detection from different viewing angles. We focus on a model where objects are represented as constellations of rigid features (parts). Variability is represented by a joint probability density function (pdf) on the shape of the constellation. In a first stage, the method automatically identifies distinctive features in the training set using an interest operator followed by vector quantization. The set of model parameters, including the shape pdf, is then learned using expectation maximization. Experiments show good generalization performance to novel viewpoints and unseen faces. Performance is above    % correct with less than    s computation time per image.

Bottom-up Partial Deduction of Logic Programs In this paper, we develop a solid theoretical foundation for a bottom-up program transformation, capable of specialising a logic program with respect to a set of unit clauses. Extending a well-known operator, we define a bottom-up partial deduction operator and prove correctness of the transformation with respect to the S-semantics. We also show how, within this framework, a concrete control strategy can be designed. The transformation can be used as a stand-alone specialisation technique, useful when a program needs to be specialised with respect to its internal structure (e.g., a library of predicates with respect to an abstract data type) instead of a single goal. Moreover, the bottom-up transformation can be usefully combined with a more traditional top-down partial deduction strategy.

Conflict Resolution in Collaborative Planning Dialogues In a collaborative planning environment in which the agents are autonomous and heterogeneous, it is  inevitable that discrepancies in the agents' beliefs result in conflicts during the planning process. In such  cases, it is important that the agents engage in collaborative negotiation to resolve the detected conflicts  in order to determine what should constitute their shared plan of actions and shared beliefs. This paper  presents a plan-based model for conflict detection and resolution in collaborative planning dialogues.  Our model specifies how a collaborative system should detect conflicts that arise between the system  and its user during the planning process. If the detected conflicts warrant resolution, our model initiates  collaborative negotiation in an attempt to resolve the conflicts in the agent's beliefs. In addition, when  multiple conflicts arise, our model identifies and addresses the most effective aspect in its pursuit of  conflict resolution. Furthermore, by captur...

Discovering And Mining User Web-Page Traversal Patterns As the popularity of WWW explodes, a massive amount of data is gathered by Web servers in the form of Web access logs. This is a rich source of information for understanding Web user surfing behavior. Web Usage Mining, also known as Web Log Mining, is an application of data mining algorithms to Web access logs to find trends and regularities in Web users' traversal patterns. The results of Web Usage Mining have been used in improving Web site design, business and marketing decision support, user profiling, and Web server system performance. In this thesis we study the application of assisted exploration of OLAP data cubes and scalable sequential pattern mining algorithms to Web log analysis. In multidimensional OLAP analysis, standard statistical measures are applied to assist the user at each step to explore the interesting parts of the cube. In addition, a scalable sequential pattern mining algorithm is developed to discover commonly traversed paths in large data sets. Our experimental and performance studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm in comparison to previously developed sequential pattern mining algorithms.

Towards a Highly-Scalable and Effective Metasearch Engine A metasearch engine is a system that supports unified access to multiple local search engines. Database selection is one of the main challenges in building a large-scale metasearch engine. The problem is to efficiently and accurately determine a small number of potentially useful local search engines to invoke for each user query. In order to enable accurate selection, metadata that reect the contents of each search engine need to be collected and used. In this paper, we propose a highly scalable and accurate database selection method. This method has several novel features. First, the metadata for representing the contents of all search engines are organized into a single integrated representative. Such a representative yields both computation efficiency and storage efficiency. Second, our selection method is based on a theory for ranking search engines optimally. Experimental results indicate that this new method is very effective. An operational prototype system has been built based on the proposed approach.

A Sequence-Based Object-Oriented Model for Video Databases Structuration, annotation and composition, are amidst the most crucial modeling issues that video editing and querying in the context of a database entail. In this paper, we propose a sequence-based, object-oriented data model that addresses them in an unified, yet orthogonal way. This orthogonality allows to capture the interactions between these three aspects, i.e. annotations may be attached to any level of video structuration, and the composition operators preserve the structurations and annotations of the argument videos. The proposed model reuses concepts stemming from temporal databases, so that operators defined in this latter setting may be used to query it. Accordingly, the query language for video databases proposed in this paper, is a variant of a temporal extension of ODMG's OQL. The main components of the proposal have been formalized and implemented on top of an object-oriented DBMS.  Keywords: video databases, sequence databases, object-oriented databases, ODMG.  R'esum...

Varieties of Affect and the CogAff Architecture Schema In the last decade and a half, the amount of work on affect in general and emotion in particular has grown, in empirical psychology, cognitive science and AI, both for scientific purposes and for the purpose of designing synthetic characters, e.g. in games and entertainments. Such work understandably starts from concepts of ordinary language (e.g. ‚Äúemotion‚Äù, ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù, ‚Äúmood‚Äù, etc.). However, these concepts can be deceptive: the words appear to have clear meanings but are used in very imprecise and systematically ambiguous ways. This is often because of explicit or implicit pre-scientific theories about mental states and process. More sophisticated theories can provide a basis for deeper and more precise concepts, as has happened in physics and chemistry. In the Cognition and Affect project we have been attempting to explore the benefits of developing architecture-based concepts, i.e. starting with specifications of architectures for complete agents and then finding out what sorts of states and processes are supported by those architectures. So, instead of presupposing one theory of the architecture and explicitly or implicitly basing concepts on that, we define a space of architectures generated by the CogAff architecture schema, where each supports different collections of concepts. In that space we focus on one architecture H-Cogaff, a particularly rich instance of the CogAff architecture schema, conjectured as a theory of normal adult human information processing. The architecture-based concepts that it supports provide a framework for defining with greater precision than previously a host of mental concepts, including affective concepts. We then find that these map more or less loosely onto various pre-theoretical concepts, such as ‚Äúemotion‚Äù, etc. We indicate some of the variety of emotion concepts generated by the H-Cogaff architecture A different architecture, supporting a different range of mental concepts might be appropriate for exploring affective states of other animals, for instance insects, reptiles, or other mammals, and young children. 1

Oblivious Decision Trees and Abstract Cases In this paper, we address the problem of case-based learning in the presence of irrelevant features. We review previous work on attribute selection and present a new algorithm, Oblivion, that carries out greedy pruning of oblivious decision trees, which effectively store a set of abstract cases in memory. We hypothesize that this approach will efficiently identify relevant features even when they interact, as in parity concepts. We report experimental results on artificial domains that support this hypothesis, and experiments with natural domains that show improvement in some cases but not others. In closing, we discuss the implications of our experiments, consider additional work on irrelevant features, and outline some directions for future research.

Partial-Order Planning with Concurrent Interacting Actions In order to generate plans for agents with multiple actuators, agent teams, or distributed  controllers, we must be able to represent and plan using concurrent actions with  interacting effects. This has historically been considered a challenging task requiring a  temporal planner with the ability to reason explicitly about time. We show that with  simple modifications, the STRIPS action representation language can be used to represent  interacting actions. Moreover, algorithms for partial-order planning require only small  modifications in order to be applied in such multiagent domains. We demonstrate this fact  by developing a sound and complete partial-order planner for planning with concurrent interacting  actions, POMP, that extends existing partial-order planners in a straightforward  way. These results open the way to the use of partial-order planners for the centralized  control of cooperative multiagent systems.  1. Introduction  In order to construct plans for agents with mul...

Continuous-Time Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) is a general framework which studies how to exploit the structure of actions and tasks to accelerate policy learning in large domains. Prior work in hierarchical RL, such as the MAXQ method, has been limited to the discrete-time discounted reward semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) model. This paper generalizes the MAXQ method to continuous-time discounted and average reward SMDP models. We describe two hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithms: continuous-time discounted reward MAXQ and continuous-time average reward MAXQ. We apply these algorithms to a complex multiagent AGV scheduling problem, and compare their performance and speed with each other, as well as several well-known AGV scheduling heuristics. 1.

InfoBeans - Configuration of Personalized Information Assistants With the enormous amount of data contained in the WWW, one of the crucial tasks a user has to face is the identification and aggregation of relevant pieces of information to satisfy her current information needs. This paper presents an approach to the system--supported configuration of individualized information services. The programming--by--demonstration approach pursued by the InfoBeans releases the user from learning a programming language or dealing with technical subtleties. The first version of this system will be released this fall.

Argos: Efficient Refresh in an XQL-Based Web Caching System The Web has become a major conduit to information repositories of all kinds. Web caches are employed to store a web view to provide an immediate response to recurring queries. However, the accuracy of the replicates in web caches encounters challenges due to the dynamicity of web data. We are thus developing and evaluating a web caching system equipped with an efficient refresh strategy. With the assistance of a novel index structure, the Aggregation Path Index (APIX), we built Argos, a web cache system based on the GMD XQL query engine. Argos achieves a high degree of self-maintenance by diagnosing irrelevant data update cases and hence greatly improves the refresh performance of the materialized web view. We also report preliminary experimental results assessing the performance of Argos compared to from scratch evaluation.  1.

Instructable and Adaptive Web Agents that Learn to Retrieve and Extract Information . We present a system for rapidly and easily building instructable and selfadaptive Web agents for information-retrieval and information-extraction tasks. Our Wisconsin Adaptive Web Assistant (Wawa) constructs a Web agent by accepting user preferences in form of instructions and adapting the agent's behavior as it encounters new information. Wawa has two neural networks that are responsible for the adaptive capabilities of its agents. User-provided instructions are compiled into these neural networks and are modified via training examples. Users can create these training examples by rating pages that are retrieved by Wawa, but more importantly our system uses techniques from reinforcement learning to internally create its own examples. Users can also provide additional instruction throughout the life of an agent. We evaluate Wawa on a "home-page finder" agent and a "seminarannouncement extractor" agent.

Business Process Coordination: State of the Art, Trends, and Open Issues Over the past decade, there has been a lot of  work in developing middleware for integrating  and automating enterprise business processes.  Today, with the growth in e-commerce and the  blurring of enterprise boundaries, there is  renewed interest in business process  coordination, especially for inter-organizational  processes. This paper provides a historical  perspective on technologies for intra- and interenterprise  business processes, reviews the state  of the art, and exposes some open research  issues. We include a discussion of process-based  coordination and event/rule-based coordination,  and corresponding products and standards  activities. We provide an overview of the rather  extensive work that has been done on advanced  transaction models for business processes, and of  the fledgling area of business process  intelligence.  1.

muscettola98reformulating
Reformulating Temporal Plans For Efficient Execution The Simple Temporal Network formalism permits significant flexibility in specifying the occurrence time of events in temporal plans. However, to retain this flexibility during execution, there is a need to propagate the actual execution times of past events so that the occurrence windows of future events are adjusted appropriately. Unfortunately, this may run afoul of tight real-time control requirements that dictate extreme efficiency. The performance may be improved by restricting the propagation. However, a fast, locally propagating, execution controller may incorrectly execute a consistent plan. To resolve this dilemma, we identify a class of dispatchable networks that are guaranteed to execute correctly under local propagation. We show that every consistent temporal plan can be reformulated as an equivalent dispatchable network, and we present an algorithm that constructs such a network. Moreover, the constructed network is shown to have a minimum number of edges among all such n...

SICS MarketSpace - An Agent-Based Market Infrastructure . We present a simple and uniform communication framework for an agent-based market infrastructure, the goal of which is to enable automation of consumer goods markets distributed over the Internet. The framework consists of an information model for participant interests and an interaction model that defines a basic vocabulary for advertising, searching, negotiating and settling deals. The information model is based on structured documents representing contracts and representations of constrained sets of contracts called interests. The interaction model is asynchronous message communication in a speech act based language, similar to, but simpler than, KQML [7] and FIPA ACL [8]. We also discuss integration of an agent-based market infrastructure with the web. 1

naumann00completeness
Completeness of Information Sources Information quality plays a crucial role in every application that integrates data from autonomous sources. However, information quality is hard to measure and complex to consider for the tasks of information integration, even if the integrating sources cooperate. We present a systematic and formal approach to the measurement of information quality and the combination of such measurements for information integration. Our approach is based on a value model that incorporates both extensional value (coverage) and intensional value (density) of information. For both aspects we provide merge functions for adequately scoring integrated results. Also, we combine the two criteria to an overall completeness criterion that formalizes the intuitive notion of completeness of query results. This completeness measure is a valuable tool to assess source size and to predict result sizes of queries in integrated information systems. We propose this measure as an important step towards the usage of information quality for source selection, query planning, query optimization, and quality feedback to users.

Robust Finger Tracking with Multiple Cameras This paper gives an overview of a system for robustly tracking the 3D position and orientation of a finger using a few closely spaced cameras. Accurate results are obtained by combining features of stereo range images and color images. This work also provides a design framework for combining multiple sources of information, including stereo range images, color segmentations, shape information and various constraints. This information is used in robust model fitting techniques to track highly over-constrained models of deformable objects: fingers.

rey01location
Location Systems for Ubiquitous Computing To serve us well, emerging mobile computing applications will need to know the physical location of things so that they can record them and report them to us: What lab bench was I standing by when I prepared these tissue samples? How should our search-and-rescue team move to quickly locate all the avalanche victims? Can I automatically display this stock devaluation chart on the large screen I am standing next to? Researchers are working to meet these and similar needs by developing systems and technologies that automatically locate people, equipment, and other tangibles. Indeed, many systems over the years have addressed the problem of automatic location-sensing. Because each approach solves a slightly different problem or supports different applications, they vary in many parameters, such as the physical phenomena used for location determination, the form factor of the sensing apparatus, power requirements, infrastructure versus portable elements, and resolution in time and space. To make sense of this domain, we have developed a taxonomy to help developers

Case-Based Representation and Learning of Pattern Languages Pattern languages seem to suit case-based reasoning particularly well. Therefore, the problem of inductively learning pattern languages is paraphrased in a case-based manner. A careful investigation requires a formal semantics for case bases together with similarity measures in terms of formal languages. Two basic semantics are introduced and investigated. It turns out that representability problems are major obstacles for case-based learnability. Restricting the attention to so-called proper patterns avoids these representability problems. A couple of learnability results for proper pattern languages are derived both for case-based learning from only positive data and for case-based learning from positive and negative data. Under the so-called competing semantics, we show that the learnability result for positive and negative data can be lifted to the general case of arbitrary patterns. Learning under the standard semantics from positive data is closely related to monotonic language l...

Combining Evolutionary Algorithms With Oblique Decision Trees to Detect Bent-Double Galaxies Decision trees have long been popular in classification as they use simple and easy-to-understand tests at each node. Most variants of decision trees test a single attribute at a node, leading to axis-parallel trees, where the test results in a hyperplane which is parallel to one of the dimensions in the attribute space. These trees can be rather large and inaccurate in cases where the concept to be learned is best approximated by oblique hyperplanes. In such cases, it may be more appropriate to use an oblique decision tree, where the decision at each node is a linear combination of the attributes. Oblique decision trees have not gained wide popularity in part due to the complexity of constructing good oblique splits and the tendency of existing splitting algorithms to get stuck in local minima. Several alternatives have been proposed to handle these problems including randomization in conjunction with deterministic hill-climbing and the use of simulated annealing. In this paper, we use...

hatzilygeroudis02multiinference
Multi-inference with Multi-neurules Neurules are a type of hybrid rules combining a symbolic and a connectionist representation. There are two disadvantages of neurules. The first is that the created neurule bases usually contain multiple representations of the same piece of knowledge. Also, the inference mechanism is rather connectionism oriented than symbolism oriented, thus reducing naturalness. To remedy these deficiencies, we introduce an extension to neurules, called multineurules, and an alternative inference process, which is rather symbolism oriented. Experimental results comparing the two inference processes are also presented.

Using Evolutionary Algorithms to Induce Oblique Decision Trees This paper illustrates the application of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) to the problem of oblique decision tree induction. The objectives are to demonstrate that EAs can find classifiers whose accuracy is competitive with other oblique tree construction methods, and that at least in some cases this can be accomplished in a shorter time. Experiments were performed with a (1+1) evolution strategy and a simple genetic algorithm on public domain and artificial data sets. The empirical results suggest that the EAs quickly find competitive classifiers, and that EAs scale up better than traditional methods to the dimensionality of the domain and the number of instances used in training.

To reach the emergent behavior many researcher propagate to plan it within design and analysis of specific systems, as it will not occur by chance.  We are presenting a new way to adaptive agent communication protocols with respect to a possible gain of emergent behavior. Communication protocols can be generated, refined or adapted by the agents autonomously. The approach uses basic concepts of machine learning.

The Belief-Desire-Intention Model of Agency Introduction  Within the ATAL community, the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model has come to be possibly the best known and best studied model of practical reasoning agents. There are several reasons for its success, but perhaps the most compelling are that the BDI model combines a respectable philosophical model of human practical reasoning, (originally developed by Michael Bratman [1]), a number of implementations (in the IRMA architecture [2] and the various PRS-like systems currently available [7]), several successful applications (including the now-famous fault diagnosis system for the space shuttle, as well as factory process control systems and business process management [8]), and finally, an elegant abstract logical semantics, which have been taken up and elaborated upon widely within the agent research community [14, 16]. However, it could be argued that the BDI model is now becoming somewhat dated: the principles of the architecture were established in the mid-1980s,

Scalability requires increasing numbers of new agents and  resources to have no noticeable effect on performance nor to increase administrative complexity. In this  paper a number of implications for techniques and management are discussed. Current research on agent  middleware is briefly described.  1

MySpiders : Evolve your own intelligent Web crawlers Abstract. The dynamic nature of the World Wide Web makes it a challenge to find information that is bothrelevant and recent. Intelligent agents can complement the power of searchengines to meet this challenge. We present a Web tool called MySpiders, which implements an evolutionary algorithm managing a population of adaptive crawlers who browse the Web autonomously. Each agent acts as an intelligent client on behalf of the user, driven by a user query and by textual and linkage clues in the crawled pages. Agents autonomously decide which links to follow, which clues to internalize, when to spawn offspring to focus the search near a relevant source, and when to starve. The tool is available to the public as a threaded Java applet. We discuss the development and deployment of such a system.

kalganova99evolving
Evolving More Efficient Digital Circuits By Allowing Circuit Layout Evolution and Multi-Objective Fitness We use evolutionary search to design combinational logic circuits. The technique is based on evolving the functionality and connectivity of a rectangular array of logic cells whose dimension is defined by the circuit layout. The main idea of this approach is to improve quality of the circuits evolved by the genetic algorithm (GA) by reducing the number of active gates used. We accomplish this by combining two ideas: 1) using multiobjective fitness function; 2) evolving circuit layout. It will be shown that using these two approaches allows us to increase the quality of evolved circuits. The circuits are evolved in two phases. Initially the genome fitness in given by the percentage of output bits that are correct. Once 100% functional circuits have been evolved, the number of gates actually used in the circuit is taken into account in the fitness function. This allows us to evolve circuits with 100% functionality and minimise the number of active gates in circuit structure. The populati...

A Uniform Approach to Programming the World Wide Web We propose a uniform model for programming distributed web applications. The model is based on the concept of web computation places and provides mechanisms to coordinate distributed computations at these places, including peer-to-peer communication between places and a uniform mechanism to initiate computation in remote places. Computations can interact with the flow of http requests and responses, typically as clients, proxies or servers in the web architecture. We have implemented the model using the global pointers and remote service requests provided by the Nexus communication library. We present the model and its rationale, with some illustrative examples, and we describe the implementation.  1 Introduction  Many web applications require a significant amount of computation which may be distributed and requires coordination; these applications use the web infrastructure to good advantage but are often constrained by the architecture, which is fundamentally client-server.

In this view we analyse gaze signals according to their functional meaning rather than to their physical actions. We propose a formalism where a communicative act is represented by two elements: a meaning (that corresponds to a set of goals and beliefs that the agent has the purpose to transmit to the interlocutor) and a signal, that is the nonverbal expression of that meaning. We also outline a methodology to generate messages that coordinate verbal with nonverbal signals.

On Case-Based Learnability of Languages Case-based reasoning is deemed an important technology to alleviate the bottleneck  of knowledge acquisition in Artificial Intelligence (AI). In case-based reasoning,  knowledge is represented in the form of particular cases with an appropriate similarity  measure rather than any form of rules. The case-based reasoning paradigm adopts the  view that an AI system is dynamically changing during its life-cycle which immediately  leads to learning considerations.  Within the present paper, we investigate the problem of case-based learning of  indexable classes of formal languages. Prior to learning considerations, we study the  problem of case-based representability and show that every indexable class is case-based  representable with respect to a fixed similarity measure. Next, we investigate several  models of case-based learning and systematically analyze their strengths as well as  their limitations. Finally, the general approach to case-based learnability of indexable  classes of form...

This paper describes the application of techniques for  characterizing animal behavior to the evaluation of complex  agents. We describe the conditions that lead to the  behavioral variability that requires experimental methods.  We then review the state of the art in psychological  experimental design and analysis, and show its  application to complex agents. We also discuss a specific  methodological concern of agent research: how the  robots versus simulations debate interacts with statistical  evaluation. Finally, we make a specific proposal for  facilitating the use of scientific method. We propose the  creation of a web site that functions as a repository for  platforms suitable for statistical testing, for results determined  on those platforms, and for the agents that have  generated those results.

Visualizing the Structure of the World Wide Web in 3D Hyperbolic Space We visualize the structure of sections of the World Wide Web by constructing graphical representations in 3D hyperbolic space. The felicitous property that hyperbolic space has "more room" than Euclidean space allows more information to be seen amid less clutter, and motion by hyperbolic isometries provides for mathematically elegant navigation. The 3D graphical representations, available in the WebOOGL or VRML file formats, contain link anchors which point to the original pages on the Web itself. We use the Geomview/WebOOGL 3D Web browser as an interface between the 3D representation and the actual documents on the Web. The Web is just one example of a hierarchical tree structure with links "back up the tree" i.e. a directed graph which contains cycles. Our information visualization techniques are appropriate for other types of directed graphs with cycles, such as filesystems with symbolic links. 1 Introduction  The dominant paradigm for World Wide Web navigation is pointing and click...

VideoGraph: A Graphical Object-based Model for Representing and Querying Video Data . Modeling video data poses a great challenge since they do  not have as clear an underlying structure as traditional databases do.  We propose a graphical object-based model, called VideoGraph, in this  paper. This scheme has the following advantages: (1) In addition to semantics  of video individual events, we capture their temporal relationships  as well. (2) The inter-event relationships allow us to deduce implicit  video information. (3) Uncertainty can also be handled by associating the  video event with a temporal Boolean-like expression. This also allows us  to exploit incomplete information. The above features make VideoGraph  very flexible in representing various metadata types extracted from diverse  information sources. To facilitate video retrieval, we also introduce  a formalism for the query language based on path expressions. Query  processing involves only simple traversal of the video graphs.  1 Introduction  We deal with the modeling aspect of video database manageme...

Agent-Based Digital Libraries: Decentralization and Coordination This paper describes agent-based systems and explains why digital libraries should be built with this type of architecture. The primary advantage of agent-based architecture is decentralization, which enables scaling, flexibility, and extensibility. The corresponding requirement is the need to coordinate agent activity. We describe the approach taken by the University of Michigan Digital Library project.  2  1 Introduction Digital libraries are just beginning to evolve. No one is certain what capabilities are needed, nor how they should be organized. It is therefore important to design digital libraries to be as open as possible, so that new collections and services can be easily added to the system. Furthermore, it is essential that libraries be able to scale to become quite large. For us, this implies a decentralized architecture, where there are few if any shared resources and where as much decision making is done as locally as possible.

Patterns as Tools for User Interface Design . Designing usable systems is difficult and designers need effective  tools that are usable themselves. Effective design tools should be based on  proven knowledge of design. Capturing knowledge about the successful design  of usable systems is important for both novice and experienced designers and  traditionally, this knowledge has largely been described in guidelines. However,  guidelines have shown to have problems concerning selection, validity and applicability.  Patterns have emerged as a possible solution to some of the problems  from which guidelines suffer. Patterns focus on the context of a problem and solution  thereby guiding the designer in using the design knowledge. Patterns for  architecture or software engineering are not identical in structure and user interface  design also requires its own structure for patterns, focusing on usability.  This paper explores how patterns for user interface design must be structured in  order to be effective and usable tools for desig...
